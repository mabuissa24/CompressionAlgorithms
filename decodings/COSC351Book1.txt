C.--Price $3.75 (Buckram)                                PREFACEIn April 1949, judgment was rendered in the last of the series of 12Nuernberg war crimes trials which had begun in October 1946, and wereheld pursuant to Allied Control Council Law No. 10. Far from beingof concern solely to lawyers, these trials are of especial interestto soldiers, historians, students of international affairs, andothers. The defendants in these proceedings, charged with war crimesand other offenses against international penal law, were prominentfigures in Hitlers Germany and included such outstanding diplomatsand politicians as the State Secretary of the Foreign Office, vonWeizsaecker, and cabinet ministers von Krosigk and Lammers; militaryleaders such as Field Marshals von Leeb, List, and von Kuechler; SSleaders such as Ohlendorf, Pohl, and Hildebrandt; industrialists suchas Flick, Alfried Krupp, and the directors of I. G. Farben; and leadingprofessional men such as the famous physician Gerhard Rose, and thejurist and Acting Minister of Justice, Schlegelberger.In view of the weight of the accusations and the far-flung activitiesof the defendants, and the extraordinary amount of officialcontemporaneous German documents introduced in evidence, the records ofthese trials constitute a major source of historical material coveringmany events of the fateful years 1933 (and even earlier) to 1945, inGermany and elsewhere in Europe.The Nuernberg trials under Law No. 10 were carried out under thedirect authority of the Allied Control Council, as manifested inthat law, which authorized the establishment of the Tribunals. Thejudicial machinery for the trials, including the Military Tribunalsand the Office, Chief of Counsel for War Crimes, was prescribed byMilitary Government Ordinance No. 7 and was part of the occupationadministration for the American zone, the Office of Military Government(OMGUS). Law No. 10, Ordinance No. 7, and other basic jurisdictional oradministrative documents are printed in full hereinafter.The proceedings in these trials were conducted throughout in the Germanand English languages, and were recorded in full by stenographic notes,and by electrical sound recording of all oral proceedings. The 12cases required over 1,200 days of court proceedings and the transcriptof these proceedings exceeds 330,000 pages, exclusive of hundreds ofdocuments, books, briefs, etc. Publication of all of this material,accordingly, was quite unfeasible. This series, however, contains theindictments, judgments, and other important portions of the recordof the 12 cases, and it is believed that these materials give a fairpicture of the trials, and as full and illuminating a picture as ispossible within the space available. Copies of the entire record of thetrials are available in the Library of Congress, the National Archives,and elsewhere.In some cases, due to time limitations, errors of one sort or anotherhave crept into the translations which were available to the Tribunal.In other cases the same document appears in different trials, or evenat different parts of the same trial, with variations in translation.For the most part these inconsistencies have been allowed to remain andonly such errors as might cause misunderstanding have been corrected.Volume III of this series is dedicated to the case United States ofAmerica _vs._ Josef Altstoetter, et al. (Case 3). This trial hasbecome known as the Justice Case, because all of the defendants heldpositions in the Reich system of justice, as officials of the ReichMinistry of Justice or as judges or prosecutors of the Special Courtsand the Peoples Courts.

XIV                   DECLARATION ON GERMAN ATROCITIES                         [Moscow Declaration]                       Released November 1, 1943THE UNITED KINGDOM, the United States and the Soviet Union havereceived from many quarters evidence of atrocities, massacres andcold-blooded mass executions which are being perpetrated by theHitlerite forces in the many countries they have overrun and from whichthey are now being steadily expelled. The brutalities of Hitleritedomination are no new thing and all the peoples or territories intheir grip have suffered from the worst form of government by terror.What is new is that many of these territories are now being redeemedby the advancing armies of the liberating Powers and that in theirdesperation, the recoiling Hitlerite Huns are redoubling their ruthlesscruelties. This is now evidenced with particular clearness by monstrouscrimes of the Hitlerites on the territory of the Soviet Union whichis being liberated from the Hitlerites, and on French and Italianterritory.Accordingly, the aforesaid three allied Powers, speaking in theinterests of the thirty-two [thirty-three] United Nations, herebysolemnly declare and give full warning of their declaration as follows:At the time of the granting of any armistice to any government whichmay be set up in Germany, those German officers and men and membersof the Nazi party who have been responsible for, or have taken aconsenting part in the above atrocities, massacres, and executions,will be sent back to the countries in which their abominable deeds weredone in order that they may be judged and punished according to thelaws of these liberated countries and of the free governments whichwill be created therein. Lists will be compiled in all possible detailfrom all these countries having regard especially to the invaded partsof the Soviet Union, to Poland and Czechoslovakia, to Yugoslavia andGreece, including Crete and other islands, to Norway, Denmark, theNetherlands, Belgium, Luxemburg, France and Italy.Thus, the Germans who take part in wholesale shootings of Italianofficers or in the execution of French, Dutch, Belgian, or Norwegianhostages or of Cretan peasants, or who have shared in the slaughtersinflicted on the people of Poland or in territories of the Soviet Unionwhich are now being swept clear of the enemy, will know that they willbe brought back to the scene of their crimes and judged on the spot bythe peoples whom they have outraged. Let those who have hitherto notimbrued their hands with innocent blood beware lest they join the ranksof the guilty, for most assuredly the three allied Powers will pursuethem to the uttermost ends of the earth and will deliver them to theiraccusers in order that justice may be done.The above declaration is without prejudice to the case of the majorcriminals, whose offences have no particular geographical localisationand who will be punished by the joint decision of the Governments ofthe Allies.

(Case 3). Of the sixteendefendants indicted, nine were officials in the Reich Ministry ofJustice. The two persons who held the position of Reich Minister ofJustice during the Hitler regime, Franz Guertner and Georg Thierack,were both dead before the indictment was filed. Between Guertnersdeath in January 1941 and Thieracks appointment in August 1942, thedefendant Schlegelberger served as Acting Reich Minister of Justice.The defendants Schlegelberger, Rothenberger, and Klemm each had heldthe position of Under Secretary (Staatssekretaer, also translated asState Secretary) in the Reich Ministry of Justice. Two other officialsof this Ministry were indicted but not tried: the defendant Westphalcommitted suicide in Nuernberg jail after indictment and before theopening of the trial; a mistrial was declared as to the defendantEngert, whose physical condition prevented his presence in courtfor most of the trial. The defendants who were not officials of theReich Ministry of Justice included the chief public prosecutor of thePeoples Court and several prosecutors and judges of both the SpecialCourts and the Peoples Courts. Both the Special and the PeoplesCourts were established as important parts of the administration ofjustice during the Nazi regime.All sixteen defendants named in the indictment were charged withcriminal responsibility under the first three counts of the indictment.Count one charged participation in a conspiracy to commit war crimesand crimes against humanity; count two alleged the commission ofwar crimes against civilians of territories occupied by Germany andagainst members of the armed forces of nations at war with Germanyafter September 1939; count three charged the commission of crimesagainst humanity, including offenses against both German civiliansand the nationals of occupied countries, after the outbreak of WorldWar II. The specific offenses charged included murder, persecution onpolitical, racial, and religious grounds, deportation and enslavement,plunder of private property, torture and other atrocities. Count fourcharged seven of the defendants with membership in the SS, the SD, orthe Leadership Corps of the Nazi Party, all organizations declared tobe criminal by the International Military Tribunal.During the course of the trial the Tribunal ruled with respect to countone that neither the Charter of the International Military Tribunalnor Control Council Law No. 10 has defined conspiracy to commit awar crime or crime against humanity as a separate substantive crime;therefore, this Tribunal has no jurisdiction to try any defendant upona charge of conspiracy considered as a separate substantive offense.However, the Tribunal ruled further that count one also allegesunlawful participation in the formulation and execution of plans tocommit war crimes and crimes against humanity which actually involvedthe commission of such crimes. We therefore cannot properly strikethe whole of count one from the indictment, but, insofar as count onecharges the commission of the alleged crime of conspiracy as a separatesubstantive offense, distinct from any war crime or crime againsthumanity, the Tribunal will disregard that charge. Judge Blair, in aseparate opinion filed at the time of judgment, dissented from thisruling, declaring that the Tribunal should have declared that themilitary tribunals created under Ordinance No. 7 had jurisdiction overconspiracy to commit any and all crimes defined in Article II ofControl Council Law No. 10.Of the 14 defendants who stood trial to the end, ten were convicted onone or more counts, and four were acquitted on all counts.The Justice Case was tried at the Palace of Justice in Nuernbergbefore Military Tribunal III. Early in June 1947, the presiding judgebecame ill, and for this reason the sessions of the Tribunal hadto be temporarily suspended. Thereupon the Tribunal designated theother two members and the alternate member as commissioners of theTribunal to hear the testimony of a number of available witnesseswhose affidavits had been introduced in evidence by the prosecutionand who had been requested for cross-examination by the defense.Accordingly, the commissioners held hearings to take the furthertestimony of 13 prosecution affiants on 3, 4, and 5 June 1947. Thepresiding judge still remained incapacitated due to severe illness.Consequently, on 19 June 1947, shortly before the beginning of thedefense case, the Tribunal was reconstituted pursuant to Article IIof Military Government Ordinance No. 7, and the alternate judge, whohad been present throughout the sessions of the trial, replaced theincapacitated member. Hearings before the Tribunal or the commissionersof the Tribunal were held on 129 separate days. The trial, fromindictment to judgment, lasted 11 months. The course of the trial andsubsequent related proceedings is shown in the following table:    Indictment filed                            4 January 1947    Arraignment                                17 February 1947    Prosecution opening statement               5 March 1947    Defense opening statements                 23 June 1947    Prosecution closing statement           1314 October 1947    Defense closing statements              1418 October 1947    Prosecution rebuttal closing               18 October 1947    Final statements of defendants             18 October 1947    Judgment                                  34 December 1947    Sentences                                   4 December 1947    Affirmation of sentences by the Military      Governor of the United States Zone of      Occupation                               18 January 1949    Order of the Supreme Court of the United      States denying Writs of Habeas Corpus.    2 May 1949The English transcript of the Court proceedings, including thejudgment, the separate opinion of Judge Blair, and the sentences, runsto 10,964 mimeographed pages. The prosecution introduced into evidence641 written exhibits (some of which contained several documents),and the defense 1,452 written exhibits. The exhibits offered bythe prosecution and the defense contained documents, photographs,affidavits, interrogatories, letters, charts, and other writtenevidence. Approximately 600 of these written exhibits were affidavits,more than 500 of which were introduced by the defense. The Tribunal andthe members thereof sitting as commissioners heard the testimony ofapproximately 140 witnesses, including that of twelve of the defendantswho elected to testify. Each of the defendants who testified wassubject to examination on behalf of the other defendants. Many of thewitnesses heard by the Tribunal itself, and all of the witnesses whosetestimony was taken in the commission, were prosecution affiants whowere called for cross-examination by the defense.The case-in-chief of the prosecution began on 5 March 1947 and endedon 5 June 1947, subject to the understanding that several prosecutionaffiants requested for cross-examination by the defense and notimmediately available for cross-examination, could be cross-examined bythe defense during the defense case. The Tribunal was in recess between28 May 1947 and 23 June 1947, during which period the commissioners ofthe Tribunals held hearings on three successive days. The defense casebegan on 23 June 1947 and ended on 26 September 1947. The Tribunal wasin recess between 26 September 1947 and 13 October 1947, to give boththe prosecution and the defense additional time to prepare the closingstatements.The members of the Tribunal and prosecution and defense counsel arelisted on the ensuing pages.

COUNT ONE--THE COMMON DESIGN AND CONSPIRACY1. Between January 1933 and April 1945 all of the defendants herein,acting pursuant to a common design, unlawfully, willfully, andknowingly did conspire and agree together and with each other and withdivers other persons, to commit war crimes and crimes against humanity,as defined in Control Council Law No. 10, Article II.2. Throughout the period covered by this indictment all of thedefendants herein, acting in concert with each other and with others,unlawfully, willfully, and knowingly were principals in, accessoriesto, ordered, abetted, took a consenting part in, and were connectedwith plans and enterprises involving, the commission of war crimes andcrimes against humanity.3. All of the defendants herein, acting in concert with each otherand with others, unlawfully, willfully, and knowingly participated asleaders, organizers, instigators, and accomplices in the formulationand execution of the said common design, conspiracy, plans, andenterprises to commit, and which involved the commission of, warcrimes and crimes against humanity, and accordingly are individuallyresponsible for their own acts and for all acts performed by any personor persons in execution of the said common design, conspiracy, plans,and enterprises.4. The said common design, conspiracy, plans, and enterprises embracedthe commission of war crimes and crimes against humanity, as set forthin counts two and three of this indictment, in that the defendantsunlawfully, willfully, and knowingly encouraged, aided, abetted, andparticipated in the commission of atrocities and offenses againstpersons and property, including plunder of private property, murder,extermination, enslavement, deportation, unlawful imprisonment,torture, persecutions on political, racial, and religious grounds,and ill-treatment of, and other inhumane acts against, thousands ofpersons, including German civilians, nationals of other countries, andprisoners of war.5. It was a part of the said common design, conspiracy, plans, andenterprises to enact, issue, enforce, and give effect to certainpurported statutes, decrees, and orders, which were criminal both ininception and execution, and to work with the Gestapo, SS, SD, SIPO,and RSHA for criminal purposes, in the course of which the defendants,by distortion and denial of judicial and penal process, committedthe murders, brutalities, cruelties, tortures, atrocities, and otherinhumane acts, more fully described in counts two and three of thisindictment.6. The said common design, conspiracy, plans, and enterprises embracedthe assumption by the Reich Ministry of Justice of total control ofthe administration of justice, including preparation of legislationconcerning all branches of law, and control of the courts andprisons. The supreme administration of justice in all German stateswas transferred to the Reich Ministry of Justice in 1934. Thereupon,certain extraordinary courts of a predominantly political nature, withwide and arbitrary criminal jurisdiction, were superimposed upon theexisting ordinary court system. The Peoples Court (Volksgerichtshof)became the court of original and final jurisdiction in cases of hightreason and treason. This court itself had jurisdiction over theinvestigation and prosecution of all cases before it, and there wasno appeal from its decision. The courts territorial jurisdictionwas extended not only to all annexed countries of the Reich but alsoto the Protectorate (Bohemia and Moravia) in 1939. Beginning in1933, Special Courts (Sondergerichte) also were superimposed uponthe ordinary court system under the Reich Ministry of Justice. TheseSpecial Courts were of a character which had been outlawed until theNSDAP seizure of power. Jurisdiction of these Special Courts extendedto all political cases, as well as to all acts deemed inimical toeither the Party, the government, or continued prosecution of thewar. At least one Special Court was attached to every court of appeal(Oberlandesgericht); public prosecutors could arbitrarily refer theretoany case from the local courts (Amtsgerichte) or from the criminaldivision of the district courts (Landgerichte). Despite guaranties inthe Weimar Constitution and the German Judicature Act, that no one maybe deprived of his competent judge, and prohibitions against irregulartribunals, these courts were imposed upon Germany, as well as upon theProtectorate and the occupied countries.7. The said common design, conspiracy, plans, and enterprisesembraced the use of the judicial process as a powerful weapon for thepersecution and extermination of all opponents of the Nazi regimeregardless of nationality and for the persecution and exterminationof races. The special political tribunals mentioned above visitedcruel punishment and death upon political opponents and members ofcertain racial and national groups. The Peoples Court was presidedover by a minority of trusted Nazi lawyers, and a majority of equallytrusted laymen appointed by Hitler from the Elite Guard and Partyhierarchy. The Peoples Court in collaboration with the Gestapo becamea terror court, notorious for the severity of punishment, secrecy ofproceedings, and denial to the accused of all semblance of judicialprocess. Punishment was meted out by Special Courts to victims undera law which condemned all who offended the healthy sentiment of thepeople. Independence of the judiciary was destroyed. Judges wereremoved from the bench for political and racial reasons. Periodicletters were sent by the Ministry of Justice to all Reich judgesand public prosecutors, instructing them as to the results they mustaccomplish. Both the bench and bar were continually spied upon by theGestapo and SD, and were directed to keep disposition of their casespolitically acceptable. Judges, prosecutors and, in many cases, defensecounsel were reduced in effect to an administrative arm of the NaziParty.                         COUNT TWO--WAR CRIMES8. Between September 1939 and April 1945 all of the defendantsherein unlawfully, willfully, and knowingly committed war crimes, asdefined by Control Council Law No. 10, in that they were principalsin, accessories to, ordered, abetted, took a consenting part in, andwere connected with plans and enterprises involving the commissionof atrocities and offenses against persons and property, including,but not limited to, plunder of private property, murder, torture,and illegal imprisonment of, and brutalities, atrocities, and otherinhumane acts against thousands of persons. These crimes included,but were not limited to, the facts set out in paragraphs 9 to 19,inclusive, of this indictment, and were committed against civilians ofoccupied territories and members of the armed forces of nations thenat war with the German Reich and who were in the custody of the GermanReich in the exercise of belligerent control.9. Extraordinary irregular courts, superimposed upon the regular courtsystem, were used by all of the defendants for the purpose of and infact creating a reign of terror to suppress political opposition to theNazi regime. This was accomplished principally through the PeoplesCourt (Volksgerichtshof) and various Special Courts (Sondergerichte),which subjected civilians of the occupied countries to criminalabuse of judicial and penal process including repeated trials on thesame charges, criminal abuse of discretion, unwarranted impositionof the death penalty, prearrangement of sentences between judgesand prosecutors, discriminatory trial processes, and other criminalpractices, all of which resulted in murders, cruelties, tortures,atrocities, plunder of private property, and other inhumane acts.10. Special Courts subjected Jews of all nationalities, Poles,Ukrainians, Russians, and other nationals of the Occupied EasternTerritories, indiscriminately classed as gypsies, to discriminatoryand special penal laws and trials, and denied them all semblance ofjudicial process. These persons who had been arbitrarily designatedasocial by conspiracy and agreement between the Ministry of Justiceand the SS were turned over by the Ministry of Justice, both duringand after service of prison sentences, to the SS to be worked todeath. Many such persons were given a summary travesty of trial beforeextraordinary courts, and after serving the sentences imposed uponthem, were turned over to the Gestapo for protective custody inconcentration camps. Jews discharged from prison were turned overto the Gestapo for final detention in Auschwitz, Lublin, and otherconcentration camps. The above-described proceedings resulted in themurder, torture, and ill-treatment of thousands of such persons. Thedefendants von Ammon, Engert, Klemm, Schlegelberger, Mettgenberg,Rothenberger, and Westphal are charged with special responsibility forand participation in these crimes.11. The German criminal laws, through a series of expansions andperversions by the Ministry of Justice, finally embraced passivedefeatism, petty misdemeanors and trivial private utterances astreasonable for the purpose of exterminating Jews or other nationalsof the occupied countries. Indictments, trials and convictions weretransparent devices for a system of murderous extermination, anddeath became the routine penalty. Jurisdiction of the German criminalcode was extended to the entire world, to cover acts of non-Germansas well as Germans living outside the Reich. Non-German nationalswere convicted of and executed for high treason allegedly committedagainst the Reich. The above-described proceedings resulted inthe murder, torture, unlawful imprisonment, and ill-treatment ofthousands of persons. The defendants Barnickel, Cuhorst, Klemm, Lautz,Mettgenberg, Nebelung, Oeschey, Petersen, Rothaug, Rothenberger,Schlegelberger, and Westphal are charged with special responsibilityfor and participation in these crimes.12. The Justice Ministry aided and implemented the unlawful annexationand occupation of Czechoslovakia, Poland, and France. SpecialCourts were created to facilitate the extermination of Poles andJews and the suppression of political opposition generally by theemployment of summary procedures and the enforcement of Draconicpenal laws. Sentences were limited to death or transfer to the SS forextermination. The Peoples Court and Special Courts were projectedinto these countries, irregular prejudicial regulations and procedureswere invoked without notice (even in violation of the Reich CriminalCode as unlawfully extended to other occupied territories), sentenceswere prearranged, and trial and execution followed service of theindictment within a few hours. The above-described proceedings resultedin the murder, ill-treatment, and unlawful imprisonment of thousands ofpersons. The defendants Klemm, Lautz, Mettgenberg, Schlegelberger, andWestphal are charged with special responsibility for and participationin these crimes.13. The Ministry of Justice participated with the OKW and the Gestapoin the execution of Hitlers decree of Night and Fog (Nacht undNebel) whereby civilians of occupied territories who had been accusedof crimes of resistance against occupying forces were spirited awayfor secret trial by certain Special Courts of the Justice Ministrywithin the Reich, in the course of which the victims whereabouts,trial, and subsequent disposition were kept completely secret, thusserving the dual purpose of terrorizing the victims relatives andassociates and barring recourse to any evidence, witnesses, or counselfor defense. The accused was not informed of the disposition of hiscase, and in almost every instance those who were acquitted or who hadserved their sentences were handed over by the Justice Ministry tothe Gestapo for protective custody for the duration of the war. Inthe course of the above-described proceedings, thousands of personswere murdered, tortured, ill-treated, and illegally imprisoned. Thedefendants Altstoetter, von Ammon, Engert, Joel, Klemm, Mettgenberg,and Schlegelberger are charged with special responsibility for andparticipation in these crimes.14. Hundreds of non-German nationals imprisoned in penal institutionsoperated by the Reich Ministry of Justice were unlawfully executedand murdered. Death sentences were executed in the absence of thenecessary official orders, and while clemency pleas were pending. Manywho were not sentenced to death were executed. In the face of Alliedmilitary advances so-called inferior or asocial prison inmateswere, by Ministry order, executed regardless of sentences under whichthey served. In many instances these penal institutions were operatedin a manner indistinguishable from concentration camps. The defendantsEngert, Joel, Klemm, Lautz, Mettgenberg, Rothenberger, and Westphalare charged with special responsibility for and participation in thesecrimes.15. The Ministry of Justice participated in the Nazi program ofracial purity pursuant to which sterilization and castration lawswere perverted for the extermination of Jews, asocials, andcertain nationals of the occupied territories. In the course of theprogram thousands of Jews were sterilized. Insane, aged, and sicknationals of occupied territories, the so-called useless eaters,were systematically murdered. In the course of the above-describedproceedings thousands of persons were murdered and ill-treated. Thedefendants Lautz, Schlegelberger, and Westphal are charged with specialresponsibility for and participation in these crimes.16. The Ministry of Justice granted immunity to and amnesty followingprosecutions and convictions of Nazi Party members for major crimescommitted against civilians of occupied territories. Pardons weregranted to members of the Party who had been sentenced for provedoffenses. On the other hand, discriminatory measures against Jews,Poles, gypsies, and other designated asocials resulted in harshpenal measures and death sentences, deprivation of rights to fileprivate suits and rights of appeal, denial of right to receive amnestyand to file clemency pleas, denial of right of counsel, imposition ofspecial criminal laws permitting the death penalty for all crimes andmisdemeanors, and finally, in the transfer to the Gestapo for specialtreatment of all cases in which Jews were involved. The defendants vonAmmon, Joel, Klemm, Rothenberger, and Schlegelberger are charged withspecial responsibility for and participation in these crimes.17. By decrees signed by the Reich Minister of Justice and others, thecitizenship of all Jews in Bohemia and Moravia was forfeited upon theirchange of residence by deportation or otherwise; and upon their lossof citizenship their properties were automatically confiscated by theReich. There were discriminatory changes in the family and inheritancelaws by which Jewish property was forfeited at death to the Reichwith no compensation to the Jewish heirs. The defendants Altstoetterand Schlegelberger are charged with special responsibility for andparticipation in these crimes.18. The Ministry of Justice through suspension and quashing ofcriminal process, participated in Hitlers program of inciting theGerman civilian population to murder Allied airmen forced down withinthe Reich. The defendants Klemm and Lautz are charged with specialresponsibility for and participation in these crimes.19. The said war crimes constitute violations of internationalconventions, particularly of Articles 47, 23, 43, 45, 46, and 50of the Hague Regulations, 1907, and of articles 2, 3, and 4 of thePrisoner of War Convention (Geneva, 1929), the laws and customs ofwar, the general principles of criminal law as derived from thecriminal laws of all civilized nations, the internal penal laws of thecountries in which such crimes were committed, and of Article II ofControl Council Law No. 10.

See pp. 1526.]       *       *       *       *       *       *       *PRESIDING JUDGE MARSHALL: The microphone will now be placed infront of the defendant Josef Altstoetter.I shall now call upon all defendants to plead guilty or not guilty tothe charges against them.

SCHILF: I wish to make a request. I wish to ask theprosecution, in due time before the opening of the trial, to make theirdocument books available to the defendants and to their counsel.We make the following objections against the indictment: Ordinance No.7, by the Military Government, says, in article IV under paragraph(_a_), that the indictment is to set forth the counts simply,distinctly, and in sufficient detail, and that the defendants should beinstructed on the details of the charges made against them.The defendants, or rather the two clients I represent, failed to findcertain details in the indictment. With the exception of possiblythe charge in regard to the Night and Fog Decree, no legal decree isreferred to which could possibly be considered illegal.In that manner the preparation by the defendants is frustrated becausethe indictment, according to our opinion, is conceived much toogenerally, and the requirements of article IV of Ordinance No. 7 justreferred to by me are not fulfilled. This could be remedied in that theprosecution, in due time, before the opening of the trial, makes thedocument books available to the defense counsel.That is what I should like to ask for on behalf of my two clients.PRESIDING JUDGE MARSHALL: Does the prosecution desire to makeany comment at this time upon the point raised?MR. LAFOLLETTE: Unfortunately, and it is no fault of thedefendants counsel, I didnt hear what was coming through the phones.As I understand two points were raised--the fact that no documents werefiled with defendants counsel in their room. Those will be furnished.Secondly, with reference to the objection raised to the indictment, Ibelieve the rules require the objections should be reduced to writing.In any event I think it would serve the purpose if the objection tothe indictment was reduced to writing, and then Your Honors would picksuch time as you see fit to dispose of the motion, and we can argue itat that time more intelligently than we could at this moment. I do notdesire to take advantage of technicalities, but I hope the record willnote that defense counsel have duly raised the objection, and at suchtime as it is to be disposed of it will be reduced to writing beforeit is disposed of. I think it only reasonable that it be reduced towriting.PRESIDING JUDGE MARSHALL: The defendants counsel will berequired to reduce certain matters to writing, as requested by theprosecution, and it is possible that we will want to dispose of thatmatter between now and 5 March if it is agreeable to counsel on bothsides.DR. KOESSL: I have already submitted the same request inwriting.MR. LAFOLLETTE: If that has been submitted in writing I thinkYour Honors have indicated we may, within a reasonable time after youhave seen it, wish to dispose of that prior to 5 March, or on 5 March,whichever Your Honors shall see fit. That will be satisfactory to us.PRESIDING JUDGE MARSHALL: I suggest, in that connection, afteryou have seen the written matter that you advise the Tribunal when weare not in session as to your wishes.MR. LAFOLLETTE: I shall be glad to do that, Judge. I assume wewill wait and take not only the objections on behalf of the defendantRothaug, but also any objections which have been filed by counsel onbehalf of any other defendants. After they have been submitted andI have had an opportunity to see them, I will confer with defensecounsel, and perhaps after that we will have time to confer with theCourt as to the time of disposition.PRESIDING JUDGE MARSHALL: Are there any other counselrepresenting defendants who desire to present any matters at this time?If not, the order for recess will stand.   (The Tribunal adjourned until 0930 hours, 5 March 1947.)                        III. OPENING STATEMENTS              A. Opening Statement for the Prosecution[9]BRIGADIER GENERAL TAYLOR: This case is unusual in that thedefendants are charged with crimes committed in the name of the law.These men, together with their deceased or fugitive colleagues, werethe embodiment of what passed for justice in the Third Reich.Most of the defendants have served, at various times, as judges, asstate prosecutors, and as officials of the Reich Ministry of Justice.All but one are professional jurists; they are well accustomed tocourts and courtrooms, though their present role may be new to them.But a court is far more than a courtroom; it is a process and a spirit.It is the house of law. This the defendants know, or must have knownin times past. I doubt that they ever forgot it. Indeed, the root ofthe accusation here is that those men, leaders of the German judicialsystem, consciously and deliberately suppressed the law, engagedin an unholy masquerade of brutish tyranny disguised as justice,and converted the German judicial system to an engine of despotism,conquest, pillage, and slaughter.The methods by which these crimes were committed may be novel insome respects, but the crimes themselves are not. They are as old asmankind, and their names are murder, torture, plunder, and othersequally familiar. The victims of these crimes are countless, andinclude nationals of practically every country in Europe.But because these crimes were committed in the guise of legal process,it is important at the outset to set forth certain things that are not,here and now, charged as crimes.The defendants and their colleagues distorted, perverted, and finallyaccomplished the complete overthrow of justice and law in Germany.They made the system of courts an integral part of dictatorship.They established and operated special tribunals obedient only to thepolitical dictates of the Hitler regime. They abolished all semblanceof judicial independence. They brow-beat, bullied, and deniedfundamental rights to those who came before the courts. The trialsthey conducted became horrible farces, with vestigial remnants of legalprocedure which only served to mock the hapless victims.This conduct was dishonor to their profession. Many of these misdeedsmay well be crimes. But, in and of themselves, they are not charged ascrimes in this indictment. The evidence which proves this course ofconduct will, indeed, be laid before the Court, as it constitutes animportant part of the proof of the crimes which are charged. But thedefendants are not now called to account for violating constitutionalguaranties or withholding due process of law.On the contrary, the defendants are accused of participation in andresponsibility for the killings, tortures, and other atrocities whichresulted from, and which the defendants know were an inevitableconsequence of, the conduct of their offices as judges, prosecutors,and ministry officials. These men share with all the leaders of theThird Reich--diplomats, generals, party officials, industrialists, andothers--responsibility for the holocaust of death and misery whichthe Third Reich visited on the world and on Germany herself. In thisresponsibility, the share of the German men of law is not the least.They can no more escape that responsibility by virtue of their judicialrobes than the general by his uniform.One other word of clarification. Some of the evidence in this case willrelate to acts which occurred before the outbreak of war in 1939. Theseacts will be proved in order to show that the defendants were part of aconspiracy and plan to commit the crimes charged to have been committedafter the outbreak of war, and to show that the defendants fullyunderstood and intended the criminal consequences of their acts duringthe war. But none of these acts is charged as an independent offense inthis particular indictment.The charges in the indictment have been so limited for purposes ofclarity and simplicity. There is no need to test in this case delicatequestions concerning the criminality per se of judicial misconductsince the accusation and the evidence cut much deeper. The defendantsare charged with using their offices and exercising their powers withthe knowledge and intent that their official acts would result in thekilling, torture, and imprisonment of thousands of persons in violationof international law as declared in Control Council Law No. 10. Nor isthere any need to inquire here into what acts committed before the warare cognizable as crimes against humanity under Law No. 10, since thebulk of the proof relates to acts which occurred during the war.In summary, the defendants are charged with judicial murder and otheratrocities which they committed by destroying law and justice inGermany, and by then utilizing the emptied forms of legal process forpersecution, enslavement, and extermination on a vast scale. It is thepurpose of this proceeding to hear these charges and to render judgmentaccording to the evidence under law.The true purposes of this proceeding, therefore, are broader than themere visiting of retribution on a few men for the death and sufferingof many thousands. I have said that the defendants know, or shouldknow, that a court is the house of law. But it is, I fear, many yearssince any of the defendants have dwelt therein. Great as was theircrime against those who died or suffered at their hands, their crimeagainst Germany was even more shameful. They defiled the German templeof justice, and delivered Germany into the dictatorship of the ThirdReich, with all its methods of terror, and its cynical and open denialof the rule of law.[10]The temple must be reconsecrated. This cannot be done in the twinklingof an eye or by any mere ritual. It cannot be done in any singleproceeding or at any one place. It certainly cannot be done atNuernberg alone. But we have here, I think, a special opportunity andgrave responsibility to help achieve this goal. We have here the menwho played a leading part in the destruction of law in Germany. Theyare about to be judged in accordance with the law. It is more thanfitting that these men be judged under that which they, as jurists,denied to others. Judgment under law is the only just fate for thedefendants; the prosecution asks no other.                      THE GERMAN JUDICIAL SYSTEMThere are fifteen defendants in the box, all of whom held high judicialoffice, and all but one of whom are trained lawyers. To understand thiscase, it is necessary to understand the general structure of the Germanjudicial system and the places occupied by the several defendantswithin that system.To assist the Court in this regard, the prosecution has prepared ashort expository brief which is already in the hands of the Court andwhich has been made available to defense counsel in German and English.The brief includes a glossary of the more frequent German words orexpressions which will occur during the trial--most of them from thevocabulary of governmental and judicial affairs. It includes a table ofequivalent ranks between the American Army and the German Army and SS,and a table of the civilian ranks used in the German judicial system.It also includes two charts, showing respectively the structure of theReich Ministry of Justice, and the hierarchy of German courts.[11]Finally, it includes a copy of the composite chart now displayedon the wall of the courtroom, which shows the positions occupied bythe defendants in the general scheme of things. This chart has beencertified by the defendant Schlegelberger, and will be introduced as anexhibit in this case when Mr. LaFollette commences the presentation ofevidence. It is being displayed at this time as a convenient guide tothe Court and to defense counsel, to enable them more easily to followthe opening statement.                  JUDICIAL ORGANIZATION PRIOR TO 1933Because Germany was divided into a multitude of states and provincesuntil modern times, German law is not the product of a continuous oruniform development. However, while some elements of old Germanic lawhave survived, German law has for many centuries been based primarilyon the principles of Roman law. As is the case in most continentalnations, German law today is enacted to a substantial degree in theform of codes.Even at the present time, the principal source of German criminallaw is the Criminal Code of 1871. Amendments have been frequent, butit has never been completely overhauled. For our present purpose,it is sufficient to note the codes threefold division of criminaloffenses. Serious crimes, punishable with death or imprisonment formore than 5 years, are called crimes (Verbrechen); lesser offenses,punishable with imprisonment or substantial fines, are calleddelicts (Vergehen); and minor offenses are called contraventions(Uebertretungen).Questions of criminal procedure are regulated by the Code of CriminalProcedure of February, 1877; matters of jurisdiction and of courtorganization are prescribed in the General Judicature Act of January,1877.Under both the German Empire and the Weimar Republic, the authority toappoint judges and prosecutors and the power to execute sentences werejealously guarded prerogatives of the individual German states. TheReich Ministry of Justice, therefore, remained predominantly a ministryof federal legislation. The anomaly of a highly unified federal law, ascontrasted with a court system administered by the individual states,endured until after the advent of Hitler.In spite of the fact that the authority for supervision and appointmentof judges rested with the numerous states, the German court systemwas well organized and highly unified before Hitler came to power.The basis of the court system was the local courts (Amtsgerichte), ofwhich there were over 2,000, which had original jurisdiction over minorcivil suits and over the less serious criminal offenses (delicts andcontraventions). Original jurisdiction in the more important civiland criminal cases was exercised by the district courts (Landgerichte),of which there were some 180.The principal appellate courts in Germany were called the districtcourts of appeal (Oberlandesgerichte). Of those there were 26, orgenerally one to each state and province.[12] The district courts ofappeal entertained civil appeals from all decisions of the local anddistrict courts, and second criminal appeals from cases originallyheard in the local courts. The president of the district court ofappeals (Oberlandesgerichtspraesident) was also the administrative headof all the courts in his district.The Supreme Court of the Reich (Reichsgericht) in Leipzig formed theapex of the judicial pyramid. It determined important legal questionsinvolving the interpretation of Reich laws, and entertained appealsfrom the decisions of the district courts of appeal and from criminalcases originally heard in the district courts. It was also the court offirst and last instance for important treason cases.The judges of the Reich Supreme Court were appointed by the Presidentof the Reich. The judges of the lower courts were appointed by therespective state governments. Before the advent of national socialism,a judge could not be removed by the government, but only by formalaction before a disciplinary court composed of his peers. This securityof tenure was guaranteed by articles 102 and 104 of the Weimarconstitution.               JUDICIAL ORGANIZATION OF THE THIRD REICHThe impact of Hitlers seizure of power on the German judicial systemwas swift and drastic. The Enabling Law of 24 March 1933 authorizedthe executive to issue decrees with the force of law and provided thatthese decree laws could deviate from the Weimar constitution, thecivil rights provision of which had already been suspended by a decreeof 28 February 1933. For practical purposes, therefore, legislative andexecutive powers were merged in Hitlers cabinet, and the constitutionwas robbed of all practical effect.In 1934, the administration of justice was taken entirely out ofthe hands of the German states and was concentrated exclusively inthe government of the Reich. The first law for the transfer of theadministration of justice to the Reich was proclaimed 16 February 1934;it provided that thereafter all courts should pronounce judgment inthe name of the German people, vested in the President of the Reichall clemency powers formerly held by the states, and authorized theReich Minister of Justice to issue regulations for the transfer of theadministration of justice to the Reich. This general directive was putinto execution by the second and third laws for the transfer of theadministration of justice to the Reich, promulgated in December 1934and January 1935, respectively. The Justice Ministries of the severalstates were thereby abolished, and all their functions and powers wereconcentrated in the Reich Ministry of Justice, which became the supremejudicial authority, under Hitler, in the Reich. Hitler had alreadyproclaimed himself the Supreme Law Lord of the German people in hisspeech to the Reichstag defending the killings which occurred duringthe suppression of the Roehm putsch.[13]1. _The Reich Ministry of Justice_ (_Reichsjustizministerium_)--Thecentralization of the German administration of justice brought about,of course, a great increase in the scope and functions of the ReichMinistry of Justice. Its more important divisions are shown in thecomposite chart on the wall of the courtroom; a more detailed chart ofthe Ministry alone is included in the expository brief.For the first 8 years of the Hitler regime, the Minister of Justice wasFranz Guertner, who had taken this office under the von Papen cabinetand retained it until his death in January 1941. Under Guertner, thetwo principal officials were the defendant Schlegelberger and RolandFreisler, each with the title of under secretary. Schlegelbergertook charge of the Ministry from Guertners death until August 1942,but throughout that period he was Acting Minister and was neverofficially given cabinet rank. In August 1942, Dr. Georg Thierack,then president of the Peoples Court, was appointed Reich Minister andSchlegelberger was retired. Freisler succeeded Thierack as president ofthe Peoples Court.Under Thierack, there was only one under secretary. Thierack firstappointed the defendant Rothenberger, but in January 1944 Rothenbergerwas put on the retired list and replaced by the defendant Klemm.Besides the defendants Schlegelberger, Rothenberger, and Klemm, fourof the other defendants held high office in the Ministry of Justice,and still others served in the Ministry at various times during theircareers. The defendant Klemm, as well as being the under secretary,headed Division II of the Ministry, which concerned itself with legaleducation and training. The defendants von Ammon and Mettgenberg, aswell as the deceased Westphal, were officials of Divisions III andIV, which were ultimately merged, and which governed virtually allquestions of criminal legislation and procedure, and prosecutions.The defendant Altstoetter headed Division VI, which dealt with civillaw and procedure. The defendant Engert, after having served on thePeoples Court, became the head of Division V, Penal Institutions, andof Division XV, first created in 1942 and dissolved in 1944. DivisionXV concerned itself with the secret transfer of certain classes ofpersons from ordinary prisons to the Gestapo. The Ministry of Justicecontrolled a variety of other judicial institutions, including variousSpecial Courts and the examining office for candidates for admissionand qualification of judges and lawyers. It controlled the Academy forGerman Law and various other associations of attorneys, as well as aspecial training camp for the Nazi indoctrination of young attorneys.Most important of all, it supervised and administered the entire courtsystem from the Reich Supreme Court clear down to the local courts.This function included the assignment, transfer, and promotion of alljudges.2. _The Hierarchy of regular courts_--The centralization of judicialadministration in the Reich Ministry of Justice did not at first haveany pronounced effect upon the structure of the regular court system.The established hierarchy of courts--local courts, district courts,district courts of appeal, and the Reich Supreme Court--continued ineffect. The most important development in the early years of the ThirdReich was the creation of extraordinary and special courts, whichincreasingly cut into the jurisdiction of the regular courts.Under the impact of war, however, the system of regular courts wassubstantially altered, although its general outlines remained the same.These alterations were intended for economy and expedition, and toreduce the number of judicial personnel. This was accomplished chieflyin two ways: by reduction in the number of judges required to hearparticular kinds of cases, and by drastic curtailment of the right ofappeal.Many of these changes were made at the outbreak of war in 1939.Thereafter, all cases in the local courts and all civil cases in thedistrict courts were heard by one judge only; criminal cases in thedistrict courts were heard by three judges, but the president of thecourt could hear such cases alone if the issues were simple. Criminalcases heard by the local courts could be appealed only as far asthe district courts; civil cases heard in the local courts could beappealed directly to the district court of appeals, bypassing thedistrict court.Further drastic curtailments of the right of appeal occurred in 1944and 1945. In general, appeals could only be taken by permission of thecourt which heard the case, and permission was granted only to settlelegal questions of fundamental importance. The judicial functions ofthe district courts of appeal were almost, if not entirely, eliminated,although their supervisory administrative functions continued.3. _Extraordinary courts_--The most crucial and radical change in thejudicial system under the Third Reich, however, was the establishmentof various extraordinary courts. These irregular tribunals permeatedthe entire judicial structure, and eventually took over all judicialbusiness which touched political issues or related to the war.Within a matter of weeks after the seizure of power, by a decree of 21March 1933, Special Courts (Sondergerichte) were established. OneSpecial Court was set up within the district of each district court ofappeal. Each court was composed of three judges drawn from the judgesof the particular district. They were given jurisdiction over offensesdescribed in the emergency decree of 28 February 1933, which includedinciting to disobedience of government orders, crimes in the nature ofsabotage, and acts contrary to the public welfare. There were drasticprovisions for the expedition of proceedings before the special courts,and no appeal whatsoever lay from their decisions.A few weeks later, special military courts, which had been abolishedby the Weimar constitution, were reestablished and given jurisdictionover all offenses committed by members of the armed forces. In July1933, special Hereditary Health Courts more generally known asSterilization Courts were established at the seats of the localcourts, with special appellate Hereditary Health Courts above them.But the most notorious Nazi judicial innovation was the so-calledPeoples Court (Volksgerichtshof), established by the decree of 24April 1934, after the Reich Supreme Courts acquittal of the defendantsin the Reichstag fire trial. The Peoples Court replaced the SupremeCourt as the court of first and last instance for most treason cases.The Peoples Court sat in divisions, or senates, of five memberseach. Two of the five had to be qualified judges; the other threewere trusted Nazi laymen selected from high ranking officers of theWehrmacht (armed forces) and SS, or from the Party hierarchy. Theywere appointed for 5-year terms by Hitler, on the recommendation ofthe Minister of Justice. Six senates were established, each of whichheard cases from a particular geographical section of Germany. In1940 a special senate was established to retry cases where, in thejudgment of the chief public prosecutor of the Reich, an inadequatepunishment had been imposed.As time went on, the concept of treason was much enlarged by avariety of Nazi decrees, and both the Special Courts and the PeoplesCourt were given jurisdiction to try a great variety of offenses.In 1936, for example, the smuggling of property out of Germany wasproclaimed an offense against the national economy, and the PeoplesCourt was given jurisdiction over such cases. In 1940, a new decreedefined the jurisdiction of the Special Courts and Peoples Court, andall sorts of offenses, such as evasion of conscription and listening toforeign broadcasting stations, were brought within their purview.Toward the end of the war, by a decree of February 1945, emergencycivil courts martial (Standgerichte) were set up in areas menaced bythe approaching enemy. Each consisted of three members appointed bythe Reich Defense Commissar, usually the Gauleiter (regional leader) ofthe district; the president was a professional judge, who sat with oneassociate judge from the Nazi Party, and one from the Wehrmacht or SS.These courts martial could only condemn the accused to death, acquithim, or transfer the case to a regular tribunal.Thierack was president of the Peoples Court prior to his appointmentas Reich Minister of Justice. He was then succeeded by Freisler, theformer under secretary of the Ministry of Justice, who remained aspresident until nearly the end of the war, when he was killed in an airraid. The defendant Engert was vice president of the Peoples Courtprior to his transfer to the Ministry of Justice in 1942. The defendantNebelung was president of the Fourth Senate of the Peoples Court.The defendant Petersen, the only nonlawyer in the dock, was an SAObergruppenfuehrer (lieutenant general) who sat as a lay judge on manyoccasions in the First and Special Senates of the Peoples Court.Three of the defendants were judges of the Special Courts. Thedefendant Cuhorst was president of the Special Court in Stuttgart, andthe defendant Rothaug was president of the Special Court in Nuernberg.The defendant Oeschey also sat on the Special Court in Nuernberg andsucceeded Rothaug as its president when the latter became a publicprosecutor. Oeschey was also president of the emergency civil courtmartial at Nuernberg.4. _Public prosecutors_--The prosecution of criminal offenses, underthe Third Reich, was handled by a special group of state attorneys(Staatsanwaltschaft) directed by the Ministry of Justice. Increasinglyunder the Third Reich there was interchange of personnel among judgesand prosecutors.The defendant Rothaug, for example, left the bench of the SpecialCourt at Nuernberg to become a senior public prosecutor of the Reich(Reichsanwalt). The defendant Barnickel also held this title. Thedefendant Joel, in 1943, left the Ministry of Justice and became thepublic prosecutor of the district court of appeals for Westphalia, atHamm.The most important prosecutor among these defendants, however, wasErnst Lautz, Chief Public Prosecutor of the Reich (Oberreichsanwalt).In this capacity, Lautz prosecuted many important cases before thePeoples Court.                               COUNT ONE             THE DESTRUCTION OF LAW AND JUSTICE IN GERMANYI turn now to an examination of the means by which the defendants andtheir colleagues seized control of Germanys judicial machinery andturned it into a fearsome weapon for the commission of the crimescharged in the indictment.The destruction of law in Germany was, of course, part and parcelof the establishment of the Third Reich dictatorship. Initially,the dictatorship arose out of the decrees in the early part of 1933which suspended the constitutional guaranties of freedom and vestedHitlers cabinet with legislative power, unrestrained by constitutionallimitations. These early decrees put an end to law as we know it in ademocracy.But much more had to be accomplished in order to achieve a dictatorshipof the proportions envisaged by the authors of the Third Reich. Freedomof the ballot had to be suppressed so that a false veneer of electoralapproval could be spread over the Nazi edifice. The civil service hadto be purged of dissident officials. An ubiquitous and ruthless policesystem had to be created. A multitude of other measures were necessary.But, above all, law and justice had to be utterly stamped out.At first blush, the reason for this may not appear. The Nazi cabinetcould decree any law it wanted to with the flourish of a pen. Thecourts, unless they were bold enough to deny the very basis of Hitlersauthority, which they did not do, were bound to punish violations ofthese laws. Was this not enough for even Hitlers purposes?The answer is twofold. Particularly in the early years of the ThirdReich, Hitlers government pursued aims and employed methods whichit did not, at that time, see fit to authorize by formal, publiclegislation. The regime was not yet strong enough, externally orinternally, to face the storm of disapproval which such legislationwould have encountered. The Nazi government thought it wise to pursuethese aims and employ these methods outside of, and often in violationof, the letter and spirit of the law. And it did not wish to beembarrassed or obstructed by an independent judiciary respectful onlyto the law. The outcome of the Reichstag fire trial, for example, washighly embarrassing and promptly bore sinister fruit in the creation ofthe Peoples Court.But there was another and much more fundamental reason. The ideology ofthe Third Reich was totally incompatible with the spirit of the law. Itcould not live under law, and the law could not live under it. To takebut one example: even under stringent anti-Jewish legislation, therewere bound to be situations where an overgreedy German in a civil suitor an overzealous police official in a criminal case had erroneouslyhaled a Jew into court. In other words, even under Nazi legislation,there were bound to be cases when the Jew was legally right. Yet, itwas unthinkable that a German court should exalt the Jew and discreditthe German with a decision in favor of the Jew. Such perplexingproblems could be dealt with only by courts which were not true courtsat all, and which could be trusted to suppress the law and to render anideological judgment or, as was done later, to declare the Jew to be ananimal beyond the judicial pale entirely, who could not, any more thana wrongfully beaten dog, ask judicial intervention or protection.This sort of problem was far more delicate in the case of the Poles,whom the Nazis chose to regard as less than human but more than Jewish.Later on in this case, we will, I think, derive some macabre humorfrom the documentary spectacle which some of these defendants madeof themselves in vainly wrestling with the insoluble problem of howto achieve a certain amount of legal order and stability in occupiedPoland, without at the same time giving the Poles any true law on whichthey could rely.In short, the very idea of law was inimical to the ideology of theThird Reich, and it is not surprising that its principal authorsrecognized this fact at a very early date. In 1930, Hitler himselfdeclared with reference to a court decision against certain Nazis--   We can assure the judges that, if national socialism assumes   power, they will be fired without any pension.[14]Joseph Goebbels expressed the same thought even more bluntly in 1934after the Nazis were in power--   We were not legal in order to be legal, but in order to rise to   power. We rose to power legally in order to gain the possibility   of acting illegally.[15]Later on in this case, the Tribunal will have offered to it documentswhich speak at length about the creation of a new, National Socialistsystem of law. By then, it will be apparent, I believe, that aNational Socialist system of law is a preposterous contradictionin terms. It never was an objective of the Third Reich to create anysystem of law. On the contrary, it was its fundamental purpose totear down every vestige of law in Germany, and to replace it witha mere bureaucracy which would mete out reward and punishment inaccordance with the tyrannical ideology and tactical necessities of thedictatorship. The one-time sage of Nazi jurisprudence, the late Dr.Hans Frank, summed this up aptly in 1935 (_NG-777, Pros. Ex. 19_)--   National socialism is the point of departure, the content, and   the goal of the legal policies of the Third Reich.[16]And the defendant Schlegelberger expressed the same thought in 1936(_NG-538, Pros. Ex. 21_)--   Accordingly there can be no doubt that now the moral order and   ideology [Weltanschauung], as recognized in the Party program,   has to be taken into consideration in the interpretation and   application of every norm of the existing law.[17]We may now retrace some of the steps which the law lords of theThird Reich took to turn the judicial system into a subservient buteffective agent of the regime. Some of these we have already noted.The centralization of the administration of justice in the Reichgovernment, the vesting of over-all authority in the Reich Ministryof Justice, and the creation of extraordinary courts were essentialsteps in the process. Standing alone, these acts might have beenunobjectionable, though the creation of special courts was expresslyprohibited by article 105 of the Weimar constitution. But these firstmoves were but the prelude to a series of deadly thrusts at the vitalsof the judicial system. The early history of this organized attackon the fundamentals of law is summarized in the decision of theInternational Military Tribunal--   Similarly, the judiciary was subjected to control. Judges were   removed from the bench for political or racial reasons. They   were spied upon and made subject to the strongest pressure   to join the Nazi Party as an alternative to being dismissed.   When the Supreme Court acquitted three of the four defendants   charged with complicity in the Reichstag fire, its jurisdiction   in cases of treason was thereafter taken over and given to a   newly established Peoples Court consisting of two judges   and five officials of the Party. Special Courts were set up to   try political crimes and only Party members were appointed as   judges. Persons were arrested by the SS for political reasons,   and detained in prisons and concentration camps; and the judges   were without power to intervene in any way. Pardons were granted   to members of the Party who had been sentenced by the judges for   proved offenses. In 1935, several officials of the Hohenstein   concentration camp were convicted of inflicting brutal treatment   upon the inmates. High Nazi officials tried to influence the   court, and after the officials had been convicted, Hitler   pardoned them all. In 1942, judges letters were sent out to   all German judges by the government, instructing them as to the   general lines that they must follow.[18]The destruction of the judicial process continued throughout the eraof the Third Reich. The period from the beginning of the new regime in1933 until the outbreak of the war was characterized by the rise ofspecial tribunals, and the steady decrease of procedural guaranties.After 1939, the war accelerated the conversion of criminal justiceinto dictatorial administrative procedure until, at the end of thewar, all resemblance to legal process had vanished. We turn now to anexamination of the particular steps in the process.                             a. 19331939Immediately after the seizure of power, the Nazis struck hard at theindependence and integrity of the judiciary by dismissing or demotingpolitically unreliable judges and officials of the Ministry of Justice.The temporary decree of 7 April 1933, under which this was done,provided that--   Officials, whose former political activity does not offer a   guarantee that they, at all times without reservation, act   in the interest of the national state, can be dismissed from   service. For a period of 3 months after dismissal, they are   accorded their former salary. From this time on, they receive   three-fourths of their pension and corresponding survivors   benefits.[19]In 1937 similar language was embodied in permanent legislation in theCivil Service Act.[20] The result of these measures was the eliminationof all Jews and part-Jews, Social Democrats, and other opponents ofthe Nazi regime, from the bench and from the staff of the Ministry ofJustice.Substantive criminal law during this period was radically affected bythe introduction of the authoritarian ideology of the Third Reich,and the concept of the criminal as the enemy of the nation. The primepurpose of the new criminal provisions was to make the new holders ofpower secure against all competition or attack. The decree for theprotection of the German people[21] initiated a never-ending stream oflegislation intended to protect the persons, institutions, and symbolsof the Third Reich against all attacks of political enemies. The fieldfor the application of treason and high treason was vastly enlarged byinvesting the most preparatory and auxiliary acts with the characterof treason. The range of application of the death penalty, in the pastrestricted to murder and some cases of homicide, was greatly widened.Hand in hand with the sharpening of penalties and the extension of thescope of punishable atrocities went the attempt to widen the scope ofGerman criminal jurisdiction beyond its territorial limits. The newrace defilement prohibitions for example were made applicable tooffenses committed abroad.[22]Examples of such draconic and tyrannical decrees are legion. The decreeof 24 April 1934 provided that the death penalty, or hard labor forlife, or hard labor for 2 years or more, should be inflicted--   1. If the act aimed at establishing or maintaining an organized   combination for the preparation of high treason; or   2. If the act was directed toward making the armed forces or   police unfit for the execution of their duty to protect the   stability of the German Reich from internal or external attacks;   or   3. If the act was directed toward influencing the masses by   making or distributing writings, recordings, and pictures, or by   the installation of wireless, telegraph, or telephone; or   4. If the act was committed abroad or was committed in such   a manner that the perpetrator undertook to import writings,   recordings, or pictures from abroad for the purpose of   distribution within the country.By August 1938, this tendency had progressed to a point where thefollowing acts were all made punishable by death:   1. Whoever openly solicits or incites others to evade the   fulfillment of compulsory military service in the German or an   allied armed force, or otherwise openly seeks to paralyze or   undermine the will of the German people or an allied nation to   self-assertion by bearing arms;   2. Whoever undertakes to induce a soldier or conscriptee in   the reserves to disobedience, opposition, or violence against   a superior, or to desertion or illegal absence or otherwise to   undermine the discipline of the German or an allied military   force; and   3. Whoever undertakes to cause himself or another to avoid   the fulfillment of military service entirely, or to a limited   extent, or temporarily, by means of self-mutilation, or by means   designed to deceive or by other methods.[23]But the Nazi jurists were not content to sharpen the letter of thepenal laws; they subverted the spirit and method of interpretation ofthe criminal law in order to enable the courts to impose punishment,outside the law, in accordance with the political ideology of theregime. Thus, in June 1935, article 2 of the penal code was amended toread as follows:   Whoever commits an act which the law declares as punishable   or which deserves punishment according to the fundamental idea   of a penal law or the sound sentiment of the people, shall be   punished. If no specific penal law can be directly applied to   this act, then it shall be punished according to the law whose   underlying spirit can be most readily applied to the act.[24]At the same time, the following articles were added to the code ofcriminal procedure:   Article 170a--If an act deserves punishment according to the   sound sentiment of the people, but is not declared punishable   in the code, the prosecution must investigate whether the   underlying principle of a penal law can be applied to the act   and whether justice can be helped to triumph by the proper   application of this penal law.   Article 267a--If the main proceedings show that the defendant   committed an act which deserves punishment according to the   sound sentiment of the people, but which is not declared   punishable by the law, then the court must investigate whether   the underlying principle of a penal law applies to this act   and whether justice can be helped to triumph by the proper   application of this penal law.[25]And, simultaneously, the Reich Supreme Court was ordered to set asideits prior decisions in order to bring the law into conformance with theideology of the Third Reich. The decree is as follows:   The Reich Supreme Court, as the highest German tribunal,   must consider it its duty to effect an interpretation of the   law which takes into account the change of ideology and of   legal concepts which the new State has brought about. In order   to be able to accomplish this task without having to show   consideration for the decisions of the past brought about by   other ideology and other legal concepts, it is ruled as follows:   When a decision is made about a legal question, the Reich   Supreme Court can deviate from a decision laid down before this   law went into effect.This tyrannical doctrine of punishment by analogy was given a sugarcoating by Dr. Hans Frank (_NG-777, Pros. Ex. 19_):   In the future, criminal behavior, even if it does not fall   under formal penal precepts, will receive the deserved   punishment if such behavior is considered punishable according   to the sound sentiment of the people.[26]But once again, Josef Goebbels was shameless enough to state thedoctrine with complete frankness (_NG-417, Pros. Ex. 23_):   While making his decisions the judge is to proceed less from   the law than from the basic idea that the offender is to be   eliminated from the community. During a war it is not so much   a matter of whether a judgment is just or unjust, but only the   decision is expedient. The State must protect itself in the most   efficient way and wipe them out entirely * * *. One must not   proceed from the law, but from the resolution that the man must   be wiped out.[27]On the administrative side, the prewar years were characterized by evercloser collaboration between Himmlers Gestapo and the Reich Ministryof Justice. In February 1937, Himmler directed that all Gestapo mattersbe made available to the district public prosecutors. The next month,the Reich Minister of Justice (Guertner) addressed a letter to all thedistrict public prosecutors, calling attention to Himmlers directiveand stating (_NG-323, Pros. Ex. 32_):   In order to have this decree fulfill its purpose and in the   interest of the closest possible collaboration between the   office of the public prosecutor and the authorities of the   Gestapo, I hereby issue this supplementary order that in   future, public prosecutors routinely address all requests for   investigations to be conducted on the basis of reports of   political nature received by them directly, to the local and   district police authorities _via the competent state police   offices_. When in cases based on such reports, the necessary   interrogations of the accused or the witnesses are procured by   the court itself or by the expert of the prosecution, and the   police authorities are not at all involved in the proceedings,   I request that the state police offices be informed of the   proceedings as soon as possible.[28]The German jurists, who collaborated so closely with Himmlers minions,were equally willing to protect overzealous Nazis against thepenal consequences of their worst excesses. Late in 1933 a group ofStorm Troopers (SA) committed vicious assaults and tortures on somepolitical prisoners who had been confined in the concentration camp ofKemna, near Wuppertal in the Ruhr. The description of this outrage bythe Reich Minister of Justice reads as follows:   In the camp, some of the prisoners were exposed to the severest   mishandling.   In most cases, shortly after their shipment had come in, and   when they were being interrogated, they would be beaten, partly   upon their bare bodies, with rubber cudgels, horsewhips, sticks,   ox lashes, and other objects. In many cases they had to lie   down over a special caning bench, or were forced down onto it   by guards, and their mouths were kept shut or they were gagged   with balls of paper, pieces of cloth, bags, or similar things,   in order to prevent them from screaming. Other members of the   guard in the meantime would begin to beat them up. Prisoners who   fainted were kicked back to consciousness or had water thrown   over them to wake them up and make them stand up again. After   this, prisoners who were mistreated were frequently locked up in   a small space under the stairway or in an elevator without being   given any medical attention or food and drink. In some cases,   the injuries the prisoners received from their beatings made it   necessary to transfer them to hospitals.   Several prisoners also were forced to eat unwashed herrings   from the barrel, which had also been sprinkled with salt * * *.   When they had finished the herrings, the prisoners, who were   naturally suffering from tormenting thirst, were not allowed to   have water brought them.Proceedings against the storm troop leaders in a disciplinary tribunalof the Nazi Party ended in a mere reprimand and deprivation of theright to hold public office for 1 year. The files of the Ministry ofJustice concerning this atrocious episode contain the recommendationsof various officials, including the defendant Joel, that criminalproceedings against the perpetrators should be cancelled. Thisrecommendation was adopted and forwarded to Hitler by MinisterGuertner, who, for justification, pointed to the circumstances thatthe culprits were not experienced concentration camp guards, that themajority of the victims were Communists, that, in some cases, thevictims had been obstinate and insubordinate, and that communism had anespecially strong hold in the Wuppertal area.                             b. 19391945Before the outbreak of war, the main objective of Nazi penalinnovations was to suppress internal opposition to the new regime, andto render life intolerable for the Jews. During the early years ofthe war, the Nazi jurists were largely concerned with legal problemsincident to the occupation of Poland, France, and the other nationsoverrun by the Wehrmacht. The extension of German law to the occupiedareas, and the outrages committed thereunder, constituted war crimesand crimes against humanity on a grand scale, which will be describedin due course. German criminal law was also applied extensively to actscommitted outside the Reich, even when committed by foreigners.[29]Acts committed by a foreigner outside the Reich could even constitutetreason against the Reich.But the war also brought a mass of new criminal legislation withinGermany. This new legislation was influenced by the necessities of war,but also contained matured concepts of National Socialist criminalpolicy. The principal aim was to guarantee the security of the Naziregime, and bolster the economic and military strength of Germany,through extremely harsh criminal punishments. The chief weapon was theunsparing and almost indiscriminate use of capital punishment.Later on, as Germanys military situation worsened, the death penaltybecame an ordinary sentence for a great variety of offenses. Theincreased severity of air raids resulted in capital punishment orlong prison sentences for crimes committed during black-outs, evenvery minor looting. Economic hardship and shortages of materials wereaccompanied by laws prescribing penal servitude, or even death, foranyone who destroyed or removed food or other supplies. Toward theend of the war, a desperate attempt was made to cope with the growingdefeatism by imposing the death penalty for spreading rumors, listeningto foreign broadcasts and even for the most minor derogatory remarksabout the Hitler regime or pessimism concerning Germanys chances ofmilitary success.The war brought new and extraordinary procedures, as well as newcrimes. Despite all that had been done in prewar years, the courts werestill handing down some sentences which, in the eyes of Berlin, weretoo mild, and once such a final judgment had been given, nothing couldbe done about it. The whole idea of the finality of judgments had longbeen a thorn in the flesh of the Nazi jurists. Accordingly, 2 weeksafter the outbreak of war, a decree[30] was promulgated which providedthat, if the Chief Reich Prosecutor had serious misgivings concerningthe justice of a sentence, he could, within 1 year thereafter, filean extraordinary appeal and secure a second trial of the case. Theofficials of the Reich Ministry of Justice, who controlled the publicprosecutors, reviewed the criminal decisions and directed the chiefprosecutor to file appeals in cases where they deemed the punishmentinsufficient. If the first decision had been rendered by the regularcourts, the second trial was held by the Special Penal Senate ofthe Reich Supreme Court. If the first decision had been made by thePeoples Court, on the other hand, the second trial was held by theSpecial Senate of the Peoples Court.In 1940, an analogous procedure was authorized[31] under which theChief Public Prosecutor of the Reich could lodge with the Supreme Courta petition for nullification against final judgments of the regularcriminal courts or the Special Courts if the judgment is not justifiedbecause of an erroneous application of law on the established facts.The Supreme Court was authorized either to render a new judgment orto send the case back to a lower court for a new trial under bindinginstructions as to the legal principles which should govern. Notcontent with this elaborate system for punitive double jeopardy, theright of the Chief Public Prosecutor to attack final judgments by meansof the nullification procedure was again enlarged in 1942, by extensionto questions of law and to the adequacy of the punishment.[32] Thisnew regulation provided the prosecution, but not the defense, withan unlimited right to ask for a new trial within one year after thedecision had been rendered.On the day of the attack on Poland, a new assault on the tenure andindependence of the judiciary was made.[33] By this new decree, judgeswere obliged to take any assignment whatsoever, as judge, prosecutor,or administrative official, and on any regular or Special Court,according to the orders of the Reich Minister of Justice. Similarpowers were given to the presidents of the district courts of appealwithin their respective districts.It might have been thought that, after the purge of Jewish andpolitically dissident judges in 1933, the permanent subjection ofthe judiciary to dismissal for political reasons in 1937, and theircomplete subordination to the Reich Ministry of Justice in 1939, Hitlerwould have at last obtained a suitable judiciary for his most extremepurposes. Apparently, however, pre-Hitler legal training sometimes hadthe unfortunate effect that even trusted Nazi judges failed in theirdecisions to measure up to the ideology and expectations of the ThirdReich. At all events, something like a crisis in the German judicialsystem occurred in 1942.On 26 April 1942 Hitler made a speech before the Reichstag in which hereviewed the effects of the hard winter of 19411942 and exhorted theGerman people to even greater sacrifices in order to achieve victory.In the course of this speech, Hitler made certain remarks about theGerman legal profession and the administration of justice which hadan immediate and pronounced effect. Hitler said (_NG-752, Pros. Ex.24_):   I do expect one thing: that the nation gives me the right to   intervene immediately and to take action myself wherever a   person has failed to render unqualified obedience and service in   the performance of the greater task which is a matter of to be   or not to be. The front and the homeland, the transport system,   administration, and justice must obey only one idea, that of   achieving victory. In times like the present, no one can insist   on his established rights, but everyone must know that today   there are only duties.   I therefore ask the German Reichstag to confirm expressly that   I have the legal right to keep everybody to his duty and to   cashier or remove from office or position, without regard for   his person or his established rights, whoever, in my view and   according to my considered opinion, has failed to do his duty.          *       *       *       *       *       *       *   Furthermore, I expect the German legal profession to understand   that the nation is not here for them, but that they are here for   the nation; that is, the world, which includes Germany, must   not decline in order that formal law may live, but that Germany   must live, irrespective of the contradictions of formal justice.   To quote one example, I fail to understand why a criminal who   married in 1937, ill-treated his wife until she became insane   and finally died as a result of the last act of ill-treatment,   should be sentenced to 5 years in a penitentiary at a moment   when tens of thousands of honorable German men must die to save   the homeland from annihilation at the hands of bolshevism.   From now on, I shall intervene in these cases and remove from   office those judges who evidently do not understand the demand   of the hour.[34]Immediately after Hitlers speech, the Reichstag adopted the followingresolutions:   There can be no doubt in this present state of war, when the   German nation wages its fight for its very existence, that   the Fuehrer must exercise the right, which he claims, to do   everything which serves or helps to achieve victory. Therefore,   the Fuehrer, by his authority as the leader of the nation,   supreme commander of the armed forces, head of the government,   and in supreme possession of all executive power, as supreme   law lord, and as leader of the Party, has to be in a position   to enforce, with all means which he may consider suitable,   every Germans duties, whether he might be a common soldier or   an officer, a subordinate or high civil servant or a judge, a   leading or subordinate functionary of the Party, a worker or an   employee. In case of violations of duties, he has the right to   impose the proper penance, after a conscientious examination   of the case. This can be done without consideration for the   so-called civil service rights. In particular, he may remove   anyone from his office, rank and his position, without resort to   the established procedures.[35]This menacing blast from the Fuehrer, and the resolution of theReichstag, wiped away the last remains of judicial independence inGermany. Furthermore, within a few months a complete reorganization ofthe upper levels of the Ministry of Justice took place. Schlegelberger,who had seen the storm coming and made desperate efforts to meetHitlers wishes, was nevertheless retired and replaced by Thierack.A special Hitler decree in August 1942 gave the new Reich Ministersweeping powers to bring the administration of justice into conformitywith the needs of the regime; it read:   A strong administration of justice is necessary for the   fulfillment of the tasks of the Greater German Reich. Therefore,   I commission and empower the Reich Minister of Justice to   establish a National Socialist Administration of Justice, and   to take all necessary measures in accordance with the Reich   Minister and Chief of the Reich Chancellery and the Leader of   the Party Chancellery. He can hereby deviate from any existing   law.[36]At the same time, Roland Freisler left the Justice Ministry to becomepresident of the Peoples Court, and the defendant Rothenbergertook Freislers old job as under secretary. Earlier in the year,Rothenberger, previously president of the district court of appeals atHamburg, had attracted the Fuehrers attention by submitting to him along thesis on judicial reform. This thesis is a curious document;it speaks at length of the honor and dignity of the judges functionand of the need for justice as the foundation of the Third Reich, butthe reason it won the Fuehrers approval can perhaps be more clearlyinferred from the two following quotations (_NG-075, Pros. Ex.27_):   The present crisis in the administration of justice today   is close to such a climax. A totally new conception of the   administration of justice must be created, particularly a   National Socialist judiciary, and for this the druggists salve   is not sufficient; only the knife of the surgeon, as will later   be shown, can bring about the solution.   The criterion, however, for the functions of justice, and   particularly of the judge in the National Socialist Reich, must   be a justice which meets the demands of national socialism.   He who is striding gigantically toward a new world order   cannot move in the limitation of an orderly administration   of justice. To accomplish such a far-reaching revolution in   domestic and foreign policy is only possible if, on the one   hand, all outmoded institutions, concepts, and habits have been   done away with--if need be, in a brutal manner--and if, on the   other hand, institutions that are in themselves necessary but   are not directly instrumental in the achievement of a great goal   and which, in fact, impede it, are temporarily thrust to the   background. All clamor about lawlessness, despotism, injustice,   etc., is at present nothing but a lack of insight into the   political situation * * *.At the time he was appointed Minister, Thierack also became thepresident of the German Academy of Law, and of the National SocialistAssociation of Jurists. The temper of the new administration of justicewas reflected in Thieracks announcement to the German Academy of Lawas follows:   The formulation of law is not a matter of science and a goal   in itself, but rather a matter of political leadership and   organization. Therefore, the activities of the Academy relating   to the formulation of law must be coordinated with the aims of   political leadership.[37]At the time of their appointments, Thierack and Rothenberger envisagedan ambitious program for simplifying the hierarchy of German courts,drastically reducing the number of judges, and modernizing theeducation and training of judges in accordance with prevailingpolitical thought. Much of this program was never realized, butThierack and Rothenberger did succeed in developing new devices fordirect control of judicial decisions by the government. This has beenalso foreshadowed in Rothenbergers thesis submitted to Hitler:   * * * a judge who is in direct relation of fealty to the   Fuehrer must judge like the Fuehrer. In order to guarantee   this, a direct liaison officer without any intermediate agency   must be established between the Fuehrer and the German judge,   that is, also in the form of a judge, the supreme judge in   Germany, the Judge of the Fuehrer. He is to convey to the   German judge the will of the Fuehrer by authentic explanation of   the laws and regulations. At the same time he must, upon the   request of the judge, give binding information in current trials   concerning fundamental political, economic, or legal problems   which cannot be surveyed by the individual judge.In part, this executive control was accomplished by conferences betweenthe prosecutors and the judges, in which the prosecutor advised thejudge what measure of sentence the Ministry of Justice thought fittingin a particular case. But an even more effective device was a seriesof confidential circulars to the judges known as Judges Letters(Richterbriefe) which Thierack dispatched, under his own signatureas Minister of Justice, to the judges and prosecutors throughout theGerman judicial system. Thierack announced this forthcoming series inSeptember 1942 in the following letter:   To aid the judge in fulfilling his high duty in the life of our   people, I decided to publish the Judges Letters. They shall be   distributed to all German judges and prosecutors. These Judges   Letters will contain decisions that seem to be especially   worthwhile mentioning, on account of result or argumentation.   On these decisions, I will show how a better decision might   or should have been found; on the other hand, good, and for   the national community, important decisions shall be cited as   examples.   The Judges Letters are not meant to create a new casuistry,   which would lead to a further ossification of the administration   of justice and to a guardianship over the judges. They will   rather tell how judicial authorities think National Socialist   justice should be applied and thereby give the judge the inner   security and freedom to come to the right decision.   The contents of these letters are confidential; the chief of an   office shall keep them, and let every judge and prosecutor take   notice of them against receipt.   For the publication of the Judges Letters, the collaboration   of all the judges and prosecutors is needed. I expect that   suitable decisions from all branches of justice will be   presented to me. On publication, neither the judge nor the   deciding court will be named.   I am convinced that the Judges Letters will help to influence   the administration of justice uniformly according to National   Socialist doctrines.The first letter was published on 1 October 1942. In a sort ofhortatory prelude, many thoughts and ideas from the Rothenberger thesiswere embodied. Thereafter, a number of criminal cases and the sentencestherein imposed were set forth and commented upon.Four cases dealing with crimes committed during black-outs weredescribed; those decisions in which the death penalty had been imposedwere approved, the others were all criticized for being too mild. Sixcases dealing with sex offenses followed; the sentences in five ofthem were condemned as utterly inadequate. No case was cited where thesentence was thought too severe.At the end of the letter, three cases dealing with Jews were discussedin great detail. One of these dealt with the racial law which requiredall Jews to adopt the surname Sarah or Israel according to theirsex. A Jewish woman had neglected to apply to the telephone company tochange her listing by the addition of the name Sarah. The districtcourt sentenced her to a fine of thirty reichsmarks, or 19 days inprison. The court set forth in its opinion that certain other courtshad construed the law as not requiring an application to change atelephone listing, and that the Jewess might have relied on thesedecisions. Thieracks letter described the Jewess action as typicalJewish camouflage in her business dealings and stated that the lackof uniformity in the decisions in no way justified leniency in thepunishment.In the second case, a special coffee ration had been distributed in acertain town, in the autumn of 1940. A large number of Jews had appliedto receive the ration. However, since Jews were automatically excludedfrom the distribution, they did not receive any coffee. The followingyear, the food authorities imposed a fine on the Jews for the offenseof having applied for the coffee; thereupon several hundred Jews soughtrelief against the fine in the district court. The judge rescinded thefine on the basis of the statute of limitations and for other legalreasons, and expressed the opinion that the Jews had not committed anypunishable act in merely applying for the coffee. On this decision,the Reich Ministers letter commented as follows (_NG-298, Pros. Ex.81_):   The ruling of the local court, in form and content, borders on   embarrassing a German administrative authority to the advantage   of Jewry. The judge should have asked himself the question: What   is the reaction of the Jew to this 20-page-long ruling, which   certifies that he and the 500 other Jews are right and that he   won over a German authority, and does not devote one word to the   reaction of our own people to this insolent and arrogant conduct   of the Jews. Even if the judge was convinced that the food   office had arrived at a wrong judgment of the legal position,   and if he could not make up his mind to wait with his decision   until the question, if necessary, was clarified by the higher   authorities, he should have chosen a form for his ruling which,   under any circumstances, avoided harming the prestige of the   food office and thus putting the Jew expressly in the right   toward it.In the third case, a wealthy young Jew had committed certain violationsof the German foreign currency regulations. The district court,although it found certain extenuating circumstances, imposed a heavyfine on the Jew and sentenced him to 2 years imprisonment. Thisdecision particularly provoked the Reich Minister of Justice, who said(_NG-298, Pros. Ex. 81_):   The court applies the same criteria for the award of punishment   as it would if it were dealing with a German fellow citizen as   defendant. This cannot be sanctioned. The Jew is the enemy of   the German people, who has plotted, stirred up, and prolonged   this war. In doing so, he has brought unspeakable misery upon   our people. Not only is he of a different, but he is also of an   inferior race. Justice, which must not measure different matters   by the same standard, demands that just this racial aspect   must be considered in the award of punishment. Here, where a   profiteering transaction typical of the defendant as a Jew, and   to the disadvantage of the German people, had to be judged, the   verdict, in awarding punishment, must take into consideration in   the first place that the defendant for years had deprived the   German people of considerable assets. * * * This typical Jewish   parasitical attitude required the most severe judgment and   heaviest punishment.Beginning with this issue in October 1942, the Judges Letters wereissued regularly and continued to be filled with exhortations to theutmost ruthlessness in the imposition of sentences. Later on, theywere supplemented by Lawyers Letters (Rechtsanwaltbriefe). As timewent on, German criminal law and procedure scarcely retained any otherelements than that of threatening wavering elements of the populationinto submission. The wholesale destruction of legal process culminatedat the very end of the war in the creation of the emergency civiliancourts martial, which have already been mentioned. These courts martialwere given jurisdiction for all kinds of crimes endangering the Germanfighting power or undermining the peoples defensive strength[38]and, if they found the defendant guilty, could impose only the deathsentence. The end of the war cut short the life of these tribunals,after ten weeks of judicial terrorism.Throughout the war, the administrative and penal branches of theMinistry of Justice continued to cooperate in protecting loyalfollowers of the Third Reich from criminal prosecution for theirinnumerable atrocities against Poles, Jews, and other undesirableelements. At the successful conclusion of the Polish campaign,an unpublished decree suspended all prosecutions against racialGermans in Poland for any punishable offenses which they mighthave committed against Poles during the Polish war due to angeraroused by the cruelties committed by the Poles. In 1941, thedefendant Schlegelberger assured Rudolf Hess that he would considerbenevolently an amnesty in any particular case of atrocitiescommitted after the conclusion of the Polish campaign. An example ofthis benevolent consideration may be worth noting. Two Germans,one of whom was a sergeant of police, shot two Polish priests inPoland in the spring of 1940 for no reason other than hatred for theCatholic clergy. A Special Court imposed 15 years penal servitude formanslaughter. After 2 years of the sentence had been served, Himmlerasked that the Germans be pardoned, and that it be made possible forthem to win their reprieve through service at the front. At Himmlersrequest, the Ministry of Justice reduced the sentence to 5 years, andboth men were released from confinement and assigned to duty in aWaffen SS [armed SS] unit.After the advent of Thierack and Rothenberger, cooperation between theMinistry of Justice and Himmlers police became even closer. On 18September 1942 Thierack and Rothenberger held a long conference withHimmler and other high ranking SS leaders at Hitlers headquarters.Thieracks notes of the meeting included the following (_654-PS,Pros. Ex. 39_):   1. Correction by special treatment at the hands of the police   in cases where judicial sentences are not severe enough. On the   suggestion of Reichsleiter Bormann, the following agreement was   reached between the Reich Leader SS, and myself:   _a._ In principle, the Fuehrers time is no longer to be   burdened with these matters.   _b._ The Reich Minister of Justice will decide whether   and when special treatment at the hands of the police is to be   applied.   _c._ The Reich Leader SS will send the reports, which he   sent hitherto to Reichsleiter Bormann, to the Reich Minister of   Justice.   _d._ If the views of the Reich Leader SS and those of the   Reich Minister of Justice agree, the final decision on the case   will rest with them.   _e._ If their views are not in agreement, Reichsleiter   Bormann will be asked for his opinion, and he will possibly   inform the Fuehrer.   _f._ In cases where the Fuehrers decision on a mild   sentence is sought through other channels (such as by a letter   from a Gauleiter) Reichsleiter Bormann will forward the report   to the Reich Minister of Justice. The case will then be decided   as already described by the Reich Leader SS and the Reich   Minister of Justice.   2. Delivery of antisocial elements from the execution of   their sentences to the Reich Leader SS to be worked to death.   Persons under security detention--Jews, gypsies, Russians,   and Ukrainians, Poles with more than 3-year sentences; Czechs   and Germans with more than 8-year sentences--will be turned   over without exception according to the decision of the Reich   Minister of Justice. First of all, the worst antisocial elements   among those just mentioned are to be handed over. I shall inform   the Fuehrer of this through Reichsleiter Bormann.          *       *       *       *       *      *       *   14. It is agreed that, in consideration of the intended aims   of the government for the clearing up of the eastern problems,   in future Jews, Poles, gypsies, Russians, and Ukrainians are no   longer to be tried by the ordinary courts, so far as punishable   offenses are concerned, but are to be dealt with by the Reich   Leader SS. This does not apply to civil lawsuits, nor to Poles   whose names are registered for, or entered in the German Racial   Lists.[39]We said at the outset that the defendants and their colleaguesaccomplished the complete overthrow of justice and law in Germany. Theforegoing recital of the steps in this process and the proof to beintroduced will, we think, make this abundantly clear. The Third Reichbecame a realm of despotism, death, and finally, of despair.But the very perversion and brutality of the Nazi penal system maylead us to think of it as aimless cruelty, which it is not. Fanatical,ruthless, and even unbalanced as the German leaders might have been,they were never purposeless. Law and justice were destroyed for areason. They were destroyed because by their very nature they stoodathwart the path of conquest, destruction, and extermination which thelords of the Third Reich were determined to follow. The Nazi SpecialCourts, double jeopardy, the flouting of the letter and the spirit ofthe law--those things were not ends in themselves. They were methodsdeliberately adopted for the purpose of causing death, torture, andenslavement. Now that we have traced the steps in the conspiracy, it istimely that we examine the murders and other atrocities which were itsintended and actual outcome.                         COUNTS TWO AND THREE                WAR CRIMES AND CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITYTwo facts stand out when we study the crimes charged in thisindictment. First, the diabolical novelty presented by the designeduse of a nations system of justice and its machinery by the governingpower of that nation, as a weapon of destruction--an instrumentality ofmurder, kidnapping, slavery, torture, brutality, and larceny. Second,the mass character, and therefore the enormity of the crimes committedby these defendants with this new weapon--this headmans axe fashionedfrom the scales of justice in a forge, stoked with national greed andracial bigotry and hatred, fanned by blasts of directed propaganda andshaped by the calculated blows of designedly infamous legislation,controlled and dominated courts, and a studied effort to makeineffective or to eliminate completely, the defensive aids customarilyenjoyed by defendants in the courts of civilized nations.These facts in turn have the definite effect of confusing and dullingthe minds of lawyers and laymen alike, so that they do not clearlyunderstand either the right and the power of this Tribunal to try thesedefendants under international law or the simple standards by whichtheir crimes can be measured and judged.It follows, therefore, that we should now pause at the threshold ofthis trial to make clear the authority under and by which we act, andthe time honored standards under which we shall assert and prove theguilt of these defendants.A concise review of recent history will be helpful and therefore proper.On 30 October 1943 Prime Minister Churchill, Premier Stalin, andPresident Roosevelt issued their Moscow Declaration. That part which ispertinent to an understanding of what we do here reads as follows:   The above Declaration is without prejudice to the case of the   major criminals whose offenses have no particular geographical   localization and who will be punished by the joint decision of   the Governments of the Allies.[40]It is clear that those criminals whose offenses have no particulargeographical localization, are to be punished, not necessarily tried,by the joint decision, not necessarily a joint or internationaltribunal, of the Allies. The basic policy to punish is thus clearlylaid down.Thereafter, the same three powers met at Potsdam after theunconditional surrender of Germany. At this meeting representativesof the French nation also participated. There agreements andunderstandings relative to the future policies to be pursued by thosegovernments toward Germany and war criminals were reached. Two of themshould be recalled, because they throw light upon the stature andthe international character of this Tribunal and also of the purposebehind the definition of the crimes for the commission of which thesedefendants have been indicted and are being tried.In the statement released at Potsdam on 2 August 1945, they said:   The three governments have taken note of the discussions which   have been proceeding in recent weeks in London * * * with the   view to reaching agreement on the methods of trial of those   major war criminals whose crimes under the Moscow Declaration of   October 1943 have no particular geographical localization, * * *   they regard it as a matter of great importance that the trial of   those major criminals shall begin at the earliest possible date.We thus see that the three powers have now advanced from their thinkingat Moscow, in that they have determined the method by which thesecriminals are to be punished. But the method of trial is still to bethe result of the joint decision of the powers who signed the MoscowDeclaration, concurred in by the representatives of the French nation.The decision to try by judicial proceeding came six days later atLondon.But another significant decision was reached at Potsdam. Thepowers concerned reached agreement on The Political and EconomicPrinciples to Govern the Treatment of Germany in the Initial ControlPeriod. Among these we find the following which are pertinent to anunderstanding of what we do here.                       A. Political Principles   1. In accordance with the agreement, * * * supreme authority   in Germany is exercised, on instructions from their respective   governments, by the commanders-in-chief of the armed forces (of   the governments concerned) each in his own zone of occupation   and also jointly, in matters affecting Germany as a whole, in   their capacity as member of the Control Council.   2. So far as practicable, there shall be uniformity of   treatment of the German population throughout Germany.   3. The purposes of the occupation of Germany by which the   Control Council shall be guided are:          *       *       *       *       *      *      *   (III) To destroy the National Socialist Party and its   affiliated and supervised organizations, to dissolve all Nazi   institutions, to insure they are not revived in any form, * * *.   (IV) To prepare for the eventual reconstruction of German   political life on a democratic basis and for eventual peaceful   cooperation in international life in Germany.On 8 August 1945 the powers which were represented at Potsdam, throughtheir equally accredited representatives, brought forth at London anagreement which in its preamble refers to major war criminals, andin article I, to war criminals. The agreement also contemplated anInternational Military Tribunal for the trial of such criminals and fora charter to define the constitution, jurisdiction, and functions ofthat Tribunal, which charter was in fact made a part of said agreementon the same day. Two things deserve our attention at this point. Thecharter defined crimes and thus fixed an objective standard by whichwar criminals were to be identified. The adjective major wasthereupon immediately relegated to the role of superficial invectiveor at most to that of fixing a comparative standard of criminalimportance, measured solely by the judgment of the committee of chiefprosecutors or the practical and mechanical necessities of the actualtrial. The crimes of most of these defendants are so great that if theychoose, they may consider themselves slighted by the committee of chiefprosecutors. The prosecution in this case shall do its ethical best tosee that they were not fortunate.On 20 December 1945, the same three Allied Powers which had issued theMoscow Declaration, and the same four Powers which had reached thePotsdam Agreements and entered into the London Agreement and createdthe Charter of the International Military Tribunal, also enacted LawNo. 10 of the Control Council for Germany.Law No. 10 provided for this Tribunal and the method by which it wasthereafter to be brought into existence; defined the crimes over whichit exercises jurisdiction, and adequately described the persons it hadjurisdiction to try and punish and the punishment it was authorized toimpose. The preamble clearly discloses that Law No. 10 was enacted andtherefore this Court was created to accomplish two purposes, first--   In order to give effect to the terms of the Moscow Declaration   of 30 October 1943 and the London Agreement of 8 August 1945 and   the Charter issued pursuant thereto,and second,   In order to establish a _uniform legal basis_ in Germany   for the prosecution of war criminals and other similar   offenders, other than those dealt with by the International   Military Tribunal.Although this preamble does not expressly say so, it is clear that thesecond purpose is to implement the Potsdam Agreement, which requireduniform treatment of the German population throughout Germanyas an inter-allied multipowered policy. The policy was thus madeinter-allied. The method of implementing it was all that was delegatedas a matter of right, not power, to the several contracting nationsacting within their zones of occupation through their zonal commander.This Tribunal therefore is international in its source as well as inits jurisdiction over subject matter and persons.On 30 September and 1 October 1946, approximately 13 months afterthe London Agreement and Charter were created and more than 9 monthsafter Law No. 10 was promulgated, the International Military Tribunalrendered its decision and judgment upon the individual defendants whomit found guilty.After the judgment of the International Military Tribunal on 18October 1946, the Zone Commander of the American Zone, for the purposeof implementing Law No. 10 of the Inter-Allied Control Council forGermany, and to carry out the purposes therein stated and previouslyagreed upon by the four signatory powers at London and Potsdam,promulgated Ordinance No. 7, concerning the organization and powers ofcertain military tribunals. That ordinance brought this Tribunal intoexistence and laid down many of the procedures under which it operates,but it did not restrict nor limit its jurisdiction over persons orsubject matter set out in Law No. 10 nor did it define new crimes.Nothing that has been done since the four Powers adopted the LondonAgreement and Charter has operated to materially limit the jurisdictionover persons and subject matter of this Tribunal from that conferredupon the International Military Tribunal by those internationalinstruments.A study of the charter, Law No. 10 and Ordinance No. 7 discloses thatLaw No. 10, article II, paragraph 5 tolls any and all statutes oflimitations for the period from 30 January 1933 to 1 July 1945. It alsocontains provisions which have the effect of depriving this Tribunalof recognizing as a valid defense in this trial any immunity, pardonor amnesty granted to any of these defendants by the Nazi government.This is a limitation not imposed by the charter upon the InternationalMilitary Tribunal.Likewise, Ordinance No. 7, article X is in no wise a limitation uponthe powers of this Court to determine the guilt or innocence of thesedefendants.[41] It reads as follows:   The determinations of the International Military Tribunal   in the judgments in Case No. 1 that invasions, aggressive   acts, aggressive wars, crimes, atrocities or inhumane acts   were planned or occurred, shall be binding on the tribunals   established hereunder and shall not be questioned except   insofar as the participation therein or knowledge thereof by   any particular person may be concerned. Statements of the   International Military Tribunal in the judgment in Case No.   1 constitute proof of the facts stated, in the absence of   substantial new evidence to the contrary.This provision is couched in language calculated to adequatelysafeguard the rights of defendants, so that, by the same reasoning,it cannot be said to operate as an oppressive rule, which in anymaterial manner unduly restricts this Court in making its own ultimatedetermination as to the guilt or innocence of these defendants. Itis a reasonable rule designed to avoid undue repetitious productionof acknowledged facts in the trial of this cause. As such it doesnot detract from the dignity of this Court nor affect the concurrentnature of the jurisdiction which this Court enjoys in relation to theInternational Military Tribunal.In conclusion, therefore, we take the position that this Tribunal, likethe International Military Tribunal, derives from the joint decisionof the signers of the Moscow Declaration and of the French nation; thatthe subject matter over which it has jurisdiction, the crimes which ithas jurisdiction to try, are codified by the same powers, and that ithas jurisdiction over the same persons, those persons who are chargedby indictment with having committed these crimes. These are the basicelements upon which concurrent jurisdiction as a matter of law hasalways been determined to exist by all courts which have had occasionto decide this question.We have belabored this question of the equal dignity and concurrentjurisdiction of this Tribunal with that of the International MilitaryTribunal for reasons which are legal and also arise from the standpointof policy. To us they seem important and because they do, a due regardfor the candor owed to this Tribunal and to the world obligates us tostate them.MR. LAFOLLETTE: First, we believe that this Tribunalhas the right and power to decide all questions of law, otherthan the criminal nature of those groups or organizations whichthe International Military Tribunal found to be criminal, and asdistinguished from the ultimate facts set out in Ordinance No. 7,article X, as original questions of law which it has the right todecide, contrary to the decisions reached by the International MilitaryTribunal, if it is convinced that a proper interpretation of theCharter and Law No. 10, or of the ultimate facts to be inferred fromthe evidence in this case, require it logically, and therefore, by theexercise of intellectual integrity, to reach a contrary decision. Wedo not deny the persuasive authority of the decision and judgment ofthe International Military Tribunal, but we point out that between theInternational Military Tribunal and this Tribunal the relationship of acourt of superior jurisdiction to that of one of inferior jurisdictiondoes not exist in fact or in law. Therefore the decision and judgmentof the International Military Tribunal is not binding upon this Court;except to the extent fixed by said article X and the other provisionswhich are referred to.Second, from the standpoint of policy the prosecution believes itowes it not only to this Tribunal but to the world to establish theconcurrent jurisdiction and therefore the equal dignity of thisTribunal and of the proceedings before it, with those before theInternational Military Tribunal, which preceded it. We try here warcriminals charged with the commission of international crimes, codifiedas such, by the same nations which codified the crimes for which theInternational Military Tribunal tried the defendants indicted andarraigned before it. This is not an American side show, national incharacter. On the contrary, it is the avowed program of the Governmentof the United States to carry on the obligation assumed at Moscowin 1943 by living up to the inter-Allied agreements made at Potsdamin 1945. Finally, we assert the high character of this Tribunal andtherefore of the proceeding before it, in order that we ourselvesmay understand the high judicial character of our actions and theobligations of candor and ethical conduct which these proceedings ofnecessity impose upon counsel appearing before this bar.We try these defendants, therefore, in a Court whose authoritativesource and whose jurisdiction over subject matter and persons is equalto, and concurrent with, the International Military Tribunal (IMT). Wetry them for crimes, war crimes, and crimes against humanity, whichwere unlawful, as alleged in the indictment, when committed becausethey were in violation of the universal moral judgment of mankindas attested by the judicial decision of the International MilitaryTribunal.We try them in an international court for crimes under internationallaw which finds its authority not in power or force, but in theuniversal moral judgment of mankind.We shall now present our general theory of the prosecutions case. Indoing so, we shall outline the broad legal principles which establishthe relevancy of our evidence to the crimes charged. We shall not, atthis time, except perhaps for the purpose of illustration, relate itto each of these defendants. That will be done adequately enough tosatisfy the Court and disconcert the defendants when we sum up.In count two of this indictment, we charge these defendants withthe commission of war crimes as defined in article II, paragraph1(_b_) of Law No. 10, and in count three we charge them withthe commission of crimes against humanity as defined in Law No. 10,article II, paragraph 1(_c_). We have demonstrated that as we havecharged these crimes in this indictment, we only ask for convictionsfor the same crimes for which the defendants before the IMT weretried; therefore, we adopt basically the following statements from thedecision of the IMT:   With respect to war crimes, however, as has already been   pointed out, the crimes defined by article 6, section (_b_)   of the Charter [which are the same crimes defined by Law No. 10,   article II, paragraph 1(_b_)] were already recognized as   war crimes under international law.[42]Theres a parenthetical statement in there, Your Honors will note.   But it is argued that the Hague Convention does not apply in   this case, because of the general participation clause of   article 2 of the Hague Convention of 1907. * * *.   In the opinion of the Tribunal it is not necessary to decide   this question. The rules of land warfare expressed in the   Convention undoubtedly represented an advance over existing   international law at the time of their adoption. But the   Convention expressly stated that it was an attempt to revise   the general laws and customs of war, which it thus recognized   to be then existing, but by 1939 these rules laid down in the   Convention were recognized by all civilized nations, and were   regarded as being declaratory of the laws and customs of war   which are referred to in Article 6 (_b_) of the Charter.   A further submission was made that Germany was no longer bound   by the Rules of Land Warfare in many of the territories occupied   during the war, because Germany had completely subjugated those   countries and incorporated them into the German Reich, a fact   which gave Germany authority to deal with the occupied countries   as though they were a part of Germany. * * *. The doctrine was   never considered to be applicable so long as there was an army   in the field attempting to restore the occupied countries to   their true owners, and in this case, therefore, the doctrine   could not apply to any territories occupied after 1 September   1939. As to the war crimes committed in Bohemia and Moravia, it   is a sufficient answer that these territories were never added   to the Reich, but a mere protectorate was established over them.   * * * but from the beginning of the war in 1939 war crimes   were committed on a vast scale, which were also crimes against   humanity; and insofar as the inhumane acts charged in the   indictment, and committed after the beginning of the war, did   not constitute war crimes, they were all committed in execution   of, or in connection with, the aggressive war, and therefore   constituted crimes against humanity.[43]It is proper to point out also, that in order to establish the guiltof any of these defendants for crimes against humanity, it is notnecessary that they themselves shall be indicted for or convicted of acrime against peace; that is, the waging of aggressive war, which theIMT held began on 1 September 1939.In the trial before the IMT the record discloses that seven defendantswere convicted of crimes against humanity, who either were not indictedfor, or were found not guilty of, participation in a conspiracy tocommit crimes against peace or of the commission of a crime againstpeace.We want to discuss briefly the substantive law under which we try thiscase.Law No. 10, article II, paragraph 2 is part of the substantive lawunder which this indictment is brought. An effective presentation ofthe meaning and effect of this paragraph is aided by presenting thoseparts of it which are relevant to this case verbatim at this time:   Any person without regard to nationality or the capacity   in which he acted is deemed to have committed a crime as   defined in paragraph 1 of this article, if he was (_a_)   a principal, or (_b_) was an accessory to the commission   of any such crime or ordered or abetted the same or (_c_)   took a consenting part therein or (_d_) was connected with   plans or enterprises involving its commission or (_e_)   was a member of any organization or group connected with the   commission of any such crime or * * *.[44]Clause (_f_) of the above paragraph applies only to crimes againstpeace, for which none of these defendants is indicted.We are not concerned in this opening statement with discussing nicetiesof legal draftsmanship nor shall we now use American legal terminologyto describe the ultimate relationship of defendants, whose guilt isfixed by paragraph 2 of article II to the overt act; namely, any crimeas defined in paragraph 1 of article II. But we are concerned withoffering to this Court our observation upon its legal effect.We do not concern ourselves now with principals or accessories. We dodiscuss the relationships arising out of the words abetted and therelationships set out in clauses (_c_), (_d_), and (_e_), paragraph2 to the overt act. At the threshold, we point out that the crime,which defendants who occupy any of the relationships last referred toare guilty of committing, is _any crime as defined in paragraph 1 ofarticle II_. The proof must show that a crime as defined in Law No. 10,article II, paragraph (1), that is, a crime within the jurisdiction ofthis Tribunal, was committed, but if it was committed by any of thedefendants or a person other than the defendants in the dock or anyof them, and any of these defendants abetted the doing of that act,was connected with a plan or enterprise to commit it, consented to itscommission, or was a member of any organization or group connected withthe commission of any crime within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, heis guilty of committing that crime.The IMT has given two persuasive interpretations of the meaning of thewords being connected with which we cite.In the case of the defendant Streicher who was found guilty ofcommitting crimes against humanity, the IMT said:   Streichers incitement to murder and extermination at the time   when Jews in the East were being killed under the most horrible   conditions clearly constitutes persecution on political and   racial grounds in connection with war crimes, as defined in the   charter, and constitutes a crime against humanity.[45]The case of von Schirach is also most enlightening. Anschluss withAustria took place on 12 March 1938. Von Schirach was appointedGauleiter of Vienna in July 1940. Von Schirach was found guilty ofcommitting crimes against humanity.The IMT said:[46]   As has already been seen, Austria was occupied pursuant to   a common plan of aggression. Its occupation is, therefore, a   crime within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, as that term   is used in article 6 (_c_) of the Charter. As a result,   murder, extermination, enslavement, deportation and other   inhumane acts, and persecutions on political, racial or   religious grounds in connection with this occupation constitute   a crime against humanity under that article.          *       *       *       *       *      *      *   The Tribunal finds that von Schirach, while he did not   originate the policy of deporting Jews from Vienna, participated   in this deportation after he had become Gauleiter of Vienna.   He knew that the best the Jews could hope for was a miserable   existence in the ghettos of the East. Bulletins describing the   Jewish extermination were in his office.[47]It seems clear from these cases that there need be no prearrangementwith, or subsequent request by, the person or persons who actuallycommit the crime and a defendant, to make him guilty as the IMTinterpreted the words being connected with. It would appear to besufficient that the defendant knew that a crime was being committed,and with that knowledge acted in relation to it in any of therelationships set out in paragraph 2 of article II which we haveheretofore been discussing.We think it is also helpful to call to the attention of the Court onerule of evidence by which the existence of a conspiracy, that is, therelationship of individuals to the doing of the overt act, is held tobe established.The case from which we quote arose out of the activities of the KuKlux Klan during the height of its power in Indiana. The people ofthe United States, on that occasion, at least, had enough courage andforesight not to let that organization acquire the control of all ofits judicial system, the way the people of Germany let these defendantsand their fellow Nazis acquire control of and pervert theirs.Consequently, our incipient Nazis were tried. The court in the citedcase held that the proof of the doing of the overt act was in itselfevidence of the intent of the conspirators to commit the act so as toestablish their intent to conspire. I quote from the decision:   True it is, that if the evidence is as consistent with the   innocence of the appellant as with his guilt, no conviction can   be had. It is equally true that overt acts of the parties may be   considered with other evidence and attending circumstances in   determining whether a conspiracy exists, _and where the overt   acts are of the character which are usually, if not necessarily,   done pursuant to a previous scheme and plan, proof of the acts   has a tendency to show such preexisting conspiracy, so that when   proved they may be considered as evidence of the conspiracy   charged_.[48]We point out that proof of murders, enslavement, kidnapping, andmayhem, which are a few of the crimes committed through the device ofa so-called legal and judicial process, are competent evidence thatthe preceding acts which perverted a judicial system into a means forcommitting such crimes were part of a plan and enterprise to make thecommission of those crimes possible.PRESIDING JUDGE MARSHALL: You are not giving the citation ofthe Indiana case?MR. LAFOLLETTE: I beg your pardon, Your Honor. Its a C.C.A.case.PRESIDING JUDGE MARSHALL: What was the page of the Federalsecond?MR. LAFOLLETTE: 365. This mimeograph may not be completelycorrect. I am sure thats right. Otherwise, if that should not becorrect I will advise the Court.The overt acts are evidence under counts two and three of thisindictment not only of the intent with which the preceding acts weredone, but also of the fact that each of those defendants who knewthat the preceding acts were being performed--and it is legallyinconceivable to believe that they did not know--had knowledge of thefact that there was probable danger that the preceding acts wouldresult in the overt crimes or that the preceding acts, being unlawful_eo ipso_ and therefore felonious, would result in the overtacts as the natural consequence of preceding felonious acts. This ismurder--whenever a homicide resulted from the foregoing act. And themurder being an act usually done pursuant to the previous scheme andplans establishes the guilty intent of each and all of the defendantsto commit that murder who stood in any of the relationships to themurder defined in paragraph 2, article II of Law No. 10.We have also said that it is an inevitable result of the murder ofhundreds of thousands and millions of humans that such mass murderdulls our realization that the basic simple principles of the law whichdefine the crime of murder of a single human furnish the standard bywhich was determined the guilt of those who have murdered those humans.A review of these basic rules is therefore proper.In 1877 Mr. Justice Stephen undertook to restate the English common lawof homicide as he then found it. He states that an unlawful homicide,without adequate provocation, was murder, if it followed from an actaccompanied by one of the following states of mind: (1) an intention tocause the death of or grievous bodily harm to any person; (2) knowledgethat the act will probably cause either of the results, even though theactor hopes that they might not occur or is indifferent about them; or(3) an intention to commit a felony or to resist a peace officer in theexecution of his duty.As to the first category, no one can quarrel and there is evidence tosupport the commission of such murders by individual defendants.As to the second category, Mr. Justice Holmes thought that theactors awareness of the danger was immaterial, that the standard wascompletely objective. In Comm. _vs._ Pierce (1884) 138 Mass. 165,page 178, he stated his view succinctly--   When the jury are asked whether a stick of a certain size was a   deadly weapon they are not further asked whether the defendant   knew it was so. /#   In any event, in this case before this Tribunal, we shall ask   the Court to bear in mind that lawyers, by the very nature of   their legal training and experience, knew that the enactment of   _ex post facto_ laws, specially designed racial legislation   and other legislation directly designed to restrict and destroy   the right to make an adequate defense to a criminal charge; the   handpicking of judges and their control by state and party;   the submergence of the courts and prosecutors to the superior   authority of the police; pretrial agreement of judges and   prosecutor on judgment and penalty; unlawful extraterritorial   extension of German law and the issuance of the Nacht und Nebel   [Night and Fog] decree contrary to the laws of war, would   probably cause death of human beings, subjected to such a   perverted judicial system. These defendants are not farmers or   factory workers.   As to the third category, that of homicide resulting from the   intention to commit a felony or while resisting arrest, it is   not amiss to point out that those who are connected with a plan   to extend, or who consent to, or abet the unlawful extension of   German law and German courts into overrun countries contrary to   the laws of war, are doing acts which amount to larceny while   armed or robbery; and that those individuals who commit acts   which abet or are connected with the waging of an aggressive war   or a plan to do so, or who consent thereto, are resisting the   efforts of the peace enforcing nations of the world to arrest   the criminal. The evidence in this case will establish the   unprovocated homicide of countless numbers as the result of the   doing of such acts by these defendants which are clearly felony   murders.   These are but the most apparent applications of the three   categories of murder to the evidence in this case. Time will   not permit our further exemplifying them now. They will be   presented adequately when we summarize the evidence. We do   not wish to be understood by furnishing these few examples   as having exhausted the cases, where the application of the   principles so readily understood when one life is taken by   murderous homicide, to the evidence of this case, will establish   murders and mass murders by these defendants. Furthermore, other   crimes common to the criminal laws of civilized nations, such   as enslavement, kidnapping, or mayhem, have been committed by   these defendants, which can be established by the application   of similar basic principles to the evidence, which should make   the task more simple and at the same time, by reducing the   seeming complexities of mass criminality under international   law to concepts with which the average citizen of a nation is   acquainted, seem to serve the salutary purpose of increasing the   hatred of the average man for war and to warn him of the dangers   inherent in the totalitarian police state, dominated by the   philosophy that the end justifies the means used to attain it.   The crimes charged in count two and in count three fall   generally into several categories.   Substantively, there are first those war crimes which arise   out of the violation of the laws and customs of war, including   section I, articles 47; section II, article 23; section III,   articles 43, 45, 46, and 50 of the Hague Regulations of 1907;   and chapter 6, title I, articles 24 of the Prisoners of War   Convention (Geneva 1929); and the decision and judgment of the   IMT of 30 September and 1 October 1946.   These defendants, in one or more of the relationships set out   in paragraph 2 of article II of Law No. 10, committed numerous   criminal acts as defined in Law No. 10, article II.   These include, as the first substantive group of crimes, the   wrongful extension of German law and German courts into and   over the Eastern Territories and other overrun nations and the   Protectorate, each of which, we contend, was not only an act   done by these defendants in connection with, and in furtherance   of, aggressive war, but also done by them for purely political   reasons which made no pretense of being based upon military   necessity, so that it was _ipso facto_ unlawful or _malum   per se_ and made every act initiated thereafter under such   wrongful extension, as against any of the defendants who are   responsible under Law No. 10, article II, for that wrongful   extension of German law, fall into the category of a felony,   murder, or a criminal enslavement, mayhem, or atrocity; or a   larceny while armed, or a robbery as to plunder of public or   private property.   The other large group in this category of war crimes is the   acts done in connection with the promulgation of the Nacht und   Nebel decree of 7 December 1941 and the acts thereafter done in   carrying out that program.   The second substantive group consists of the crimes arising   out of the activities of the defendants in connection with the   Gestapo, SIPO, SS, and other police groups in which either   under the faade of judicial proceedings or by open violation   of the meager protection afforded the individuals under Nazi   law, Germans and non-Germans were turned over to enslavement and   in many cases to demonstrable certain deaths in concentration   camps, or in prisons where no pretense was made to operate them   other than as concentration camps or human slaughterhouses.   The third group is the cases where, under alleged trials, in the   Peoples Court, Special Courts, and civilian courts martial,   certain of these defendants, by the use of the prescribed   procedures or those actually practiced, the fixing of penalties   which outrage the universal moral judgment of mankind, and   through convictions based only upon the subjective conclusions   of the prosecutor or judge, which we describe now only as   examples, give rise to the legal conclusion that the defendants   thus convicted were murdered or unlawfully enslaved under the   guise of exercising a judicial process.   The Court will get a better understanding of these basic   categories of substantive crimes by the following illustrations   from the evidence, which I will now ask Mr. Douglas King to   first present at this time.       a. Murder Committed in Violation of Articles 43, 46, etc.                        of the Hague Convention   MR. KING: The extension of German law and German courts   into conquered and occupied countries followed as a matter of   course after the victorious German armies had done their work.   In Poland and the Eastern Territories decrees of 4 October 1939   and 6 June 1940 introduced and extended the German jurisprudence   into these countries. It was, however, unthinkable to the Nazi   mind that a Pole should be able to appeal to German law, that he   should have the right to sue a German before a German court in   the capacity of a plaintiff, or to appear against a German in a   case, or even to serve a writ of execution with the assistance   of a bailiff.   To remedy this intolerable situation, the defendant   Schlegelberger drafted a decree which, by its terms, placed   beyond the reach of the Poles and Jews in the Eastern   Territories the last vestige of protection of even the German   law. This decree was made effective on 4 December 1941 and from   time to time was later amended as the need arose. For instance,   approximately a year later, it was amended and made retroactive   for crimes committed prior to 4 December 1941. We think it will   be of interest to the Court to have in Schlegelbergers own   words some of the background of this special treatment for the   Poles and Jews in the Eastern Territories and his own statement   as to the purposes which the decree was intended to accomplish.   This letter was addressed to the Reich Minister and Chief of the   Reich Chancellery (Lammers) and refers to Schlegelbergers draft   of the decree which a few months later was made effective on   Hitlers orders (_NG-144, Pros. Ex. 199_):[49]   On being informed of the Fuehrers intention to discriminate   in the sphere of the penal law between the Poles (and probably   the Jews as well) and the Germans, I prepared, after preliminary   discussions with the presidents of the courts of appeal and   attorneys general of the Eastern Territories, the attached draft   concerning the administration of penal laws against Poles and   Jews in the annexed Eastern Territories and in the territory of   the former Free City of Danzig.   This draft amounts to special legislation both in the sphere   of substantive law and in that of criminal procedure. In this   connection the suggestions made by the Fuehrers deputy have   been taken into consideration to a great extent.In referring to the various provisions of the ordinance, Schlegelbergerhas this to say (_NG-144, Pros. Ex. 199_):   I have been in agreement with the opinion held by the Fuehrers   deputy that a Pole is less sensitive to the imposition of an   ordinary prison sentence; therefore, I have taken administrative   measures to assure that Poles and Jews will be separated from   other prisoners and that their imprisonment will be rendered   more severe * * *.   For these new kinds of punishment the prisoners are to be   lodged in camps--outside of prisons--and are to be employed with   hard and very hard labor. There are also administrative measures   which provide for special disciplinary punishment; that is,   imprisonment in an unlighted cell, transfer from a prison camp   to a more rigorous prison camp, etc.          *       *       *       *       *      *      *   A Pole or a Jew sentenced by a German court is not to be   allowed in the future any legal remedy against the judgment.   Neither will he have a right of appeal or be allowed to ask   that the case be reopened. All sentences will take effect   immediately. In the future Poles and Jews will also no longer be   allowed to object to German judges on the grounds of prejudice   nor will they be able to take an oath. Coercive measures against   them are permissible under easier conditions.          *       *       *       *       *      *      *   In this sphere of criminal procedure the draft clearly shows   the difference in the political status of Germans on one side   and Poles and Jews on the other.          *       *       *       *       *      *      *   Criminal proceedings based on this draft will accordingly be   characterized by the greatest possible speed, together with   immediate execution of sentence and will therefore in no way   be inferior to summary court proceedings. The possibility   of applying the most severe penalties in every appropriate   case will enable the penal law administration to cooperate   energetically in the realization of the Fuehrers political aims   in the Eastern Territories.One of the amendments to this decree, on 3 December 1942 states that noGerman attorney is to undertake the defense of Polish persons beforetribunals in the Incorporated Eastern Territories. This, in effect,prevented any accused person before these courts from having defensecounsel, since Polish lawyers were prohibited from engaging in anylegal practice. That this provision was received favorably by Ministryofficials is indicated by a letter from the president of the courtof appeals in Koenigsberg addressed to the Reich Minister of Justiceshortly after this supplementary decree became effective. The judge, inthe course of his letter, says this:   It is in the German interest to continue to prohibit the   defense of Poles by German jurists * * *.   I see no cause to lift or even to modify the present ban   on defense of Poles by attorneys. On the contrary, the ban   placed on the principle of rendering legal assistance to Poles   by attorneys should be still further stressed and made more   extensive.To put to rest any fear that the ban of German attorneys would resultin a competitive hardship on them, this judge has the following to say:   The fear that, in the future, former Polish attorneys or   counsel may be called in to act as legal advisers to Poles   and may gain influence over them (i.e., German counsel) seems   to me improbable. In the Incorporated Eastern Territories of   my district, where, although the population numbers about one   million, only three attorneys are established, it has not been   observed that former Polish attorneys or counsel are engaging in   activities connected with matters of law.   It is, of course, much easier for the tribunal to have the case   of a person charged put before them by a lawyer nicely arranged   and in the German language. But the judge must dispense with   these facilities when such great issues are at stake for the   German people.The Court will, in due course, have an opportunity to examine all ofthese documents and an opportunity to observe the ruthless manner inwhich this special legislation was administered. It is perhapssuperfluous to quote a statement by the president of the court ofappeals of Danzig summarizing the situation in his district for a2-month period in 1942 following the effective date of the decree of 4December 1941. There were, he says, no complaints about too lenientdecisions during the period reported on.The defendant Schlegelberger, shortly after the decree becameeffective, conferred with the Reich Governor of Eastern Territoriesand worked out a system of administration pursuant to the decree of4 December 1941, which (1) provided for summary courts martial, (2)delegated to the Reich Governor the sole right to grant amnesty,and (3) agreed to the holding of civilian prisoners as hostages. Insummarizing the results of this conference the defendant Schlegelbergerassured the Reich Governor that the interest of the State can best beserved by regulating matters along the lines of our unanimous consent.Thus, it is clear that the extension of German law and German courtsinto the Eastern Territories, especially insofar as the Poles and theJews were concerned, eventually deprived them of any legal recoursewhatsoever.What has been said respecting the part played by key officials ofthe Ministry of Justice in extending German Law and the German courtsystem to the occupied territories is equally true of Czechoslovakiaand particularly the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. In one sense,by virtue of the fact that Czechoslovakia fell to the Nazis beforethe war, the experience there served as a proving ground for measureswhich were later extended to the Eastern Territories and other occupiedcountries.The decree of 14 April 1939 and the decrees of 2 November 1942 andof 1 July 1943, the texts of which, among others, will be presentedin evidence, mark the progress of the Nazis in extending Germanjurisdiction to Czechoslovakia and are mute evidence of the legaljustification for the robbery, extortion, and atrocities, the knowledgeof which has already shocked the world. The prosecution will showthat the Ministry of Justice not only had full knowledge of what wasgoing on in the Protectorate, but its experts took a leading partin the establishment and administration of the court system in theProtectorate from the very outset to the end of the war as they did inthe Eastern Territories.As the evidence unfolds we will see the defendant Schlegelberger activein drafting legal justification. We shall see the defendant Lautzconcerned with even minute matters of administration of the PeoplesCourt in the trial of Czechoslovak nationals both in Prague and thoseremoved for trial to Berlin, and we shall note that many of the otherdefendants were called upon from time to time for their assistance inmaking the court system function to the maximum required by NationalSocialist policies as they were enforced upon the Czechoslovak nation.In refusing citizens of occupied territories protection of the law,the defendants abetted and brought about the murder of thousands ofpersons. The acts of the defendants violated the laws of the countrieswhere committed and were repugnant to the laws of every civilizedcountry. In administering occupied territory, the defendants were boundby the Hague Convention to respect family honor and rights. Theseobligations the defendants ignored, and so squarely placed themselvesin the category of common war criminals.                      b. The Night and Fog DecreeOn 7 December 1941 the so-called Nacht und Nebel, or Night and FogDecree was issued pursuant to the orders of Hitler and Keitel. Perhapsnever in world history has there been a more perverted and diabolicalplot for intimidation and repression than this. Its terms providedthat in case of continued resistance on the part of the inhabitantsof certain of the occupied countries, but largely aimed at France,Belgium, and the Low Countries, the suspected perpetrators shouldbe spirited away without any indication of their whereabouts oreventual fate. The victims were to be tried by the OKW in the occupiedterritories only when it appeared probable that death sentences wouldbe quickly passed and executed. The others were to be taken to Germany,there to be tried by Special Courts. Whether the death sentence wasthere imposed, prison sentences given, or the individuals acquitted,the first and foremost purpose--that of complete secrecy so far astheir family and friends were concerned--was to be preserved. Thus, itis clear that the cognomen of Night and Fog was well chosen since intheory and practice the victims vanished as in the blackness of nightand were never heard of again.In the IMT opinion, the Court observed that--   The evidence is quite overwhelming of a systematic rule of   violence, brutality, and terror. * * *. After these civilians   arrived in Germany, no word of them was permitted to reach the   country from which they came or even their relatives; even   in cases when they died awaiting trial the families were not   informed, the purpose being to create anxiety in the minds of   the family of the arrested person. Hitlers purpose in issuing   this decree was stated by the defendant Keitel in a covering   letter, dated 12 December 1941, to be as follows:   Efficient and enduring intimidation can only be achieved   either by capital punishment or by measures by which the   relatives of the criminal and the population do not know the   fate of the criminal. This aim is achieved when the criminal is   transferred to Germany.[50]Preparations for the carrying out of the decree on the part of theWehrmacht were entrusted to Lieutenant General Lehmann[51] of thelegal department of the OKW. He conferred with various members of theMinistry of Justice to determine whether the Ministry would be ableand willing to assume the trials of the captured individuals shippedto Germany from the occupied countries. It is more than interesting tonote from a statement signed by General Lehmann that, in his opinion,the defendant Schlegelberger was the only official in the Ministry ofJustice at that time who had the authority to agree to assume the trialof these cases.The total number of victims of Nacht und Nebel may never be known, butwe do know that as of 1 November 1943 the Wehrmacht had delivered atotal of more than 5,200 Nacht und Nebel prisoners for trial to theseveral courts throughout Germany designated by the Ministry of Justicefor that purpose.Originally there were four Special Courts assigned to handle the Nachtund Nebel cases. The Special Court at Kiel was assigned to the casesarising in Norway; Cologne to the French cases; Essen to Belgium; andBerlin for cases of a special nature. In the later stages of the Nachtund Nebel program the effectiveness of Allied bombing made it necessaryto shift the location of some of these courts, principally in thetransfer of the Cologne court to Breslau.When we call the roll of the defendants before us today who acted inand were principally responsible for the large part which the Ministryof Justice played in the Nacht und Nebel program, we find there thenames of Schlegelberger, von Ammon, Mettgenberg, Lautz, Engert, andJoel, in addition to others who played less conspicuous, if not lessimportant, roles. If we were to select one of these men who above allothers should have known the criminal nature of the Nacht und Nebelprogram, such a man might very well have been the defendant von Ammonwho was the Ministry of Justices specialist in international law. Yetthe fact is that the name, von Ammon, together with that of Mettgenbergrecur again and again as the principal negotiators with the OKW inmatters concerning the application of law and the administration of theNacht und Nebel program.The Reich Minister of Justice, in a letter to the public prosecutorscharged with trying Nacht und Nebel cases, outlined in detail themeasures which were to be taken to assure complete secrecy of thetrials. This letter, from which we quote extensively as follows wasendorsed, among others, by von Ammon (_NG-269, Pros. Ex. 319_):   With regard to criminal procedures on account of punishable   offenses against the Reich or against the occupying forces in   the occupied territories, I request observance of the following   directives, in order not to endanger the necessary top secrecy   of the procedure, particularly regarding the execution of death   sentences and other cases of death among prisoners:   1. The cards used for investigations for the Reich criminal   statistics need not be filled in. Likewise, notification of the   penal records office will be discontinued until further notice.   However, sentences will have to be registered in lists or on a   card index in order to make possible an entry into the penal   records in due course.   2. In cases of death, especially in cases of execution of NN   prisoners, as well as in cases of female NN prisoners giving   birth to a child, the registrar must be notified as prescribed   by law. However, the following remark has to be added:   By order of the Reich Minister of the Interior, the entry into   the death (birth) registry must bear an endorsement, saying that   examination of the papers, furnishing of information and of   certified copies of death or birth certificates is admissible   only with the consent of the Reich Minister of Justice.   3. In case an NN prisoner sentenced to death desires to draw   up a public will, the judge or notary public and, if necessary,   other persons whose presence is required will have access to   the prisoner. Only officials of the Ministry of Justice may be   called as witnesses. The persons who assist the drawing up of   the will are, if necessary, to be sworn to secrecy. The will has   to be taken into official custody according to article 2 of the   Testaments Law. The disposition receipt has to be kept by the   prosecution until further notice.   4. Farewell letters by NN prisoners as well as other letters   must not be mailed. They have to be forwarded to the prosecution   who will keep them until further notice.   5. If an NN prisoner who has been sentenced to death and   informed of the forthcoming execution of the death sentence   desires spiritual assistance by the prison padre, this will be   granted. If necessary, the padre must be sworn to secrecy.   6. The relatives will not be informed of the death, especially   of the execution of an NN prisoner. The press will not be   informed of the execution of a death sentence, nor must the   execution of a death sentence be publicly announced by posters.   7. The bodies of executed NN prisoners or prisoners who died   from other causes have to be turned over to the State police for   burial. Reference must be made to the existing regulations on   secrecy. It must be pointed out especially that the graves of NN   prisoners must not be marked with the names of the deceased.   The bodies must not be used for teaching or research purposes.   8. Legacies of NN prisoners who have been executed or died from   other causes must be kept at the prison where the sentence was   served.It is not our purpose here to review all of the gruesome details ofcarrying out the spirit of the Nacht und Nebel program which became thedaily routine of these defendants. As the Court will see, all of thestipulations regarding the secrecy of the original decree and indeedthe addition of other unbelievably harsh and inhuman provisions weresystematically executed and improved upon by these men. If, to take oneexample, the Wehrmacht erroneously arrested in the occupied countriesindividuals who were patently innocent of any resistance to the Nazis,these victims, in order to preserve the secrecy of the program, had tobe treated in exactly the same way as other individuals who managed toescape with a prison sentence. Never did the families and friends ofthe convicted or innocent know their fate. In the alleged trials beforethe Special Courts none of the accused was, at any time, ever able tointroduce evidence from his own country as to his innocence and, in nocase, were the accused permitted to choose legal counsel other thanthat assigned to them by the court.Again the defendants flagrantly violated rights secured by the HagueConvention of citizens of countries occupied by the German armedforces--the right of family honor, the lives of persons, and the rightto be judged under their own laws.     c. Illegal Transfer of Prison Inmates to Concentration CampsMR. WOOLEYHAN: A Ministry of Justice policy of exterminationthrough calculated denial of all judicial and penal process, in closecollaboration with the Gestapo and SS, characterizes the secondsubstantive group of crimes previously mentioned. By 1939, inspectionsof Reich penitentiaries operated by the Ministry of Justice disclosedthat large numbers of political prisoners in security detention wereengaged in paid labor on projects incompatible with the rearmamenteffort which then was at a climax. At Hitlers order these prisoninmates were transferred to concentration camps where their workcould be both unpaid and of more use to munition requirements. Thuswas initiated a program which was to eventually erase any practicaldifference between the fates of those victims who were put through theshams of criminal court procedure, and those who were thrown by thepolice into concentration camps without the formality of a hearing.Apparently noting that transfers from Reich prisons to concentrationcamps aroused no immediate public clamor or official opposition, judgessaw therein an outlet for increasingly burdensome numbers of criminalcases, particularly political cases, as the defendant Engert has stated(_NG-471, Pros. Ex. 276_):   In 1940 or 1941 I wrote to Himmler suggesting that he take me   into the Gestapo. My idea was to get in closer touch with the   Gestapo in order to get an insight into the activities of the   Gestapo, and then to reach a better relationship between the   Gestapo and the Peoples Court. * * * I also wanted to prevent   the possibility of insignificant cases being brought up in the   Peoples Court, which could be better handed over to the Gestapo   for a short term internment in a concentration camp.About the time that Engert, then vice president of the Peoples Court,made this overture to Himmler, he began to complain officially that itwas incompatible with the respect, dignity, and tasks of the PeoplesCourt to try minor political cases. He opined that such cases could besettled more quickly and effectively by transferring the culprit to aconcentration camp. Thierack, then president of the Peoples Court, inheartily endorsing Engerts attitude, wrote to the Minister of Justicein 1940 in part as follows:   However right it is to exterminate harshly and uproot all the   seeds of insurrection, as for example we see them in Bohemia   and Moravia, _it is wrong for every follower_, even the   smallest, _to be given the honor of appearing_ for trial   and being judged for high treason _before the Peoples Court,   or_ failing that, _before an appellate court_. In order   to deal with these small cases and even with the smallest,   the culprits should surely be shown that German sovereignty   will not put up with their behavior and will take action   accordingly. That can be done in a different way and I think   in a more advantageous one, than through the tedious and also   very expensive and ponderous channels of court procedure. I have   therefore no objection whatsoever, if all the small hangers-on   who are somehow connected with the high treason plans which have   been woven and abetted and plotted by others are brought to   their senses by being transferred to a concentration camp for   some time.These opinions and desires of Engert and Thierack found eager andsympathetic audience with the Gestapo and SS, resulting in workingagreements between these agencies and the Ministry of Justice wherebysuch illegal transfers could be accomplished outside the law. As theInternational Military Tribunal in its judgment has found--   An agreement made with the Ministry of Justice on 18 September   1942 provided that antisocial elements who had finished prison   sentences were to be delivered to the SS to be worked to   death.[52]This agreement, it will be noted, expanded the initial ideas of Engertand Thierack far beyond any more hastening of minor political courtcases or exploitation of prison labor. The agreement introduced theideas of exterminating the so-called asocials, i.e., persons who foreither racial, political, or personality reasons were deemed unfitto live. Within a month after this agreement had been worked out andput into practice, it was expanded further to include not only thoseasocial elements who had finished their prison sentences, but alsoall Jews, gypsies, Russians, and Ukrainians who were detained underarrest or imprisonment in any Reich penitentiary or work house, as wellas all Poles who were sentenced to more than 3 years.Now, since the intentional design was to literally work these people todeath once they were transferred to concentration camps, this expandedillegal agreement actually rendered any court sentence for any crimetantamount to a death sentence.In some cases the death awaiting these unfortunates was not longin coming. For example, a situation report in 1942 from theAttorney General of the Court of Appeals in Berlin to the defendantSchlegelberger, while the latter was Acting Minister of Justice,revealed the following episode:   In this connection I think I ought to point out that only   recently perpetrators have been repeatedly handed over to the   Gestapo. Also, there was no sufficient cause therefore, to be   found in my opinion, in the conduct of the justice authorities.   I am referring to criminal procedures against Skibbe and others   * * *.Then follows the citation of the case in the German files:    * * * in which 4 defendants--26, 22, 20, and 18 years of age,   respectively--accused of committing 23, 19, 15, and 12 completed   or attempted robberies, respectively, by taking advantage of   air raid protection measures, were sentenced by the Special   Court of Berlin to 7, 6, and 5 years of penal servitude and   loss of civil rights for 10 years each. Although 3 of the   perpetrators had not been convicted previously and the fourth   one only of 2 comparatively minor crimes, in addition to all   of them still being comparatively young and, at least in my   opinion, the pronounced penalties being not inadequate, these   perpetrators were handed over to the Gestapo. They were shot, as   could be seen from the newspaper reports because they offered   resistance. May I remark that it is hardly unknown to the   public any longer that these shootings because of resistance   offered are actually caused by other considerations.Still operating completely beyond any existing law, decree orregulation, this same cabal of justice officials, SS and Gestapoextended this policy of extermination through the Occupied EasternTerritories. As the SS and SD offices throughout those easterncountries were instructed in November 1942--   The Reich Leader SS has come to an agreement with the Reich   Minister of Justice Thierack that the courts will forego the   carrying out of regular criminal procedures against Poles   and members of the eastern peoples. These people of foreign   extraction henceforth shall be turned over to the police. Jews   and gypsies are to be treated likewise. This agreement was   approved by the Fuehrer.These instructions to the SS and SD in the East continue:   Those considerations which may be right for the punishment   of an offense committed by a German are wrong with regard   to the punishment of an offense committed by a person of   foreign extraction. The personal motives of the offender are   to be disregarded completely. Important only is that this   offense endangers the order of the German community, and that,   therefore, measures must be taken to prevent further dangers.   In other words, the offense committed by a person of foreign   extraction is not to be judged from the point of view of legal   retribution by way of justice, but from the point of view of   preventing danger through police action. From this follows that   the criminal procedure against persons of foreign extraction   must be transferred from the courts to the police.With the Jews, Poles, gypsies, Ukrainians and other so-called asocialpersons throughout the occupied east relegated to a carefully prepareddeath, this same unholy alliance returned its attention to the Reichand the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. There, by the infamousdecree of 1 July 1943,[53] signed among others by Thierack, all ofthe foregoing perversions of judicial and penal process were tardilylegalized by officially denying to all Jews any recourse to thecriminal courts and committed any Jews accused of an undefinedcriminal action to the police.With grim humor the following article of that statute ordered theconfiscation by the Reich of a Jews property after his death.This decree completed the absolute disfranchisement and expropriationof property of Jews in the Third Reich and Bohemia and Moravia who hadnot already, by that time, been deported or slain.Prison inmates not transferred to concentration camps, pursuant tothe foregoing program, were hardly better off in Reich prisons underthe hospitality of the Minister of Justice. The defendant Joel had aworking agreement with a deputy of Himmlers whereby he turned over tothe SS, for shooting, those defendants whose sentences by the courtswere deemed insufficient by Hitler who followed published decisions inthe newspapers. A number of charts tabulating the shootings of suchdefendants, many of whom had received only minor sentences, attest toJoels zealous activity on this score. Schlegelberger, too, studiouslyconcocted what was deemed a legal basis for these shootings of prisoninmates serving minor sentences.         d. Judicial Murders in Violation of International LawVictims of the Peoples Court, Special Courts, and civil courtsmartial were judicially murdered by certain of the defendants using avariety of legalistic artifices, all of which had the obvious commondenominator of a zealous desire to exterminate even trifling activitynot even deemed misdemeanors by the community of civilized nations.One such artifice frequently employed was a subjective, conclusiveassumption by the judges and prosecutors of proof of the very issuestried. For example, after the Nazi importation of forced labor from theoccupied East had collected large numbers of foreign workers within theReich at various war jobs against their will, escape efforts by suchworkers across Reich frontiers to their homeland or elsewhere becamefrequent. These escapees, when apprehended by border officials, werenormally handed over to the Peoples Court for trial for preparationof high treason, which bore a mandatory sentence of death. Theapplicable section of the German criminal code defined high treason inthis context as an attempt to incorporate by violence or by threatof violence the German territory in its entirety or in part into aforeign State or to detach from the Reich territory belonging to theReich. The escapees were indicted, inconceivable as it may be, for theviolation of this provision.In grasping for some legal straw upon which to base a conviction onthese grounds, the courts created a whole-cloth assumption that suchescapees were heading through Switzerland, or wherever they might havebeen picked up, in an effort to join some military legion hostile tothe Reich. The Reich prosecutors were drawn into this scheme. WalterBrem, a former assistant to the chief Reich prosecutor at the PeoplesCourt, described the situation thus (_NG-316, Pros. Ex. 79_):   The majority of these cases concerned foreign laborers who   wanted to look for a job in Switzerland because of inadequate   salaries and insufficient food rations in the Reich. The   prosecution, however, claimed that foreign legions were being   established in Switzerland and that every foreigner wanting to   cross the border illegally did so in order to join up with such   legions. I was ordered by the prosecutor of the Peoples Court   to connect the defendants somehow with the foreign legions.   I have never received a positive answer about those alleged   organizations, and the whole concept was known to the foreigners   only as a rumor. Individual proof of any acts of high treason   could not be established; however, the prosecution based its   claims on the assumption that such foreign laborers would behave   in a hostile manner against Germany once given the opportunity.This contention was acceptable to judges of the Peoples Court. On 12August 1942, three Polish defendants, Mazur, Kubisz, and Nowakowski,pursuant to an indictment signed by the defendant Lautz, were sentencedto death by the Peoples Court for preparation of high treason andattempting to separate a portion of the Reich by force. They had lefttheir factory in Thuringia and proceeded across the Swiss border, wherethey were apprehended by Swiss officials and returned to the Reich.As reasons for their escape the defendants cited the hard workingconditions to which they had been exposed. Kubisz testified thatthe meals consisted only of soup. Mazur stated that his work in thequarry was so hard that he feared he would not survive the winter. Thedefendants stated they had hoped to find better working conditions inSwitzerland. They denied having had any knowledge of the existence ofa Polish Legion in Switzerland. The prosecution offered no evidence toimpeach these statements in any way.Nevertheless, the Peoples Court found that the defendants statementswere mere excuses, that the existence of a Polish Legion in Switzerlandwas generally known, and that the defendants intended to join thislegion. This judicial assumption was buttressed by a physicianscertificate which showed all three defendants to be in excellent healthand qualified for active service. Therefore, the court was convincedthat the defendants had discussed the fate of Poland and her peoplewith their camp mates in the factory barracks and had decided to jointhe Polish Legion in Switzerland. The court said that it knew of apact with Russia that the Polish government in exile had formed, andthat this fact had been broadcast by the British radio. The courtknew, furthermore, that in the past Polish workers had repeatedly fledto Switzerland where they were recruited for the Polish Legion, and Iquote a portion of the courts decision:   These circumstances force the court to the conclusion that the   defendants intended to join the Polish Legion in Switzerland.With regard to verbal remarks deemed seditious or deleterious to theGerman peoples defensive strength, Peoples Courts sentences werenot only outrageously unjustified, but reached the climax of judicialcaprice. The Austrian taxicab driver, Rudolf Kozian, pursuant to anindictment signed by Lautz, was sentenced to death on 26 June 1944for making certain uncomplimentary remarks concerning Hitler and theprogress of the war. In the course of conversation while driving afemale customer, who later denounced him to the Gestapo, he maderemarks typified by the following:   To us Viennese its all the same from whom we receive our bread   whether his name is Stalin, Churchill, or Hitler. What matters   is that we can live. When I quarrel with someone and see that   I can no longer carry on, then I stop and do not continue the   fight until everything is destroyed. The Fuehrer in his speech   said that he would destroy us all. The Fuehrer has said that   this war will be fought until one side will be annihilated.   Every child knows that we are that side, unless the Fuehrer will   come to his senses before then and offers peace to the enemy.The court found the defendant guilty of having attempted to underminethe German morale to such an extent that he was deemed to come withinthe special Emergency Decree authorizing death for impairing Germandefensive strength.Contrast the foregoing case of the Austrian taxi driver, resident ofa country occupied and annexed by illegal aggressive acts, with thatof Mrs. von Brincken, a German Nazi, who was indicted in August 1944for having made similar statements in a conversation with friends atthe seashore. When the man who had rented her a beach chair becameangry about the careless way in which his chair was treated, Mrs. vonBrincken was alleged to have said: Well, dont worry, the Russiancommissars will be sitting in them next year. She was also vocallyindignant to her neighbors because her 17-year-old daughter had justbeen drafted for labor assignment in the country, and said: It woulddo the farmers no good; they would only get more work and more worrysince the girl could not do anything but eat. Due to the intercessionof both her husband, a colonel, and a notorious SS general who was afriend of the family, she was released with an admonition.Such judicial discrimination with death as the forfeit, is explainedby the defendant Petersen, a lay judge at the Peoples Court from 1941until the end of the war (_NG-396, Pros. Ex. 176_).   The sentences of the Peoples Court can be understood only if   one keeps in mind the intent underlying the penalties. This   was not primarily that of imposing punishment in accordance   with normal bourgeois conceptions of crime and punishment,   but rather of annihilating an opposition which could become   detrimental to the German aims.DR. ASCHENAUER (defense counsel for defendant Petersen): Bymy motion of 21 February 1947 I objected to the submission of theaffidavit of the defendant Petersen. On 27 February 1947, I specifiedthe motion. It says: The defense is not permitted to introduce theaffidavit and the interrogations under oath of the defendant Peterseninto the proceedings. On 21 February 1947 I gave the reasons for themotion which are as follows: From 12 June until the end of 1946, thedefendant Petersen was in the Langwasser camp. As a patient, he wasmoved to the Regensburg camp where his medical treatment was continued.Already at Langwasser, Petersen was pronounced unfit for transport.In spite of medical treatment, he was moved to Nuernberg. As hecollapsed in Regensburg, medical treatment for circulation disturbancewas continued at the court prison here; the circulation disturbanceimproved only at Christmas 1946. Accommodation in a cell in which halfa window was missing, was naturally very detrimental to the state ofhealth of the 61-year-old defendant Petersen. Therefore--PRESIDING JUDGE MARSHALL: Counsel for the defendant is advisedthat the statement of counsel is not evidence in this case. It ismerely a statement of what later will be introduced in evidence. Ifthis statement is introduced in evidence, you can make your objectionand it will then be ruled upon. For the moment, the prosecution willcontinue its statement.DR. ASCHENAUER: I should only like to point out that thisis the same affidavit which is being presented here and that thisaffidavit is due to the psychological condition of the witness.PRESIDING JUDGE MARSHALL: I repeat. This is not evidence. Thisis merely a statement of what will later be introduced in evidence. Atthat time, if you have an objection, it will be considered. At thistime, you may not interrupt the statement of the prosecution.DR. ASCHENAUER: I will raise my objection at a later time.MR. WOOLEYHAN: To get the proper context, I will begin at thebeginning of the excerpt included in the opening statement (_NG-396,Pros. Ex. 176_).   The sentences of the Peoples Court can be understood only if   one keeps in mind the intent underlying the penalties. This   was not primarily that of imposing punishment in accordance   with normal bourgeois conceptions of crime and punishment,   but rather of annihilating an opposition which could become   detrimental to the German aims. This was our duty. Hence, after   a defendant had been brought before the Peoples Court because   of some act or utterance, his actual deed was of no particular   importance in the determination of the punishment within the   framework of the law. The important thing was whether the man   had to be exterminated from the community of the people as a   public enemy because of his personal attitudes and his social   or antisocial tendencies.The further artifice of punishment by analogy, previously mentionedgenerally, was as tyrannical in practice as it seems in theory.Revolting examples of this procedure in action are legion. Aparticularly notorious case that turned on this ground was that ofLehmann Katzenberger, 68-year-old former chairman of the NuernbergJewish congregation. Katzenberger was indicted before the Nuernbergdistrict court for so-called racial pollution, having been accusedof sexual relations with one Irene Seiler, an Aryan woman. The policetried desperately without success to secure the necessary conclusiveevidence, but Katzenberger and Seiler, both well-known figures of someprestige in the community, denied under oath any illicit relationship.There were no witnesses to or other evidence of the accused act. Sincean acquittal of the Jew was unthinkable, particularly in Nuernbergwhich was the hearthstone of the Jew-baiter Streicher, and whosenewspaper Der Stuermer widely publicized the story, Katzenberger wasremanded to the Nuernberg Special Court, tried as a public enemy,sentenced to death, and executed. Seiler was indicted for perjury andwas joined with Katzenberger as codefendant; her sentence of two yearsimprisonment was later suspended.As Hans Groben, Nuernberg district court judge for preliminaryinvestigations, describes the case (_NG-554, Pros. Ex. 153_)--   As I had no reason to doubt the truth of Seilers sworn   statement it was clear to me that I could not keep Katzenberger   in custody any longer. Therefore I informed his counsel, Dr.   Herz, about the result of this interrogation and gave him to   understand that this was the right time to act against the   warrant of arrest. Dr. Herz naturally understood this hint,   and at once he filed a complaint against the warrant of   arrest. According to the regulation (section 33 of the Code   of Criminal Procedure) I put the complaint before the public   prosecution, adding in my report that I had the intention to   comply with this complaint (section 306, paragraph 2, Code of   Criminal procedure), i.e., to set Katzenberger free. I thus   clearly expressed with this additional remark that I believed   Katzenberger to be innocent * * *. As was later explained to   me, the indictment already filed with the penal chamber of the   district court was thereupon withdrawn and replaced by one filed   with the Special Court.          *       *       *       *       *       *       *   I was shocked when I heard the result of the trial. The fact   that Rothaug combined the trial against Seiler, a case of   perjury, with the trial against Katzenberger, shows clearly that   he took over the case of Katzenberger with definite prejudice   and that he was determined to exclude Seiler as a witness for   the defendant. For, according to normal procedure, Seiler   should have been a _witness_ in Katzenbergers trial   and should have testified for him stating that the charges   against Katzenberger were not true. This normally should have   led to the acquittal of Katzenberger, as otherwise there was   nothing decisive against him. Rothaugs verdict, in my opinion,   was based solely on blind hatred of Jews. While there were   no reasons for Katzenbergers condemnation on the ground of   so-called race defilement, there was still less reason to apply   section 4 of the Decree against Public Enemies, because if it   was altogether impossible to ascertain when or if Katzenberger   and Seiler had the alleged sexual intercourse, it was still less   possible to explain that this had happened in exploitation of   war conditions. To arrive at Katzenbergers condemnation on the   grounds of so-called race defilement in connection with section   4 of the Decree against Public Enemies, it was necessary to   violate all the facts of the case. It has always depressed me   that such a verdict, which cannot be designated as anything but   judicial murder, was pronounced by Rothaug.One further sampling of the prosecutions evidence will serve to revealhow the protection against double jeopardy, keystone of criminalprocedure the world over, was abrogated and used for the murder ofcivilians of occupied countries.The Nuernberg Special Court, under the leadership of the defendantsRothaug and Oeschey, used this fiendish practice in the case of JanLopata, a Polish youth brought during the war to work on a German farm.The accused was sentenced in 1940 to 2 years imprisonment by theNeumarkt local court for indecent assault on his employers wife. Aplea of nullity against the decision was filed by the prosecution onthe grounds that the sentence was too lenient and the case was reviewedby the Reich Supreme Court with the result that it was referred to theNuernberg Special Court for retrial. In the courts verdict sentencingLopata to death, the presiding judge (the defendant Rothaug) observed(_NG-337, Pros. Ex. 186_)--   The total inferiority of the accused lies in his character and   is obviously based on the fact that he belongs to the Polish   subhuman race.[54]In reliance upon the decrees legalizing nullification and retrial ofcriminal cases at the prosecutions behest, defendants were deprived ofany assurance that a sentence of less than death was their final fate.Ministry of Justice officials, working through the prosecution, joinedin this infliction of double jeopardy. For example, in a case involvinga non-German, the defendant Klemm wrote to the president and attorneygeneral of the Stuttgart District Court of Appeals on 5 July 1944 anddirected the following (_NG-676, Pros. Ex. 178_):   For some time now, the jurisdiction of the penal senate of   the district court of appeals in Stuttgart has given me cause   for grave thoughts with regard to matters of defeatism. In the   majority of cases, the sentences are considered too mild * * *   and are in an incompatible disproportion to the sentences which   are in similar cases passed by the Peoples Court and by other   district courts of appeal. I refer especially to the following   sentences which lately attracted my attention:   1. Criminal case against Friedrich Linder, sentence of the   Second Penal Senate of 7 January 1944 (President of the Senate,   Dr. Kiefer) * * *. You made a report under date 28 April 1944   on this case regarding the sentence. In view of the danger and   of the frequency of the statements made by the defendant, I   must maintain the interpretation already expressed in my decree   of 15 March 1944, IV Secret I 5045B/44 that the defendant, a   foreigner, deserved a serious sentence of penal servitude. I   have therefore directed the files to the chief Reich prosecutor   at the Peoples Court to examine the question whether the   extraordinary appeal should not be applied against the sentence   * * *.[55]It is technically true that an extraordinary appeal or plea of nullitycould, on the face of the enabling decrees, operate to a defendantsbenefit as well as to his detriment; but this possibility was illusoryin practice. Dr. Josef Grueb, former judge of the Nuernberg DistrictCourt of Appeals, says (_NG-672, Pros. Ex. 179_):   It was obvious that the Ministry of Justice only admitted a   petition for nullity when it was unfavorable to the defendant.   Cases in which the Ministry ordered a nullity plea unfavorable   to the defendant were, at any rate, much more numerous than   cases where the petition for nullity was demanded for the   benefit of the defendant on the Ministrys own initiative.   * * * It was mainly a means employed by the State to cancel   sentences which seemed inadequate in the light of the political   conceptions of those times.A terrifying glimpse of the actual extent to which double jeopardy wasexploited during the Third Reichs last years, is furnished by thedefendant Nebelung (_NG-333, Pros. Ex. 177_).   If the Chief Reich Prosecutor, Dr. Lautz, was not satisfied   with the sentence, he could file an extraordinary appeal against   it. This was done, in my opinion, mainly as a result of orders   by Reich Minister Thierack. After 1943, extraordinary appeals   became frequent. All cases in which an extraordinary appeal had   been filed were tried again before the special senate of the   Peoples Court. This special senate concerned itself exclusively   with extraordinary appeals. Of all senates of the Peoples   Court, this special senate pronounced the largest percentage of   death sentences. According to statistics which I saw myself, 70   percent of all sentences passed by the special senate during   1944 were, as I recall, death sentences.By the foregoing samples from actual case records and comments thereonby German jurists involved, the prosecution has sought to typify ratherthan specify the war crimes and crimes against humanity committed bythe defendants. Detailed accounts are unnecessary at the moment toexemplify the judicial murders and legalistic perversions for whichthese defendants have been indicted; that will be fully developed bythe evidence.                     e. Evidentiary ConsiderationsMR. LAFOLLETTE: We believe it will expedite the trial of thiscase and be of assistance to the Court and evidence a proper attitudeof fairness toward the attorneys for these defendants if we discuss nowsome of the theories of evidence and of the relevancy and materialityof evidence under which we shall present the proof in this case.Law No. 10, which is the inter-power act from which this Court springs,contains some matter relevant to the issue, while Ordinance No. 7,of necessity, treats the matter very fully. Between them they dealadequately with the matter of the competency of proof, intelligentlyrelaxing the rules of the necessities of presenting proof in a countrywhich has not only been physically destroyed, but which has had itsgovernment disintegrate and also suffered the demoralization whichfollows the defeat of a vicious ideology which has permeated thethinking of far too many of its people.But relevancy and materiality--the relationship of primary facts to theultimate fact--involves a cerebral process, the method of finding theexistence of an ultimate fact by logical processes from objective proof.These latter standards lie within the consciousness and the conscienceof man. Thus, they are not affected by the external considerationswhich justify the relaxation of the rules regulating the competency ofproof. They should not have been and they were not relaxed. We endorsethe decision to retain them and welcome the opportunity to work underthem.Article II, paragraphs 4(_a_) and (_b_) of Law No. 10, arethe same in substance, although differing slightly in the use oflanguage to express the substance as articles 7 and 8 of the Charter,respectively.These paragraphs of article II of Law No. 10 read as follows:   4. (_a_) The official position of any person, whether as   Head of State or as the responsible official in a Government   Department, does not free him from responsibility for a crime or   entitle him to mitigation of punishment.   (_b_) The fact that any person acted pursuant to the   order of his Government or of a superior does not free him from   responsibility for a crime, but may be considered in mitigation.Paragraph 4 (_a_) is a sound rule and applies to most, if notall, of these defendants. Paragraph 4 (_b_) is likewise sound. Wepoint out, however, that these defendants are lawyers who are chargedfundamentally with perverting or converting a system of justice intoan instrument for committing crimes under international law. Sincethis paragraph affords them the right to offer evidence in mitigationand to plead for mitigation from that evidence, the prosecution isentitled to answer that plea by two arguments. First, that a lawyer hasspecial knowledge of the perverting effect upon the dispensation ofjustice not only of his own acts, but of the acts of others of whichhe has knowledge--knowledge as an ultimate fact. Second, that a lawyerentrusted by his very calling with a sacred duty must of necessityoffer strong proof indeed in mitigation of the prostitution of thatduty.We shall introduce proof on this issue from which knowledge, as anultimate fact will arise, and also proof from which the plea ofmitigation will be shown to be fanciful and hypocritical.Again upon the subject of relevancy and materiality--probativevalue--we shall offer evidence of other acts of these defendants andalso acts of persons other than these defendants, knowledge of which asan ultimate fact can be inferred to the defendants. These acts shallinclude those which constitute evidence of other crimes committed bothby these defendants and by others. We are convinced that this evidenceis relevant and material, and therefore admissible under accepted rulesof evidence supported by Wigmore, an acknowledged authority.Certainly, a brief exposition of our position will expedite the trialby enabling the Court to rule expeditiously, but at the same timejudiciously, and it is also our hope that by furnishing defense counselwith an understanding of the legality of the rules under which thisevidence will be offered, they will not find it necessary to resort toofrequently to empty objections.We can afford to be candid with Court and counsel. It is only the lazy,the uninformed, or inherently dishonest and therefore unethical lawyerwho seeks recourse to silence or obtusion. We refuse to follow a courseof conduct from which either of the foregoing can be charged to theprosecution of cases before this Tribunal and its sister Tribunals.Evidence of acts, including other crimes not only of the defendants butof others, is permissible and most often offered to show knowledge,intent or design. They are also relevant upon the issue of motive.Because of the nature of the crimes charged in this indictment, each ofthe foregoing, knowledge, intent, or design and motive, is an essentialultimate element or ingredient of those crimes. Therefore, the ruleswhich authorize the introduction of such proof are of concern to thisCourt.Before treating the subject affirmatively, we shall prepare the way byeliminating the supposed objection of unfair surprise. We offer thefollowing quote:   Of the other objections (other than undue prejudice) from   the point of view of that auxiliary policy which creates the   character rule, the objection of unfair surprise is the only one   that could be supposed to be here applicable. But it has never   been treated by the courts as of consequence. * * * Evidence   tending to show, not the defendants entire career, but his   specific knowledge, motive, design, and the other immediate   matters leading up to and succeeding the crime, is of a class   always to be anticipated and is in such given instance rarely   a surprise; moreover, the kernel of the objection of unfair   surprise, namely, the impossibility of exposing fabricated   evidence, is wanting where the evidence deals with matters   so closely connected with a crime as design, motive, and the   like.[56]The above quote referred to the further objection of undue prejudice.That objection does not arise here. This is a trial by the court--byjudges. It is a trial by judges who by training and character relyonly upon objective standards in determining guilt or innocence. Therule was never considered in America as a necessary protection to adefendant in trials by court.In fact, the very contrast between the system and standards ofjudicial conduct by which these defendants are being tried and thesubjective personality yard sticks which they, particularly thejudicial defendants, will be proved to have acted under and used, itis to be hoped, will have some effect in serving the declared purposeof Potsdam, to prepare for the eventual reconstruction of a Germanpolitical life on a democratic basis * * *.In treating the subject under discussion, we must refrain, because oftime limitation, from presenting Wigmores excellent philosophicaldiscussion of the basic principles which govern the proof of knowledge,intent, and design. Therefore we limit ourselves, from necessity, to anexposition of those statements which are applicable to the crime whichmost, if not all, of these defendants have committed--murder.We shall offer the type of evidence under discussion, first under theknowledge principle:   The knowledge principle has practically little application   here, though it would be available to show a knowledge of the   nature and injurious effect of a lethal weapon.[57]We point out that in this case knowledge of the nature and injuriouseffect of a lethal weapon is of first importance. The defendants hadfull knowledge of the character of this lethal weapon--a judicialsystem deliberately fashioned into a headmans axe. In fact, most ofthem directly and actively fashioned it. Consequently, under eachof the categories of the substantive law of murder, which we haveheretofore expounded, and particularly under the second, proof of prioracts, including crimes of those defendants and of others of which theyhad knowledge, are clearly relevant.The same type of evidence shall be offered under the following rulerelating to the intent principle:   The intent principle receives constant application; for the   intent to kill is in homicide practically always in issue, and   is to be proved by the prosecution, and the recurrence of other   acts of the sort tends to negative inadvertence, defensive   purpose, or any other form of innocent intent. For this purpose,   therefore, the evidence is receivable irrespective of whether   the act charged is itself conceded or not * * *.[58]Also the rule of anonymous intent authorizes the introduction of proofof such other crimes and of the crimes of others.   The principle of anonymous intent finds occasional application,   particularly in poisoning cases. Other instances of death   by poison under somewhat similar circumstances serve to   negative the supposition of inadvertent taking or of mistaken   administration, even though the person responsible for the   other poisonings is not identified; and thus, a criminal intent   having been shown for the act charged, by whomsoever done, the   defendant may be then shown to be its doer.[59]This Court shall be called upon to determine whether a so-calledjudicial execution was a true judicial decision or poison handed thedefendant in a disguised chalice having the exterior appearance ofjudicial purity. When we produce innumerable cases of such acts, cana defendant be heard to say he did not know his monstrous chalice waslethal and intended it so to be?Also the principle of design or system is applicable for identicalreasons.   The principle of design or system finds here frequent   application. It supposes that a design or plan in the defendant   is to be shown, as making it probable that the defendant carried   out the design or plan and committed the act; and it receives   former similar acts so far as through common features they   naturally indicate the existence of such a plan, design, or   system, of which they are the partial fulfillment, or means.   This principle is fully recognized in the precedents * * *.[60]And finally prior acts of violence, including crimes, are evidence ofmotive as well as of design:   (3) Prior acts of violence by the defendant against the same   persons, besides evidencing intent, may also evidence emotion   or motive, i.e., a hostility showing him likely to do further   violence; * * *.   (4) Threats of violence are in themselves expressions of a   design to injure, and are accordingly dealt with elsewhere * *   *.[61]Certainly, when we shall offer so many cases of death of Poles andJews, no one of these defendants will have the temerity to say wecannot show proof of their own prior utterances, as well as those ofothers of which they had knowledge, as a clearly inferred ultimatefact, demanding death to Poles and Jews, and also that haste and morehaste must be made to turn the Nazi judicial system into a headmansaxe, for the purpose of showing their motive when they killed Poles andJews with their so-called judicial system and processes.It would be a strange law, indeed, which would say that if a man killedthe Pole or one Jew, his prior threats to and assaults upon that Poleor Jew were relevant evidence of the motive with which he acted, butwould deny the same proof, when the same man, or in this case men,killed millions of Poles and Jews.Of course, the law is neither so blind nor so callous.The accepted rules of proof in an objective system of law justifyevery offer of proof of prior statements, acts, and crimes of thesedefendants, and of those others of which they had knowledge, as anultimate fact, which we should make in this case.We need not, nor shall we attempt to, evade or circumvent thosesalutary rules.These defendants can and should be convicted, but only under law.Because we believe that, we have not been afraid to predeclare ourunderstanding both of the substantive law and the rules of evidenceunder which just convictions shall be asked, and which we believe willbe rightfully rendered under the proof adduced.Although the matter is not related to the theories under which evidencewill be offered by the prosecution, there is one other matter relatingto the evidence which the prosecution feels it is entitled to discussat the opening of this case.During the introduction of the evidence, certain names of importantofficials recur--Thierack, Freisler, Vollmer, Westphal, Crohne,Laemmle, Haffner, and others. Since these men are not in thedefendants dock, the Court is entitled to know why. Thierack committedsuicide on 26 October 1946. Freisler was killed in an air raid whichdemolished the Peoples Court building in Berlin, early in 1945.Vollmer forsook the Ministry of Justice for the Luftwaffe (air force)during the last days of the battle for Berlin in 1945, and was reportedto have died in action. Westphal committed suicide in the Nuernbergprison following service of the present indictment upon him. Crohne,Laemmle, and Haffner cannot be located, despite all efforts.           THE GERMAN LEGAL PROFESSION UNDER THE THIRD REICHWe have sketched the steps by which the judicial organization ofGermany was turned into a mere agent of the criminal policies of theThird Reich, and have outlined some of the crimes which the defendantscommitted by means of the perverted judicial machinery. Before takingup the fourth and final count of the indictment, which rests upona somewhat different footing than the first three counts, it isappropriate to examine very briefly the German legal profession and itsdegradation under the Third Reich. This brief survey, we think, willhelp to explain why these atrocities came to pass.                            a. Before 1933During the pre-Hitler decades, the professional life of German juristsflourished. Independent societies were formed which published lawreviews of high caliber and participated in international conferencesof jurists and in international legal institutions, such as theInternational Arbitration Courts.Originally, the judges of the various German States had separateprofessional organizations, but in 1908 these were combined intothe Association of German Judges (Deutscher Richterbund). Thisorganization sponsored lectures on new legal problems, on comparativelaw, on modernizing penal law, and similar subjects. The associationedited the German Judges Times (Deutsche Richterzeitung), whichpublished court decisions and articles by learned jurists. Anotherorganization of German judges was the Association of RepublicanJudges (Republikanischer Richterbund), founded in 1926. Its memberswere primarily interested in the reformation of the German courtsystem and in bringing German legal institutions into line with thedemocratic principles of the new Weimar constitution. They publishedthe periodical German Justice (Deutsche Justiz).Most practicing German attorneys at law belonged to the Associationof German Attorneys at law (Deutscher Anwaltsverein), the largestprofessional organization of jurists. This association, foundedin 1871, comprised about 15,000 members in 1933. It published theJuridical Weekly (Juristische Wochenschrift), which had thousands ofsubscribers inside Germany and abroad.Before the Nazis came to power, all organizations of jurists consistedof members of all political parties and creeds. Their officers wereeminent scholars or jurists, and many of them had a high internationalreputation. Their yearly meetings acted according to democraticprinciples without interference from the executive branch of thegovernment.Legal education and training in Germany maintained high standards.After studying law for 3 or 4 years at a law school of one of theState universities, the candidate served a law apprenticeship, lastinganother 3 or 4 years, at various courts and law firms. Only then washe admitted to the Great State Examination, known as the AssessorExamination, which might be compared with our bar examination. Thesuccessful completion of this examination was the legal prerequisitefor any appointment as judge, public prosecutor, or higher civilservant, or for admittance to the bar. The men and women who had passedthis examination were highly respected by the German populace.                        b. The Impact of NazismIn the years immediately preceding the establishment of the ThirdReich, the National Socialist Party started a nationwide campaigndirected against the legal profession. The Nazi leadership realizedthat they could not gain absolute dictatorship by the seizure of thegovernment alone, but that they must also completely subjugate Germanlegal life. As an affiliate of the Nazi Party, a National SocialistGerman Jurists League (Bund Nationalsozialistischer DeutschenJuristen) known as the BNSDJ, was formed in 1928 by the late HansFrank. In 1931, the members of this organization, then about 600 innumber, or less than 1 percent of all German jurists, were instructedto report on the political attitude and behavior of judges and lawyers.The general attitude of the Nazi Party toward independent judges wasreflected in the statement--   One day, we will forget the independence of the judges which   has no significance in itself.[62]There were many other occasions when Hitler and his henchmen expressedtheir distaste for law and the legal profession.Immediately after the Nazis came to power, they started to pervertGerman legal life and to develop it as a tool of the totalitarianmachine. This was accomplished in part by measures which have alreadybeen described, such as the dismissal of judges, prosecutors, andMinistry officials considered politically unreliable, and by deprivingjudges of the guaranties of independence and immunity from removal fromoffice.But these measures were not confined to the governmental judicialorganization. It extended into all branches of the legal profession.The first step was the subjugation, and later the complete elimination,of the old professional associations, such as the DeutscherRichterbund, the Republikanischer Richterbund, and the DeutscherAnwaltsverein. Their destruction was accomplished by the same sort ofmaneuvers that effected the dissolution of the pre-Nazi medical andother professional societies at about the same time.In the early spring of 1933, the former officers were ousted underduress, and new officers, all of them members of the Nazi Party,were appointed according to the newly proclaimed leadership principle(Fuehrer-prinzip). This procedure also became known under the termcoordination (Gleichschaltung). At the same time, the membershipof well-known anti-Nazi or Jewish jurists was canceled in all theseprofessional organizations. Many of them were threatened and forced toemigrate.Shortly afterward, in May 1933, the old organizations were completelydissolved. All organizational and professional activity was centered inthe National Socialist German Jurists League, which became one of themost important tools in the Nazi penal program.Hans Frank reported to Hitler in May 1933 that all existingprofessional organizations and associations of lawyers had joined theBNSDJ.[63]The cooperative entry of these organizations into the BNSDJ did not,however, imply individual membership of its members in the BNSDJ.This required an individual application. Actually by the end of 1934there was hardly a lawyer left who had not joined the BNSDJ. Thosevery few who had the courage to stay out laid themselves open asopponents of the regime with the grave risks which this implied. One ofthe conditions of membership in the BNSDJ was membership in the NaziParty, but non-Party members could be admitted as so-called supportingmembers (Foerdernde Mitglieder).The constitution of the BNSDJ dates from 4 May 1933. It declares asits program the realization of the National Socialist program in thelegal field. According to Hitlers order of 30 May 1933, the BNSDJwas the sole representative of the German Law Front and the exclusiveprofessional organization of all lawyers. The seat of the BNSDJ wasMunich, its leader Hans Frank, and its executive secretary Dr. WilhelmHeuber. Regionally, it was divided into 26 regions (Gaue). Leader ofthe Gaue Hanseatic Cities was the defendant Rothenberger. At the endof 1934, the Nazi organization of jurists had approximately 80,000individual members and its executive secretary could boast that it wasthe biggest lawyers organization in the world. In 1936, the name waschanged to Nationalsozialistischer Rechtswahrerbund (NSRB). Throughthe disciplinary boards of this organization, the legal chieftains ofthe Nazis held the lawyers under close political surveillance.                       c. Under the Third ReichWithin a short time after the advent of the Nazis, the editorship ofall legal journals was taken over by newly appointed Nazi editors,such as Hans Frank and his accomplices of the BNSDJ. A number of thescientific legal journals whose editors were known as anti-Nazis, suchas Die Justiz, were suppressed. The new editors perverted the legaljournals by turning them into mere propaganda instruments of the Nazigovernment. In these journals, the jurists were informed that they wereto be nothing but the legal soldiers of the Fuehrer. The legal journalswere flooded with such material. The Deutsche Justiz, the mouthpieceof the Ministry of Justice, frequently printed directives of which thefollowing by the late Under Secretary Freisler is typical:   But we will march as an army corps of the Fuehrer, and as such,   no one shall outdo us in the willingness to self-sacrifice! We   are alone responsible to the Fuehrer and that is our wish.[64]While, on the one hand, the legal thinking of the older generationof jurists was perverted, on the other hand the future Nazijurists received a thorough indoctrination at the law schools ofthe universities where they were instructed by Nazi lawyers or byopportunists who had sold their legal reputation for promotion withinthe Nazi hierarchy. Respected professors, who were suspected ofso-called Roman-Jewish individualistic legal ideas were discharged,and references to such ideas were eliminated from the textbooks. Thestandard of legal education was considerably lowered. The students hadto spend a considerable part of the time which was once devoted to thestudy of law, on compulsory labor and military service and exercises inthe student cadres of the SA Storm Troopers and the SS Elite Guards.During the period of their law clerkship, Nazi indoctrination andexercises in military formation were substituted for the once thoroughlegal training. Eventually, no young lawyer was admitted to the barwhom the examination board did not consider a reliable legal soldierof the Nazi Fuehrer. In analyzing the new Nazi examination decree forlawyers, Freisler stated:   The experience of the candidate within the (Nazi) movement and   its evaluation (by the Nazi movement) is fundamental in any   evaluation of the candidates qualifications. If such experience   does not exist, he will be disqualified.[65]In the early stages of this prostitution of German legal education, thePrussian Ministry of Justice took a leading part. The Prussian Ministerof Justice was a Nazi zealot named Hanns Kerrl, a budget clerk withoutlegal education who attained this high position under the Nazis, andwho became the Reich Minister for Churches after the Prussian Ministryof Justice was absorbed by the Reich government. In April 1933 Kerrlissued a decree concerning the selection of candidates for positionsas judges, public prosecutors, and attorneys in the State of Prussia,which provided in part that--   The applicant for appointment as a junior judge (assessor),   admission as attorney, or appointment as notary public   will in future have to prove in a special hearing that his   consciousness of being a member of the national community, his   social understanding, and his understanding of the entire race   development of the German people in the present and future   constitute the basis of his personality. * * * for this purpose   applicants will have to undergo a special post-examination which   has the aim to convey an impression of his being rooted in the   national community (Volksverbundenheit).   The result of this post-examination will be evaluated in   my decision about the appointment or qualifications of the   candidate equally with the other statutory requirements.[66]Two months later, Kerrl issued another decree which required thatall candidates for the final State legal examination had to attend aspecial Community Camp for 6 weeks before they would be admittedto the final examination. This Prussian decree provided, in part, asfollows:   The National Socialist State must know above all that the man   whom the State, as a sovereign, intends to entrust with the   execution of the most important tasks of judge or prosecutor,   must have character and be a typical German.   One cannot get an idea of this from an examination as it has   been conducted up to now, * * *.   I therefore decree that:   1. In the course of the final legal State examination, each   candidate, during the period following the written and preceding   the oral examination, that is for about 6 weeks, is to live   together with other candidates under the direction of civil   servants of the Prussian Administration of Justice, appointed by   me * * *.[67]This preposterous institution for the perversion of young lawyers wasestablished, and given the name Gemeinschaftslager Hanns Kerrl, afterits creator. It was located at Jueterbog, near Berlin. An illustratedpamphlet describing the activities in this lawyers madhouse will beintroduced in evidence. According to the basic statute of the camp,the inmates were to become familiar with the leadership principle andwould experience the ideas of the Fuehrer. The commandant of thecamp was a lawyer named Spieler, who had become favorably known to theNazis through his activities as defense counsel in their behalf. He wasan old Party member and a colonel in the Storm Troopers (SA). He wasassisted in supervision of the young lawyers by a motley group of stormtroopers and army officers. The extracts from this pamphlet will bearquotation:   A further training and examination of the candidate is   accomplished through ideological indoctrination. The camp   directors are aware, of course, that national socialism   can neither be learned nor taught. National socialism must   completely determine an individuals attitude; when this is   not the case, the individual can never become a real National   Socialist. There are many people, however, who in their social   relations or in their way of living have not become acquainted   with national socialism or were even opposed to it, yet in these   people there exists an unconscious National Socialist sentiment   which only needs stimulation to develop. The appropriate   method for this is the ideological indoctrination. The latter   is therefore particularly used in the camp, not only for this   purpose but also for training purposes, to strengthen and   develop the National Socialist ideology.          *       *       *       *       *       *       *   The day of Horst Wessels death was also a remarkable day.   This day was commemorated in a particular manner. At 4 oclock   a trumpeter blew reveille. At 4:07 all the camp inmates were   already assembled in the courtyard. A brief order, column   right, forward march. Then the various platoons of the school   took different routes across the drilling field and marched on   into the country.After the dissolution of the Prussian Ministry of Justice in 1934, theGemeinschaftslager Hanns Kerrl was brought under the supervision of theReich Ministry of Justice. The illustrated pamphlet to which I havejust referred contains photographs of Reich Minister Guertner, UnderSecretary Freisler, and others visiting the camp. The photographs alsoshow a gallows from which was suspended a symbol of German statutorylaw, the sign for the paragraphing of legal codes. Guertner and Kerrlare both photographed standing under the gallows. It would be hard toconceive a more appropriate symbol for the degradation of the legalprofession under the Third Reich.                              COUNT FOUR                 MEMBERSHIP IN CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONSGENERAL TAYLOR: The fourth and final count in the indictmentcontains the charge that seven of the defendants are guilty ofmembership in organizations declared to be criminal in the judgmentof the International Military Tribunal. Four of the defendants,Altstoetter, Cuhorst, Engert, and Joel are accused of membershipin the SS. The defendant Joel is also accused of membership in theSicherheitsdienst (commonly known as the SD). The defendant Cuhorstis also accused, together with three others, Oeschey, Nebelung, andRothaug, of membership in the Leadership Corps of the Nazi Party. Allthree of these organizations were declared criminal in the judgment ofthe International Military Tribunal.The legal basis of the charges in count four is quite distinct fromthat of the first three counts in the indictment. The charge derivesfrom article 9 of the Charter of the International Military Tribunal,which authorized that Tribunal, under specified circumstances, todeclare that certain groups or organizations were criminalorganizations. The prosecution before the International MilitaryTribunal sought such declarations in the case of each of the threeorganizations involved in count four of this indictment, and theInternational Military Tribunal rendered such declarations. In themeantime, it had been provided in article II of Control Council Law No.10 that membership in categories of a criminal group or organizationdeclared criminal by the International Military Tribunal shouldbe recognized as a crime. Paragraph 3 of article II of ControlCouncil Law No. 10 specifies the punishments which may be imposed formembership in such organizations.In its decision, the International Military Tribunal set forth certainlimitations upon the scope of its declaration that these organizationswere criminal.[68] Under these limitations, in order to rendermembership criminal, two things, in addition to membership, must beshown--   1. That the individual in question became or remained a member   of the organization after 1 September 1939, and   2. That the individual in question either (_a_) became or   remained a member with knowledge that it was being used for the   commission of acts declared criminal by article VI of the London   Agreement, or (_b_) was personally implicated as a member   of the organization in the commission of such crimes.The prosecution believes that, once it has established that a defendantwas a member of one or more of the criminal organizations, it isincumbent upon the defendant to come forward with evidence that heneither knew of the criminal activities of the organization, norparticipated in their commission, or that he ceased to be a memberprior to 1 September 1939. We believe that any question concerning theburden of proof will be entirely academic in this case, in as much asthe positions which these defendants held, and the evidence embodied inthe documents which we will offer in evidence will show beyond questionthat they both knew of and participated in the criminal activities.                        a. Membership in the SSI will deal first with the four defendants charged with membership inthe SS. The evidence will show that the defendant Altstoetter becamea member of the SS in 1937, that he remained a member after 1939, andattained the rank of Oberfuehrer (senior colonel) in June 1944. Thedefendant Cuhorst became a sponsoring member (Foerderndes Mitglied)of the SS in January 1934 and remained such after 1939. The defendantEngert joined the SS in 1936 and thereafter attained the rank ofOberfuehrer (senior colonel). The defendant Joel joined the SS in 1938,and attained the rank of Obersturmbannfuehrer (lieutenant colonel).The activities for which the SS was declared a criminal organizationare set forth in the judgment of the International MilitaryTribunal.[69] These activities included the extermination of numerousundesirable classes, including Jews, and the transfer of numerousJews and foreign nationals to concentration camps where they weremurdered and tortured.It will be abundantly apparent from the proof that if any member of theSS knew of, and participated in, its widespread criminal activities,surely these defendants did. They were directly concerned with penalproblems, and, as we have seen, of necessity their cooperation with theSS was extremely close. In fact, Himmler himself took special pains toinsure that the German judiciary would be fully advised on the ideologyof the SS and of its nefarious aims and purposes. In July 1944 at thespecial invitation of Thierack as Reich Minister of Justice, Himmlermade a speech to the presidents and the attorneys general of thecourts of appeal. A report from the files of the Ministry of Justicedescribing this occasion reads as follows:   On the invitation of the Reich Minister of Justice Dr.   Thierack, the Reich Leader SS, spoke to the presidents and the   attorneys general of the courts of appeal at the Reich Castle of   Cochem on 20 May 1944. The question of the development and the   aims of the SS was dealt with, in particular the importance of   the racial question, questions of national biology, fighting   selection, racial community, the importance of the Waffen SS   (armed SS) and the greater German concept.   The judges and public prosecutors were to receive the   information through the presidents of the courts of appeal and   might have been informed in the meantime.   You are respectfully requested to submit a detailed report on   the reception and the effect of this speech on the judges and   the chief public prosecutors.Himmlers well-known views on the value of non-German human life werethereby made available to all German judges and chief prosecutors.They surely came to the attention of the defendant Cuhorst, in thisand numerous other ways. They surely were well known among the higherofficials of the Ministry of Justice, including Altstoetter, Engert,and Joel.Indeed, long before Himmlers speech to this judicial assembly, theMinistry of Justice had been collaborating actively with Himmler inturning over Jews, Poles, Russians, gypsies, and others from theordinary prisons to the concentration camps. The whole evil processmust have been particularly well known to Engert, who was in charge ofDivision XV of the Ministry of Justice, which was charged with carryingout these transfers. A Justice Ministry document written in October1942 gives complete information concerning the agreement between theMinistry and Himmler, and specifically delegates the execution of theagreement, on behalf of the Ministry of Justice, to Engert and hisassociates in Division XV. Engert thereafter visited various prisonsthroughout the Reich, checked over the lists and arranged for thedelivery of these unfortunates to the SS.Nor could these arrangements, or other activities of the SS, have beenany secret from Altstoetter, who was a division chief of the Ministryof Justice throughout this period. Furthermore, Altstoetter was aparticular personal favorite of Himmlers. Correspondence which we willintroduce will show that the most cordial relations existed betweenAltstoetter and Himmler and between Altstoetter and other high SSofficers including Mr. Karl Gebhardt, the Chief Surgeon of the SS. Ata conference in 1942 with Thierack, Rothenberger, and other judicialofficials, Himmler singled out Altstoetter as being reliable. Thedefendant Joel was not only an officer of the SS, but also a memberof the Sicherheitsdienst, the branch of the SS particularly concernedwith intelligence and with the extermination of Jews in Poland andthe Soviet Union. Joel was particularly familiar with these murderousactivities. A memorandum signed by Joel in 1942 described a plan whichGoering had concocted for picking out daring fellows from amongthe prison inmates who would carry out special tasks behind the lineson the eastern front. Joels memo recites that Himmler had alreadyselected a large number of such men for his purpose, but that Goeringwanted the field picked over again. Joels memo goes on to state:    * * * the only suitable men are those with a passion for   hunting, who have poached for love of the trophy, not men who   have laid snares and traps. The Reich Marshal also mentioned   fanatical members of smuggling gangs, who take part in gun   battles on the frontiers, and whose passion it is to outwit the   customs at the risk of their own lives, but not men who attempt   to bring articles over the frontier in an express train or by   similar means.   The Reich Marshal Goering leaves it to us to consider whether   still other categories of convicts can be assigned to these   bands of pursuit commandos.   In the regions assigned for their operations, these bands   whose first task should be to destroy the communications of the   partisan groups could murder, burn, and ravish; in Germany they   would once again come under strict supervision * * *.           b. Membership in the Nazi Party Leadership CorpsThe defendant Cuhorst again, along with Nebelung, Oeschey, andRothaug, is involved in the charge of membership in the LeadershipCorps of the Nazi Party. The declaration of criminality rendered bythe International Military Tribunal includes all the leaders inthe hierarchy of the Nazi Party from the Reichsleiter down throughGauleiter and Kreisleiter, to Ortsgruppenleiter. It also includes theheads of the various staff organizations, down to the staffs of theKreisleiter.The evidence will show that Cuhorst became a member of the Nazi Partyin 1930 and in 1933 was given the status of Gaustellenleiter. Thedefendant Oeschey joined the Party in 1931 and in 1940 was given thestatus of Gauhaupstellenleiter. Rothaug joined the Party in 1938 andattained the status of Gaugruppenleiter. All three of these defendantswere therefore heads of staff organizations at Gau level. The defendantNebelung joined the Party in 1928 and soon thereafter became anOrtsgruppenleiter. All four of the defendants, therefore, fall withinthe categories of the Leadership Corps specified in the decision of theInternational Military Tribunal.The criminal activities of the Nazi Party Leadership Corps are also setforth in the judgment of the International Military Tribunal.[70] Theseincluded the persecution and extermination of Jews, administrationof the slave labor program, mistreatment of prisoners of war, and thelynching of airmen who had bailed out over Germany. The evidence whichwe will offer will show knowledge of and participation in all or mostof these activities by all four of the defendants.                              c. SummaryIn conclusion on count four, the prosecution wishes to point outcertain factors which it believes should be borne in mind inconsidering the degree of culpability to be attributed to membership inorganizations declared criminal by the International Military Tribunal.The charge of membership in these organizations, coupled with knowledgeof the crimes that were committed or participation in those crimes,is a very serious one. Its consequences will, we believe, have to bemore closely examined at the conclusion of this proceeding, but certainfactors can be pointed out here and now.It is true, for instance, that in a sense none of the seven defendantsinvolved in count four were full time or paid members of theseorganizations. All seven of them had full time jobs as judicialofficials but, under the circumstances which the evidence in this casewill disclose, we do not believe that this fact is significant inestimating culpability.It is true that the high officers ranks in the SS held by Altstoetter,Engert, and Joel were chiefly honorary. It was part of Himmlerscalculated policy to draw support to himself from all quarters bydistributing honorary SS ranks and decorations. But those who acceptedspecial ranks thereby lent the weight of their names and prestige toHimmler and to Himmlers policies. If they did not agree with thesepolicies, they prostituted themselves for whatever prerequisites orsecurity these shameful ranks and awards might bring.Where it can be shown, as it will be here, that the defendants notonly were fully familiar with the horrifying scope of Himmlersprogram, but also participated directly in its execution, it should beconsidered no defense whatsoever that an individuals SS activitieswere extracurricular rather than his daily bread and butter.Similar considerations apply to the defendants who were members of theParty Leadership Corps. Cuhorst, Nebelung, and Oeschey were all membersof the Party years before Hitler came to power; all three of them, andRothaug, too, played a leading role in Party affairs. They too, by thevery nature of the positions they occupied in the judicial system, tosay nothing of the fact that they were high in the Party councils, musthave been aware of the activities recited by the International MilitaryTribunal as the basis for its declaration of criminality.Indeed, the guilt of these seven defendants under count four is, inmany respects, deeper than that of many full-time officers of theseorganizations. The defendants were highly educated, professional men,and they had attained full mental maturity long before Hitlers rise topower. Their minds were not warped at an early age by Nazi teachings;they embraced the ideology of the Third Reich as educated adults. Theyall had special training and successful careers in the service of thelaw. They, of all Germans, should have understood and valued justice.                              ConclusionCrimes, theoretically and, more often than not, actually, are theseacts, which are so contrary to the moral conscience of the communityor so dangerous to the maintenance of a reasonable degree of order,justice and peace in the community, that the community, by appropriateprocesses, demands their elimination and suppression in the interestof the individuals who constitute the community. Therefore, thosewithin a nation or a state who institute proceedings to enforce thiscommunity decision as prosecutors, speak for the community conscienceor community decision. For this reason, criminal prosecutions withinstates or nations are brought in the name of the State or theCommonwealth, or by the use of words suitable to describe the offendedcommunity.In this proceeding at Nuernberg, the world is the community. Thefour nations which have written the substantive law under which weproceed, their responsible government heads and their elder statesmen,have proclaimed it as a codification of crimes denounced as such bythe moral conscience of that community where the crimes we try werecommitted.Therefore, although this indictment is brought in the name of theGovernment of the United States, this case in substance is the peopleof the world against these men who have committed criminal acts againstthe community we know as the world. For surely few spots on this earthare so remote that they have not felt in some degree the disruptive,if not indeed the destructive, impact of the criminal acts of thesemen or those others whom they served and with whose acts they werecriminally connected. Therefore, unless all the countries of the worldfight a continuous struggle to match the moral conscience of the worldwhich has been asserted here, the result will be a cynical Germany andan apathetic amoral world which drifts aimlessly because it sees nonational conduct which matches the standards of moral conduct which areproclaimed here. The true significance of these proceedings, therefore,far transcends the mere question of the guilt or innocence of thedefendants. They are charged with murder, but this is no mere murdertrial. These proceedings invoke the moral standards of the civilizedworld, and thereby impose an obligation on the nations of the world tomeasure up to the standards applied here.Although this Tribunal is internationally constituted, it is anAmerican court. The obligations which derive from these proceedingsare, therefore, particularly binding on the United States. True it isthat two wrongs do not make a right, and equally true that the crimescharged against these defendants and the other leaders of the ThirdReich were so calculating, so malignant, and so devastating thatthey find no modern parallel. But, underlying these crimes, there aremyths, superstitions, and more sophisticated distortions of philosophywhich do not know national boundaries. If we, of all nations fail torise above these malignant doctrines by actions which manifest a steadygrowth in national fiber and character, then all that we do here willcome to nothing, and will leave us and mankind an easy prey to theirnext violent eruption.We have still other obligations here which must not be overlooked.As was pointed out earlier, we have undertaken, together with othernations, the task of preparing for the eventual reconstruction ofGerman political life on a democratic basis and for eventual peacefulcooperation in international life in Germany.These proceedings are dedicated to that end. Punishment of theseleaders of Germany whose crimes made this task necessary is only a partof what we seek to accomplish here. We seek to resurrect the truthin Germany, and to reinvigorate those ideals that have been so longdesecrated. The people of Germany sense the need for this, but theywill measure our efforts by the measure of our own devotion to theideals which we proclaim.The United States cannot evade the challenge of these responsibilities.We can fulfill only the smallest part of them at Nuernberg.But Nuernberg must be a symbol, not of revenge or of smugself-satisfaction, but of peace and good will among nations andpeoples. It is the crime of shattering the foundations of peace anddenying the very fact of humanity that is charged in this and otherproceedings at Nuernberg. It is by trying these charges under law,and in quest of truth, that Nuernberg will find its full measure ofjustification.              B. Opening Statement for all Defendants[71]DR. KUBUSCHOK (counsel for defendant Schlegelberger, speakingon behalf of all the defendants): May it please the Tribunal. In thefollowing statements I shall briefly describe the manner in which thedefense believes, by summarizing the treatment of individual generalproblems, it will expedite the trial. My following statements are to beinterpreted in that sense.The prosecution views the development of justice in administration andjurisdiction during the period of the National Socialist State. Itlimits its reflections to this period and perceives in everything theconsequent execution of National Socialist totalitarian thought. Itbelieves to be able to reduce all phenomena to this denominator.It must be the task of the defense to extend the boundaries of thisreflection beyond this period. The defense will show that no newlegal system was created, and that no new system of jurisdiction wasdeveloped. Thus, the historical development which had been builton, also in the period from 1933 onward, must be presented in itsfundamental traits.The defense must also be aware of the difficulties encountered inthe treatment of the subject matter before a non-German court. Thedifference between the Anglo-American legal system and the Germanlaw, in accordance with which the acts of the German defendants arejudged, lies not only in the solution of individual legal questionsand problems, but is fundamental and systematic. Anglo-American lawappears to us vitally progressive by the effect which decisions ofthe highest courts carry in setting precedents. German law, on theother hand, is a codified law, much less suitable to development bythe administration of justice, but a law which in itself demandsobservance of the legal standard. The written law is inflexible. Newconcepts of the law cannot succeed in the administration of justiceas is the case in the gradual development of the common law. TheGerman--as well as the continental--principle of the codified lawpermits the incorporation of new legal concepts only through suddenchanges [sprunghafte Veraenderungen] of the written law. Thus thesupplementary laws of the penal code in force in Germany since 1877show an abrupt change at shorter or longer intervals. For this reasonthe positivism of law has played a far more important part in Germanysince the end of the nineteenth century than has been the case in legalsystems outside the continent. Only the written law [statutory law]and not general ideas on morals and rights constituted the directivefor administration of law and justice. Also in Germany this principleof absolute codification has, with regard to its expediency, been theobject of legislative discussion for some time. Finally, in 1935,it culminated in the amendment of article 2 of the penal code, andthus, a synthesis was found between codified law and the developmentof law as interpreted by the decision of the judge; and historicalreflection on this event will show the inaccuracy of the prosecutionsconclusion that, being instituted during the period of the NationalSocialist State, it must of need be the product of National Socialistthinking and its corresponding political aim. We shall prove that thefundamental basis for this norm was created by plans for reform draftedlong before 1933, and that the necessity of supplying the judge witha means, enabling him to counterbalance the defects of an absolutelycodified law to a limited degree by analogous application of a penalregulation had been realized long before that. It was recognized thatthe multiformity of life, the constant change of its forms with regardto social, political and economic aspects could not be regulated bycodified law alone; especially so, because codified law always laggedone step behind the case in need of settlement of law. Such cases couldnot, as is possible in common law, be regulated and decided on bygeneral concepts of law; they merely gave cause for establishing newlegal standards. This one example already reveals the necessity ofdealing with the existing German legal system and with plans for reformentertained in Germany for decades.German law will form the basis for all considerations. We will,therefore, also have to deal with constitutional law and the techniqueof legislation. We shall proceed from the provisions of the Weimarconstitution. We shall observe there the legislative functions ofthe Reichstag, the Reichsrat [Council of the Reich] and the ReichPresident. It will be shown that, since Bruening was Reich Chancellor,the weight of legislation shifted in ever increasing measure toward theright of the Reich President to issue emergency decrees.The turning point was formed by the Enabling Act [Ermaechtigungsgesetz]of 24 March 1933 which represents the basis for all future legislation.The cabinet was now empowered to pass laws on its own authority andeven the right of the Reich President to draft and promulgate laws wasabandoned. Thus, under consideration of article 56 of the constitutionwhich allocated powers of policy determination to the Reich Chancellor,the right to legislate was practically conferred upon Reich ChancellorHitler who, in the absence of time, made increasingly extensive use ofit. The lawful passing of a law and its legal effects will necessarilybe the subject of presentation.Thus, we are faced with the legal problem of the binding effect of theFuehrer order. It will have to be examined whether this Fuehrer orderwas a literal order in the meaning of the Control Council Law, theeffect of which is not to be looked upon as exempting from guilt, or,at the most as mitigating, or, whether we are not dealing here with alegislative act, to which this provision of the Control Council Lawdoes not apply.We shall have to deal with the entire legislative machinery as it wasdeveloped at that time. It will be shown that meetings of the cabinettook place even after Hitlers cabinet had been formed, that they were,however, of an essentially different character already than formerly.Questions were no longer put to the vote. In individual questions oflegislation too, Hitler stood on his right as Reich Chancellor todetermine directives of policy, in accordance with article 56 of theconstitution. As Hitlers position grew stronger, especially after, inAugust 1934, the positions of Reich Chancellor and President of theReich had been combined in his person, cabinet meetings served actuallyonly the purpose of issuing Hitlers instructions. In accordancewith instructions, members of the cabinet were to submit bills thatconcerned their departments. In accordance with Hitlers request thesebills were submitted to other participating members of departmentsprior to the cabinet meetings, in order to obtain their opinion and atthis stage only objections with regard to departmental competency ofother ministries were taken into consideration. The bill, thus havingbecome ripe for the cabinet [kabinettreif] was then passed in thecabinet meeting without debate. Since the uselessness of the cabinetmeetings thereby became obvious, they were discontinued completely in1937. Laws were then legislated by means of a so-called circulationprocedure [Umlaufsverfahren] in which the individual ministers weregiven opportunity to voice their objections. These objections could,however, deal with purely departmental aspects only, whereas objectionsagainst a basic political idea founded on one of Hitlers instructionscould not be raised or remained ineffective. As we will show, thishad, at the same time, the effect of declassifying certain ministriesand resulted in their being subordinated to other ministries. Thisstarted already in 1935. By the secret National Defense Law, theOKW, [High Command of the Armed Forces], the Minister of Economicsas Plenipotentiary General for the Economy, and the Minister of theInterior as Plenipotentiary General for the Administration of theReich, were brought into prominence as legislative bodies and werecombined in Board of Three [Dreierkollegium]. The other Ministrieswere subordinated to them and depended on them for instructions. TheMinistry of Justice was subordinate to the Plenipotentiary Generalfor the Administration of the Reich and was permitted to presentbills only through him. The Ministry of Justices signature on a lawwas therefore only of nominal significance; it indicated that thejudicial departments had been concerned with the contents of thelaw. We will show that after the outbreak of the war the MinisterialCouncil for National Defense was added as legislative body to theBoard of Three. Here too, the Ministry of Justice was subordinated tothe Plenipotentiary General for the Administration of the Reich, whowas a member of the Ministerial Council for National Defense. Billswere drafted in accordance with his instructions. If the initiativefor drafting a bill came from the Ministry of Justice itself thePlenipotentiary General for the Administration of the Reich had toconcur in the matter.To judge the position of the individual defendant in the Ministry,a detailed presentation of the organization of the judicialadministration becomes necessary. We must deal with the problem ofsubordination of the various offices in their relations with eachother. In particular, the defense will attempt to give the Tribunala picture of the actual workings of the Ministry of Justice. Withinthe framework of a bureaucratic organization the sphere of activityof a minister, an under secretary, division chiefs, subdivisionchiefs, a Referenten, and co-workers [Mitarbeiter], will be definedand certain organizational changes wrought in the course of timewill be taken in consideration. The scope of authority pertainingto the superior-subordinate relationship is also of importance. Ofequal importance are the limits of signing power fixed for eachindividual official of the Ministry of Justice as well as the degreeof responsibility he assumed whenever he affixed his signature. Asignature does not always imply the assumption of a responsibilitynor does it always signify that someone in particular was chargedwith the handling or discharging of a specific task. A document hasquite frequently been submitted to an official of the Ministry ofJustice for the sole purpose of having him take official notice ofits contents, i.e., the only object being to apprise the officialin question of some measure or other. This method of passing oninformation, of course, could serve many other purposes which remainto be discussed. A simple request, however, to take official notice,combined with an accompanying acknowledgment of receipt signed by anofficial, never meant that the official had, by affixing his signature,assumed responsibility for the matter on hand. Finally, there remainsthe problem of throwing light upon the relationship existing betweenindividual departments of the Ministry of Justice and that of definingthe meaning and aim of a cosignature. The act of cosigning indicatedprimarily that the subject matter and its treatment as viewed in thelight of the cosigners own field of activity, i.e., from an expertspoint of view alone, gave rise to no objections.A study of departmental limitations will afford insight into thenature of the judiciary in its relationship with, and its dependencyon, other Reich Ministries and Party offices. An understanding of thereciprocal connection between the Ministry of Justice and the ReichMinistry of the Interior, as well as the limitations imposed uponboth will yield enlightening information on many questions. We shallalso find these necessary connections with other Ministries existingbefore 1933 and thereby refute the assumption of the prosecution thatthese intersectional connections which are to be found in any systemof government constitute a creation of the Nazis and were adoptedby them for the purpose of achieving their own ends. It will benecessary, in this connection, not only to discuss the strictly legalaspects involved, but also to show what the actual conditions werewith respect to power and authority. We will have to reconstruct theevents as they occurred at that time in a state under dictatorship andshow what legal consequences a necessary examination conducted fromthe viewpoint of constitutional law will yield. The question will beraised as to what would have been the consequences of a failure tocomply with an order, and would obedience, therefore, legally excludeguilt. A factor of great importance in considering that problem is thedetermination of the relationship between the judiciary and the police.The effective role played by Himmler, as chief of the entire policeforce, must also be taken into consideration. The full presentation offacts will show how the police interloped in affairs of the judiciary,and how this interference led, during the course of the years, to anappreciable weakening of the position held by the judiciary. We shallsee what means were and had to be employed to fight that battle. Thecontrast between the position of the justice administration which wasweak by nature and that of the police which was equipped with allthe instruments of power it employed ruthlessly through the officesof Himmler and Hitler will become manifest. Again and again one willperceive how the judiciary was confronted with accomplished facts,how it strove to defend or recapture lost ground, how all of itsactivities, as a matter of fact, were overshadowed by the constantpressure and expansionistic aims brought into play by the police. Itwill be shown how everyone in the Ministry sought to retain as a lastbulwark the concept of the constitutional state for practical usage.It will be brought out how the police, beginning with the protectivecustody order and ending up with the establishment of its own preservein the concentration camps and the subsequent creation of its ownSS jurisdiction over its members finally secured their exemptionfrom the judiciary. Yet in spite of the constant rivalry between thejudiciary and the police we must not lose sight of the fact thatcertain contacts between both offices had to be maintained becauseof the very nature of German criminal procedure. Since the judiciaryhad no investigation agencies of its own, it was dependent upon thecooperation of the police in that respect. Finally, I shall also showhow Himmler attempted to wrest all public prosecutor offices from thejustice administration for systematic absorption by his police machine,although he did not succeed in doing so. When the unique position heldby the judiciary within the entire administrative system is made clearin the presentation, one will become aware of the difficulties of thesituation in which the judiciary found itself in this battle. We needbut have a clear conception of the difference in denotation of theterms dictatorship and justice in order to gain an appreciationof the difficulties of that situation. The dictatorship derived bothstimulus and pattern from the Party in its manifold manifestations. Wewill show up the predominance and influence of the Party offices, someof which were legally established, and demonstrate how both expanded inall directions and by the employment of any and all means through theperson of the Fuehrer of the Party, namely the dictator.The defense will show, at the proper time, how the Party sought to pushits interests ruthlessly in opposition to the judiciary. The activitiesof the Party constituted a perpetual obstacle to the progressiveadministration of justice. It will be shown how the Gauleiter, eitherdirectly or indirectly through Bormann, deliberately added fuel toHitlers repugnance against the judiciary and thereby shoved the ReichMinistry of Justice into a spot similar to that of an isolated animalat bay.The various aspects just outlined will also furnish us with abroad foundation for those laws to which objections were raised inthe indictment, and the substance of which we shall subject to anexhaustive examination.We will show, when dealing with the problem of violation of theprinciple _nullum crimen sine lege_, that all those laws withwhich the indictment is concerned and which had been made retroactivedo not furnish a basis for punishment. The punishable offense itself,to which they referred, had already been made punishable by laws inforce at the time the deed was committed.The _rules_ of penal laws were not only already part and parcelof the general body of law, but had also been fixed long before byvirtue of positive law at the time the appropriate supplementary lawswent into effect. In every instance revisions were applied only to theevaluation of a crime in relation to the amount of punishment. Sincethe prescribed rules of the German Penal Code, generally speaking, didnot allow a judge much leeway in awarding punishment, it was foundnecessary to provide for changes with regard to the fixing of penalties.We will show that conditions of public distress in Germany were ineach instance responsible for the changes and, furthermore, that theselegislative measures were, above all, inspired by criminologicalpropositions that had played an important part in scientificdiscussions long before 1933. We will also show that the drafting ofsuch legislative measures was strongly influenced by the knowledge andexperience of other countries.We shall have to proceed from the assumption that a retroactive measurecharacterized only by an increase in severity of punishment does notconstitute a violation of the principle _nullum crimen sine lege_according to common German continental legal conceptions.If the prosecution should construe the substance of various laws ascrimes against humanity, we will have to enter into an investigationof the actual living conditions which gave rise to the necessity forthe legislation of strict measures. One of the cardinal determinantsof any system of penal law is the principle of the deterrent influenceof punishment. Variations in the forms and uses of deterrents are atall times dictated by circumstances. Thus, when living conditionseverywhere are at high tension, deterrents, if they are to be effectiveat all, must be accompanied by a corresponding increase in severity oflegislative measures.Some of the legal terms found in German court decisions that are tobe examined by the Court will require explanation. Such terms asdangerous habitual criminal, perpetrators of crimes of violence,juvenile major criminals, public enemies, asocials, and criminaltype [Taetertyp]. In defining these terms it will become apparentthat they were used as necessary aids in the quest for laws and thatthey represented, by no means, a one-sided attempt at increasing theharshness of measures in the administration of justice. These termswere established for the purpose of setting up clear-cut, definableboundary lines encompassing a definite group of major criminals. Sucha move paved the way for pronouncements of restricted judgments, i.e.,less severe ones upon those who did not fall within that group.In answer to the question of sterilization, we shall outline itshistorical development in Germany and other countries both in theoryand practice. We will find that sterilization, as a program, wasadvocated long before 1933 in Germany and even found champions inSocialist and church groups. Closer examination of the law underconsideration will reveal the great care and caution exercised inhedging in its specific provisions. Should the law itself, however,lie beyond the pale of any possible extensive explanation, we shallthen furnish proof that it has never been misapplied for political orrace-political purposes.The subject of euthanasia will be dealt with at length and judged withfairness and justice. We will show that the measures originated withHitler himself, and in the Chancellery of the Fuehrer. We will alsoshow--and this is symptomatic of the position held by the judiciaryin the administration--that the judiciary did not receive word ofthe existence of those measures directly but in trailing stagesfrom outside sources. We will bring out how the Ministry of Justiceattempted to thwart the execution of those measures, and then disclosehow those same attempts led to a premature discontinuance of theprogram. In order to decide the question of whether the judiciary isresponsible for these measures, which they neither caused to be putin effect nor carried out, we again must consider the actual existingfacts.A trial which concerns verdicts rendered by various courts calls fora study of the organization of these courts as well as their mannerof functioning. We will deal with the structure of the Special Courtsand of the Peoples Court as well as the courts before them. We willconsider whether the Special Courts are extraordinary courts in thesense of the indictment, which were prohibited by the constitution.We will also define the term extraordinary court, and we shall seethat a court which has not been established for the purpose of bringingcertain persons to trial, but for the purpose of passing judgment oncertain punishable acts cannot be considered an extraordinary court.The legal regulations which are prescribed for proceedings in SpecialCourts and which deviate from regulations prescribed for regularproceedings will be scrutinized with regard to extent and purpose. Wewill deal with the structure of the Peoples Court in like manner.In order to discuss these questions, it will also be necessary to givethe Tribunal a clear-cut, plastic picture of German criminal procedure.We hope to be able to achieve this by interrogating an expert onthe characteristic features of German criminal procedure. Thus, wewill be able to show the fundamental differences between German andAnglo-American criminal procedure. We will become acquainted with thepreliminary proceedings as well as with the actual main proceedings.Preliminary proceedings are in the hands of the public prosecutor. Thenecessary investigations to ascertain the facts of the case must becarried out with the aid of the police and through its own or judicialinterrogations. The public prosecutor is bound by law to an objectiveconsideration of the matter. The prosecutor in so doing of courserepresents the instance which later on submits the indictment in court;yet he is under obligation to draw up the indictment not as an agentof an interested party, which he will represent later on in the mainproceedings, but as a purely objective agent engaged in clearing up thefacts of the case. He is also charged with procuring and submittingfacts which serve the purpose of the defense. After the facts of thecase have been established in this manner and the transcript of theinterrogations of the defendant, the witnesses, and the experts aswell as the record on any inspections, seizures, or searches have beenrecorded to the court, then the public prosecutor draws up a writtenindictment and submits to the court the documents which contain theentire material collected by him with the request that a date be setfor the trial. In considering the question whether action should bebrought, or whether proceedings should be quashed beforehand, he musttake into consideration whether the findings are sufficient to justifythe suspicion that a punishable act has been committed. This questionwill then be examined by the court, which has to decide on the openingdate of the trial. If, in the opinion of the court, the findings aslaid down in the documents are not sufficient to warrant a convictionof the accused, then the court may decide against instituting trialor it may request the public prosecutor to collect further material,which will be of an exonerating nature also. After the trial has beenordered, the proceedings are entirely in the hands of the judge, and inthe case of the courts attended by several judges [Kollegialgerichten],in the hands of the presiding judge. By studying the documents, thecourt finds out how the preliminary proceedings were conducted aswell as the results obtained. However, except in a few instances, thecourt may make use of the preliminary proceedings for informationalpurposes only, so to speak, only as a jumping-off point for the mainproceedings, which alone are decisive for the final decision. Inthese main proceedings the oral principle alone applies. Only thatwhich is presented at these proceedings by the defendant himself, bywitnesses, experts, and documents can be considered by the court inpassing judgment, but not the interrogation transcript of the policeor the public prosecutor. The presiding judge guides the proceedings.He examines the defendant who can make statements pertaining to thecase in question, but who may not take the stand as a witness as is thecase in American proceedings and who can also not be sworn in. Shouldthe public prosecutor or the counsel for the defense desire to askquestions of the defendant, they may do so only through the presidingjudge. The examination of the defendant is followed by the hearingof the witnesses and of the experts. This is also carried on by thejudge. The public prosecutor and the defense counsel have the rightto put pertinent questions to the witnesses and to the experts, whichthe judge must permit in accordance with the regulations within theframework of the code of criminal procedure.The role played by the counsel for the defense must be described indetail. In comparison with his role in the Anglo-American procedure,he is not so important here. Whereas in Anglo-American proceduresthe prosecution as well as the defense, so to speak as two parties,submit their case for the decision of the court, in German proceduresthe investigation of the facts of the case in the trial, the rulesconcerning the extent of evidence to be collected, the serving ofsummons to witnesses for the prosecution and defense, without theprosecution or the defense filing any requests, are in the hands of thecourt. According to that, the public prosecutor and the counsel for thedefense in reality only support the court in investigating the factsof the case, which is the duty of the court itself. Because of thisrole played by the counsel for the defense, it follows that in Germancriminal proceedings the defendant is represented by a counsel only ina comparatively small percentage of cases, and in all the other casesthe defendant just does not employ a counsel for his defense.The question regarding the contesting of a verdict rendered by a courtof first instance demands thorough clarification. In this connection,we will demonstrate the meaning and the purpose of the nullity pleaand of the extraordinary objection. We will prove that it was notNational Socialistic thinking in terms of violence [Gewaltdenken]which gave rise and impulse to their introduction, but ratherconsiderations regarding the technique of procedure. By extending thecompetency of such courts, which had to decide only in one instance,the necessity arose for a higher instance to be able to take careof reviewing decisions. To be sure, considerably eased regulationsregarding the review of verdict rendered by special courts had alreadybeen introduced when these courts were first established. However,these regulations proved by providing a resumption of proceedings[Wiederaufnahme des Verfahrens] insufficient in practice, particularlyafter it became evident that economic offenses called for uniformlaws throughout Germany. Considerable divergence insofar as thelegal interpretation of the new laws was concerned and with regardto the meting out of punishment became apparent in the procedure ofthe different courts, through a constant surveillance, which becameespecially necessary in view of the changing economic conditions. Toobtain uniformity in this respect, new opportunities for additionallegal redresses were created. We shall demonstrate that the nullityplea is a method of procedure which has been taken over from theformer Austrian law. The diversity in legal conceptions concerning theprinciple of _ne bis in idem_ [double jeopardy] with regard tolegal remedies will be treated in this respect.The indictment also makes it necessary for us to decide how far astate may and can consider itself competent to extend its power topunish [Strafgewalt] acts committed abroad. Is it consistent withinternational law to prosecute foreigners for punishable acts committedabroad? The extent to which a state may take it upon itself to takeaction for acts committed abroad depends on whether such stateinclines toward the principle of personality [Personalitaetsprinzip],the principle of territoriality [Territorialitaetsprinzip], theprinciple of protective law [Schutzrechtsgrundsatz], or the principleof universal law [Weltrechtsgrundsatz]. As can be seen from a studyof comparative law and from the history of law, diverse and variableopinions are held about this in the different countries, and thescience of international law after the First World War shows this inparticular. We shall point out the basic principles which are containedin sections 3 and 4 of the Penal Code of 1870, and we shall find againin the Supplementary Law (Novelle) of 6 May 1940, which extends thesphere of authority of the penal law, and which is now being assailedby the prosecution, ideas drafted for the reform of the penal lawconceived long before 1933. Article 153a of the Code of CriminalProcedure is, to a certain degree, intended to act as a safety valveagainst a too exaggerated application, and has in fact greatly reducedprosecutions, and it shall be dealt with in this context.The discussion on the introduction of German law and the establishmentof German courts in the Protectorate will cover the three decreesof the Ministry of Justice, which were also issued as a result of adecree published by Hitler in the form of a law, and an ordinancesupplementing this decree, both of which were not countersigned bythe Reich Ministry of Justice. In this connection, it is necessary toclarify the international relations existing between the so-calledProtectorate and the German Reich. Are we concerned with a bilateralinternational treaty negotiated between Hacha and Hitler, anintervention, an annexation, or an occupation? From the subjectivepoint of view, what the German public and what the defendants actuallyknew about conditions then prevailing will be decisive in each case.We shall have to discuss here and at other occasions--and this is notdependent on the above--whether within the scope of the indictmentconcerning a crime against humanity, the actually selected form oflegislation and administration of justice is not also justified inits scope under different international conditions. Can one, to givean example, consider it inhuman if members of the Protectorate weresubjected to the provisions of the German Criminal (Penal) Coderegarding treason and high treason, if the provisions of the lawgoverning occupied territories would also have justified the samepenalties for aiding and abetting a hostile army?With regard to the introduction of German law in the Easternterritories we must first of all consider that they were essentiallydivided into the following three groups, namely:   1. Territories which were part of the Union of Soviet Republics   after September 1939;   2. The so-called Congress Poland [Kongresspolen], the principal   part of the Polish Republic, which was administered under the   designation of Government General, and finally;   3. The western parts of Poland, which before 1918 were made   up mainly of the German provinces of Poznan, Upper Silesia,   and other small parts of provinces. German jurisdiction was   introduced only in areas mentioned under 3, and they were   designated as Incorporated Eastern Territories. The former   Russian territories mentioned under 1 were subordinate to the   military and civilian governors, and the Government General   mentioned under 2 to Governor General Dr. Frank. Both these   groups were completely outside the administrative competency, or   even the sphere of influence, of the Reich Ministry of Justice.If, therefore, we have to concern ourselves with the question of theintroduction of German jurisprudence only in the so-called IncorporatedEastern Territories, then we shall call attention to a point of viewwidespread in science and actual application, whereby a declarationof war renders treaties [staatsrechtliche Vertraege] meaninglessbetween the parties at war. Not only was this point of view especiallyadvocated in a detailed justification by the Reichsgericht, as theGerman Supreme Court, already after 1918, but it was also championedin French works on international law, as for instance in FoignetsDroit International Public [International Public Law]. It will be shownthat other states have in fact also accepted this point of view. Therecognition that this viewpoint concerning international relations wasactually followed in practice will be shown by an agreement concludedbetween Germany and the Soviet Union, which pertains to judicialprocedure in civilian matters in Polish territories incorporated intothe Soviet Union in 1940.The answer to the question--which has already come up many timesduring the examination of witnesses by the Court--namely the question,whether it was permissible to apply the criminal ordinance for Poles[Polenstrafrechtsverordnung] also to those Poles who did not come toGermany of their own volition, will depend on whether we consider theintroduction of German jurisdiction in the above-mentioned extentadmissible. I dont believe that the evidence presented by theprosecution covers a case which proves that a Pole who did not cometo Germany voluntarily, was sentenced. Generally speaking however, wewill have to take into consideration the fact that the Pole who came toGermany was subject to that law which then applied in his former placeof residence.So that the jurisdiction in so-called Night and Fog [Nacht undNebelsachen--NN] cases, can be judged, we shall put in evidence thatin the main the military courts alone were competent. Section 3,paragraph 2, of the Decree for Military Jurisdiction During Wartime[Kriegsstrafverfahrensordnung] formed the legal basis for handing overthose cases to the general courts. This decree concerning militaryjurisdiction during wartime and special operations was issued on 17August 1938, and published in the Reich Law Gazette 1939, part I, page1457. It was only signed by the Fuehrer and Reichskanzler and by theChef des Oberkommandos der Wehrmacht [Chief of the Supreme Command ofthe Armed Forces].This decree fixes the scope of military jurisdiction and subordinatesall foreigners and Germans to this military jurisdiction for allcriminal offenses committed by them in the area of operations.According to section 3, paragraph 2, of this decree, military courtshowever are to prosecute such crimes only if it is judged necessaryfor military reasons. It is within their discretion to turn over theprosecution of criminal cases to the general courts.On the basis of this legal foundation, and in accordance with anagreement between the Chief of the Armed Forces Legal Department, Dr.Lehmann--who has appeared here before the Tribunal as witness--and theformer Under Secretary Dr. Freisler, prisoners held in Night and Fogcases were placed before a German court in the sense of paragraph 30 ofthe Hague Regulations on Land Warfare.The fact that the proceedings [of an NN case] were kept secret in allits phases was justified for military reasons. According to paragraph 6of the basic treaty of the Hague Regulations on Land Warfare, militaryinterests come first, and then comes the protection of the civilianpopulation. The administrators of justice could not decide about thescope of the military interests. It could never be the task of thecivilian judicial authorities to judge whether the military commanderscorrectly interpreted the competition of military necessity in thesense of subparagraph 8 of the introduction to the basic treaty of theHague Regulations on Land Warfare.Within the framework of these military necessities we will also clarifythe motive of intimidation which follows from this. A deterrent could,according to the views of the parties concerned, be achieved onlyby the severest punishment, with a judgment in the enemy country.The legal basis for this was given without more ado in accordancewith those existing provisions of military law which correspond tointernational law. It concerned cases throughout which can be punishedwith death, according to general military law, such as espionage,sabotage, aid and comfort to the enemy, and illegal possession of arms.Is it then a violation of the law of humanity if allowance was madefor the principle of a deterrent in another manner, and standards wereintroduced into the proceedings before the courts in Germany which,regarded absolutely, are attacked by the prosecution, but which havebeen introduced here to avoid an administration of justice which wouldpronounce the death sentence excessively? We will prove that in theproceedings before the Night and Fog courts, sentences of imprisonmentwere pronounced in an overwhelming proportion, and that the quota ofdeath sentences was very small. It will be clearly shown that thedeviations from the normal proceedings which were shown by the Nightand Fog proceedings were all conditioned by the principle of secrecy.A full consideration of German criminal procedure will show that manylimitations in the leading principles of German criminal procedure meaneither no disadvantage at all, or at any rate merely a far lower degreeof disadvantage than it may appear to a person accustomed to thinkingonly along American principles of procedure.Article 3, paragraph 2 of the Rules of Military Criminal Procedurewill also prove that the Night and Fog prisoners had been handed overto the civil authorities only for the purpose of the execution of thecriminal proceedings, and that moreover the power of disposal overthese prisoners was reserved for the offices of the Wehrmacht.When we see that the Night and Fog proceedings had been taken overby the judicial administration by virtue of an order of the Fuehrerand by virtue of the delegation of the military authorities competenttherefor, the question of the relationship of international law to theGerman State law will also be submitted for consideration. The Germanscience of political and international law has always unanimouslyadvocated the view that state law takes precedence over internationallaw. This would be of significance in each case for the question of aconsciousness of injustice on the part of the defendants.The prosecution has also concerned itself with lynch justice[Lynchjustiz]. The defense will present documents proving that thejudicial authorities criminally prosecuted, in spite of the violentopposition of the Gauleiter concerned, Germans who had mistreatedor shot Allied fliers forced to abandon their planes, and thatthey protected Germans who treated such Allied fliers humanely.This positive attitude of the judicial offices will constitute anillustration of the relations of the powers [Machtverhaeltnisse] atthat time. The Party and the police in their attitude were opposedto each other. The leader of the Party Chancellery had ordered allState and Party offices not to interfere with the execution of lynchjustice on Allied fliers. The Minister of Justice could not ignorethis order. He applied it in a manner that could be interpreted asquashing the proceedings. This weakening of an order instigated by theParty and the cases in practice mentioned show here, too, the basictendency in the consideration of the actual relation of the powers.Arguments from the aspect of reprisal will also be made, which aresupplementary to the question of lynch justice.The German Law of Pardons needs also to be presented and dealt within detail, since it represents the basis, after all, for the properevaluation of numerous documents presented by the prosecution,including the report lists of the Reich Ministry of Justice in mattersof the death sentence. It has been fully codified, and we will refer tothe numerous legal provisions. The entire system of pardon will justifythe statement that it was most painstakingly built up with every safetymeasure and must withstand any criticism as a system. The law of pardonwas incumbent upon the head of the State. Hitler transferred hisexecutive power to Reich Minister Thierack, even for death sentences,whereas the latters predecessor in office, Reich Minister Guertner,and after his death, Under Secretary Schlegelberger, were restrictedin the execution of the law of pardon in that they could recommend toHitler to pardon a person sentenced to death, but they themselves couldnot pardon a person. What resulted is necessarily an orientation towardthe utmost which could be obtained from Hitler. The manner they usedand how the whole tendency on the part of the participating offices wasto exhaust fully the possibilities for pardon which were offered willbe shown in the evidence.From the individual provisions we will see that in matters of deathsentences, for example, the Oberstaatsanwalt, regardless of whetherthe condemned person had personally submitted a petition for pardon,had to make a thorough report on the question of pardon after he firstgathered the attitude of the court, the presiding judge, the prisonauthorities, the police, and still other offices prescribed in specialcases. This report goes to the Generalstaatsanwalt who on his part mustthen state in detail his attitude about the pardon report. In the ReichMinistry of Justice, special Referenten had been appointed for dealingwith pardon questions. These Referenten were supported by numerousco-workers. The co-worker had to present an opinion with an exactreport of the facts, an opinion on the legal question of the individualcase, a criticism of the judgment with regard to the factual and legalaspects, and a detailed statement on the question of pardon. TheReferent, on his part, as well as the division chief, had to add theirattitude to this opinion. Only if all reporting offices, the co-worker,the Referent, and the division chief unanimously recommended thatthe sentence be carried out was the matter designated as a so-calledsmooth affair [glatte Sache]. In this case the Referent in charge ofdeath sentences reported personally to the Minister, calling specialattention to all the circumstances of the case worth remarking on.On the other hand, even if one of all these participants recommendedcommuting the death sentence to a prison sentence, then the co-workerhad to present his detailed opinion in person to the Minister; and theReferent, the division chief, and the under secretary stated theirattitude at the request of the Minister.The same procedure was also used in principle in cases of so-calledimmediate execution [Blitzvollstreckung]. This concerned cases from thelast years of the war, in which the facts of the case and the legalquestion to be decided on were straightforward; moreover, it concernedcases in which, on account of the fact that the deed had causedconsiderable stir among the public, a special deterrent effect shouldbe obtained by carrying out the sentence as soon as possible after thedeed had been committed and judged. The only difference in dealingwith these immediate executions and the usual procedure was that allreports and opinions were given by telephone, telegraph, teletype, orverbally, and on account of its being a straightforward case no fileswere submitted.The indictment also contains the charge that the amnesty laws wereadministered according to political view. The provisions in questionwill be discussed in detail when the evidence is presented.Hitlers constitutional right to quash pending criminal proceedings[Abolitionsrecht] will be shown in its practical meaning.Regarding the carrying-out of sentences we will deal with the legalprovisions and the regulations applicable in penal institutions. Thedefense will prove that no crimes against humanity were committed inpenal institutions of justice by its officials with the exceptionof occasional violations which are unavoidable even under the bestdirections. The rules of the strict legal provisions of the GermanPenal Law against the ill-treatment of prisoners will emphasize thispoint. The cases mentioned which date from the last days before thecollapse offer, as a singular sign of that moment, no basis for ageneral judgment of the German execution of punishment and will bereferred to as each individual case comes up.The action of the Spruchrichter dealt with in the indictment andthe charges raised in this connection will bring the legal positionof the German judge up for discussion. We shall see the judge as anindependent official who is not bound to directives but only to thelaw. We will discuss the positivism of the German interpretation oflaw. We will deal with the prosecutions charges arising from thedirecting regulations. We will show that they are merely a referenceto the motive and aims of the law in question, and that they, tosome extent, give a clear conception of the policy of the legislatorregarding crime. They are a clue to the way in which the legislatorimagines punishment should be awarded by the judge. They are in no casea general directive or a directive pertaining to an individual case.In dealing with the position of the public prosecutors we will referto the principle of legality which is laid down by law, and accordingto which the public prosecutor was bound to prefer a charge as soon asthere was sufficient suspicion that the criminal facts as laid down ina legal provision existed.In conclusion the defense will also deal with the legal questions,arising from Control Council Law No. 10 itself. We know that theTribunal has been called together in order to pass judgment on thebasis of this law.On the basis of this actual fact and in compliance therewith, we willfor practical reasons refrain from repeating the relevant objectionsalready raised in the proceedings before the IMT and other proceedingsbefore similar Tribunals in session. On account of these considerationswe will restrict ourselves to the real legal questions as to whetheran indictment is permissible from the point of view of conspiracy inwar crimes and crimes against humanity of Control Council Law No.10. In this respect my colleague, Dr. Haensel, will provide detailedstatements hereon in due course.At the beginning of the evidence for the defense and in connectionwith the opening statements on behalf of the individual defendants,the defense intends to call in two experts for the legal questionsof general interest, namely Dr. Jahrreiss, Professor of Public andInternational Law at the University of Cologne, and Dr. Niethammer ofTuebingen, formerly attorney at law, now Honorary Professor of CriminalLaw and Criminal Procedure.As far as documents being introduced with regard to the generalquestions discussed--We will not be able to produce Dr. Jahrreiss at this time. ProfessorJahrreiss cannot get away; he will only be available later on in July,and perhaps a suitable moment will come then when he can be examinedwhen we have dealt with the cases of the officials of the Ministry ofJustice.[72]As far as documents being introduced with regard to general questionsdiscussed, they will be handed over during the defense of theindividual defendants. For the purpose of survey we will at theconclusion hand over the documents relative to a particular subjectcompiled in a special document book.The defense has distributed the subjects which have arisen as a resultof my survey among the individual counsel for the defense.

We have it, thank you.       C. Opening Statement for the Defendant Schlegelberger[73]DR. KUBUSCHOK: If, in my statement concerning the defense ingeneral,[74] I have just pointed out that the administration of justicein the National Socialist State cannot be judged separately but mustbe judged in the light of the whole administration of the Reich andits head, the dictatorship, I shall have to refer thus in defendingthe defendant Schlegelberger again and again to his personality, quiteapart from dealing with the objective facts as propounded by theprosecution in order to judge and interpret actions in their properlight.Franz Schlegelberger was, after many years of service to both theadministration of justice and the jurisprudence, already UnderSecretary when Hitler came to power. He kept this position until August1942 when Hitler, according to his pronouncements wanted to build upa National Socialist administration of justice. Schlegelberger hadalways been dealing with civil law. We will outline this, his activity,in general. When in January 1941 after the death of the Minister ofJustice Guertner, he took over the administration of the Ministry ofJustice as the then oldest Under Secretary according to rank, so tospeak; only then did he, in this position, and to the extent of thatposition, have to deal with criminal cases.If the prosecution on account of this, his position, has indictedhim on these individual counts and included him in the common legalframework of conspiracy, the defense will first of all show thatControl Council Law No. 10 does not provide a legal basis for anindictment of conspiracy to war crimes and crimes against humanity.My colleague, Dr. Haensel, responsible for the entire defense, hastaken over this subject and will make the necessary statements andput forward motions. In addition, I, myself, will submit sufficientevidence to prove that with a person of Schlegelbergers caliber,conspiracy and violent thinking are incompatible. I shall submitproof, as to his basic attitude during the whole of his tenure ofoffice, that he could never have either favored or promoted principlesof violent thinking, that on the contrary, all his activities wereaimed at preventing or at least modifying the course set by Hitlersdictatorship. We shall see, how he wrestled with the opposing forcesof the Party, and how unequally distributed the powers were, and howhis defensive attitude was breached but forcibly. We shall learn howmuch Hitler had always disliked the administration of justice and itsexpert administrators, and that, at a time, when not only the whole ofthe administration in Germany but also the entire public life, evento a certain extent private life, had already been coordinated andshaped according to National Socialist ideas. On 20 August 1942, hehad to realize the fact that he had to build up a National Socialistadministration of justice. Does this not constitute the truestjudgment of Schlegelberger that he be judged by a man, who after all,was best qualified to judge? Is it not evident that the administrationof justice under Guertner and Schlegelberger had done their utmost toface the avalanche? Is Hitler not best qualified to testify against thecharges brought by the prosecution, namely that Schlegelberger had lenthimself to the carrying out of National Socialist ideas of violence aspersonified by Hitler?With this point of view in mind we shall have to judge the defendantSchlegelberger: A man, known to us only by his work, performed withintegrity, and whose activities, viewed from National Socialistaspects, Hitler criticized in the above-mentioned way both in hisReichstag speech on 26 April 1942 and in his decree of 20 August 1942.Such a person has a right to point out: The charges brought by theprosecution which superficially regarded, appear to be against me, andthe charges that the prosecution has brought against me in order toincriminate me for my 10 years of service as Under Secretary cannot bejudged as isolated facts and without considering motives but must beevaluated as a whole. Thus, we will best be able to gain breathingspace after the speech of the prosecution, which is necessary in orderto reach impartial judgment and which culminates in the conclusion thatSchlegelberger had indeed played a prominent part in the destructionof German law, a reproach which he rightly rejects: with whichalso the statement of the British Broadcasting Corporation on theoccasion of his retirement from office in August 1942, namely, thatwith Schlegelberger, the last judge in Germany, had disappeared--isincompatible.Schlegelberger, under secretary for civil law, certainly knew how tosupervise the orphaned Ministry of Justice for a year and a half inan administrative capacity. The one who succeeded him, his appearancealready threateningly forecast, and to the stemming of whose courseSchlegelberger devoted his whole self, escaped judgment. The aspectof being the representative [Gesichtspunkt der Repraesentanz] whichobviously has influenced the prosecution essentially, has to bedisregarded.We will also have to take the fact into account, that Schlegelbergersposition as interim administrator of the Reich Ministry of Justice,did by no means equal that of a minister. If, in spite of these hectictimes when everything was being infected by the National Socialistvirus, he succeeded in retaining the position taken over from Guertner,his decision alone to remain in office until the limits of what couldnormally be expected of anyone, certainly not an easy decision, wouldfully justify this step. Judging by his personality and studying indetail the real and true situation during those years we shall explainwhat really was behind the Rostock speech mentioned by the prosecution.Evidence will be offered as to Schlegelbergers real relations withthe Party and how this was evident in the policy he pursued concerningquestions of personnel.His attitude toward Hitler will be subject to a careful examination. Weshall be unable to do justice to this task if we do not also acquaintourselves with those who blindly followed Hitler, and rendered thetask of Schlegelberger and prior to that, Guertners, so difficult.Freisler, his antipode, whom Hitler by entrusting him with all mattersconcerning criminal law had made into a guardian of National Socialistideas within the Ministry of Justice and all the other party officialswho hated the last bulwark of constitutional thought.With reference to individual counts of the indictment I shallpoint out that as seditious undermining of the military power[Wehrkraftzersetzung], so-called passive defeatism only became apunishable offense in 1943, and it was precisely for this purpose thatthe competency of the Peoples Court was established as per decree of29 January 1943. The practice of seditious undermining of the militarypower, to which the indictment refers, therefore did not take placeuntil Schlegelbergers retirement. At the time of Schlegelbergerstenure of office these cases of defeatism were judged according to theInsidious Statement Law [Heimtueckegesetz] and were not punishable bydeath but by a maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment. The extensionof the German criminal jurisdiction to include crimes committedabroad as well was practiced before Schlegelberger took over theadministration.I shall deal in detail with the legal question of the extension ofGerman law to the occupied territories and I shall throw some lighton the origin and the application of the ordinance concerning crimesof Poles and Jews. I shall show by means of the documents alreadysubmitted by the prosecution what demands were made by the Partyconcerning the treatment of the Poles and Jews and how these requestswere opposed by law and in practice. Schlegelbergers general attitudetoward the Jewish question will be the subject of the discussion.Even if the prosecution connects the defendant Schlegelberger with theextradition to the police of so-called asocial persons as well as ofPoles and of Jews, the defense will prove that those orders were onlygiven according to an agreement made between Himmler and Thierack inSeptember 1942. Previous, special cases only concerned direct ordersby Hitler given to the police and which could not be prevented by theadministration of justice. We shall see that the police had startedduring the time of Guertner to remove prisoners from the prison bycommand of Hitler if Hitler considered the sentence passed during thecriminal proceedings, a too mild one. Only in order to prevent thisif possible or at least to restrict it did Guertner insist that he beinformed of this order at the same time as were the police. It was onlybecause of that request that the administration of justice dealt withthese matters at all. It will be proved that everything possible wasdone in order to prevent extraditions to the police.I shall also speak of the practice of granting pardons and find herealso a confirmation of Schlegelbergers general attitude.The indictment also deals with the so-called euthanasia. We shall seethat Schlegelberger opposed the carrying out of the euthanasia programsoon after taking over the administration. He obviously succeeded, forwe shall establish that the measures were stopped in August 1941 andwere only started again at the time of Thierack as can be seen from themeeting described by the witness Suchomel.Concerning sterilization, we shall offer abundant evidence to provethat the practice of the courts for protecting the hereditary healthof the German people was unobjectionable, that those courts hadexamined conscientiously whether evidence as to the facts required bythe law had been submitted and especially sterilization for politicalor racial reasons was never decreed. I shall produce a witness to showthat this procedure had been carried out in an unobjectionable way,even where Jews were concerned.Regarding the question of the Night and Fog cases, it will be explainedfor what reasons and with which results the Night and Fog cases weretaken over by the general courts. It also will be set forth whatregulations were in force up to the date of Schlegelbergers retiringfrom office. The extent and the consequences of restricting theproceedings necessitated by maintaining secrecy will be explained.By submitting documents I shall present evidence about the politicaldevelopment of the National Socialist State and the structure ofits administration. I shall present documents referring to legalprovisions and their explanations concerning the questions raised bythe prosecution. Finally, I shall submit several affidavits which dealwith certain questions and help to form a judgment of Schlegelbergersentire personality. I shall produce a witness for the political andadministrative conditions in the National Socialist State. Anotherwitness will, as already mentioned, give evidence on the practice ofthe courts for the protecting of hereditary health of the German peopleand on general questions regarding sterilization. Finally, I shall nameas witness the personal Referent of the defendant who for many yearsheld this position up to the time of Schlegelbergers retirement fromoffice, and who by virtue of his knowledge gained through professionaland personal experience will be able to give evidence on numerousquestions which have to be discussed.             D. Opening Statement for Defendant Klemm[75]DR. SCHILF: May it please the Tribunal. By way ofintroduction, I should like to call attention to the fact that theindictment also clearly implies with regard to my client HerbertKlemm that, permeated as he was with National Socialist convictions,his one endeavor was to realize, by judicial methods and throughoutthe judicial field, the aims of National Socialist despotism. Theindictment also, indeed, implies that he was acquainted himselffrom the start in detail with the great extent of these aims. Theprosecution has tried, in connection with each action and with eachevent that came to light anywhere in the files, to refer everythingwith which my client was concerned back to that fundamentalconception. Yet in my opinion the prosecution does not make anyeffort to embark upon proof that the defendants had come to a mutualagreement in their own minds, such as must constitute the prerequisitefor the conspiracy of justice, for the furtherance of the Hitlerregime as alleged by the indictment. Instead, the prosecution iscontent to trace in every statement and every action simply a sign ofmalicious intent and bad faith without stopping to consider how suchactions are to be estimated in the light of historical developmentand within the limits of the phenomenon as a whole and the practicalpossibilities. Just as the indictment desires to see in the legislativepower [Rechtsschoepfung] conferred upon the judge by the alterationof paragraph 2 of the German Criminal Code an example of the judicialintention to try cases unrestrictedly and arbitrarily, withoutattention to legal guaranties, so also my client Klemm is creditedwith completely false motives in detail. Just as it will be provedby the defense that such legislative power for the judge had alreadybeen planned, long before 1933, in draft proposals for reform, withthe object of creating the necessary synthesis between merely codifiedlaw and the actual development of law through the giving of legaljudgments, so also shall I show, in my defense of the defendant Klemm,in general, that he, too, was concerned, in his measures, with thepreservation of real justice. Reference will therefore inevitably bemade to the background of historical development behind the measureswith which he is charged, to the related points in the German legalsystem, and to the actual distribution of power existing during theHitler regime. In this connection a great deal will depend on the viewthat is taken of his position, his potential influence and the limitsof his authority.In particular, I shall divide the subject matter of my proof intosections.In the first place, it will be necessary to begin with the fact that,outwardly, the defendant Klemm has to bear a certain amount of odium:he had joined the NSDAP before it took over power, and he remainedin it until the capitulation; he was at first Oberstaatsanwalt andMinisterial Councilor in the Reich Ministry of Justice, he was chief ofliaison with the SA and reached high rank in that organization, he wasa group leader in the Party Chancellery, and he was finally to becomeUnder Secretary in the Reich Ministry of Justice, the last positionhe held, and a personal friend of and very close collaborator withThierack, the Minister. The indictment evidently intends, by givingthis outward impression, to exhibit Klemm as a man who consideredjustice to be a means, and treated it as a means, to exclusivelypolitical ends. I shall prove that this was not the case. In order todemonstrate the seeming contradiction between outward appearance andactual private character, I consider it my duty to give the Tribunal acomprehensive picture of the personality of my client as a jurist andas a man. It will become evident that he was and remained a simple andstraightforward person, even after he rose higher in his career, thathe was a man of sensitive disposition and refined feeling and alwaysendeavored to act objectively and above all justly. I shall thereforehave to ask my client to explain in the witness box the ideas he hadconceived as to the aims of the NSDAP, the hopes he had before him inthe legal and political field, and the way in which he believed itpossible that the political intentions of the leadership of the statecould be combined with the idea that law has to prevail. He will haveto explain to the Tribunal how many things he actually did not know inorder to enable us to gain an accurate picture of the situation at thattime and of the developments.So far as the separate phases of the activity of the defendant Klemmare concerned, it must be said--The indictment takes as the first phase his activity asOberstaatsanwalt and Ministerial Councilor in the Reich Ministry ofJustice. The two charges specially raised against him in this fieldare concerned with the so-called more severe interrogations throughorgans of the Gestapo and with the fact that he was the Ministryschief of liaison with the SA. I shall prove that it was not the duty ofthe defendant to suggest in certain cases more severe interrogations,in other words, maltreatment of prisoners by the Gestapo. It was,on the contrary, his duty to prosecute such cases through criminalproceedings, since also the Gestapo and its organs were prohibited fromill-treating prisoners. In this connection I shall be able to take theopportunity to describe the attitude of my client by reference to thedocuments which were submitted in the IMT trial. It was the defendantKlemm who as an official in the Ministry of Justice of Saxony suggestedthe strict prosecution which was made so much of both in indictment andin the judgment given in the IMT trial of those SA men who had renderedthemselves guilty of ill-treatment of prisoners in the concentrationcamp at Hohenstein in Saxony. There is no ground for the assumptionthat Klemms attitude changed at a later date, when he worked in theReich Ministry of Justice.The position of a chief of liaison between the Ministry and the SAleaders will be described by me through reference to the documents. Thejudiciary as a public authority, had the duty to inform the SA leadersof any prosecution or condemnation of a member of the SA. It was thepurpose of such information to give the SA leaders the possibilityof removing criminal elements from their ranks. This purpose wasknown to the Reich Ministry of Justice. The chief offices of bothorganizations had to exchange information and experience and wereobliged to ascertain in which special cases they had to be interested.It was necessary to appoint a special Referent for this purpose, merelyin order to simplify the handling of these matters. This post wasfilled by my client Klemm, since he was simultaneously both a member ofthe SA and of the Ministry of Justice. I hope, indeed, to prove withspecial effect that it was absolutely opposed to Klemms conception ofhis office as such a liaison chief to suppress criminal proceedingsagainst SA members or protect them against prosecution, but that on thecontrary he thought it necessary to support vigorously the interestsof justice against the SA leaders. An individual case will give me theopportunity to demonstrate how also in this field Klemm was guided bylegal consideration alone, and this individual case will be symptomaticof the attitude of my client.In order to be able to judge correctly the activity of my client in theParty Chancellery, I consider it my duty to describe first of all thesphere of work and problems with which the Chancellery itself had todeal. This seems to me all the more necessary, as evidently completelyfalse ideas of this organization are prevalent. I shall thereforehave to show that by reason of legal regulations the latter had totake part in all the legislative and administrative work done by theMinistry of Justice and that it was not simply an office that carriedout tasks concerned purely with Party politics. In the constitutionalstructure of the Third Reich, the Party Chancellery had to performpublic functions. I may already at this point draw the attention ofthe Tribunal to the fact that my client is not affected by count fourof the indictment, in spite of the fact that he was employed in theChancellery of the Party. It is indeed a significant indication thatthe prosecution has formed an incorrect view of the Party Chancellery,if an official could be employed there who did _not_ belong to thecorps of leaders of the Party.An explanation of the bureaucratic structure of the Party cannotbe avoided; its division into separate departments and groups willhave to be described. The defendant Klemm was at the head of onlya subordinate group in the Party Chancellery. Its number was IIIc.I would ask the Tribunal to be so good as to take due note of thisnumber IIIc in my speech for the defense, so far as the latter isconcerned with the Party Chancellery, and also when I come to explainthe documents relative to the Party Chancellery. My client wasemployed exclusively in this legal group. This outward sign alone isan important circumstance to be considered in arriving at a correctestimate of the work of my client. The special task of this Group IIIcwas to deal with all matters which affected law, codification, and theadministrative work of the Ministry of Justice. The officials in thislegal group remained, as did Klemm also, officials of the Ministryof Justice; they were merely delegated by that ministry. They alsotherefore represented in the Party Chancellery the idea of justice andthe concerns of _their own_ ministry. Whenever different questionswere raised in Group IIIc, for example, questions as to the legaldisposition of the affairs of foreign peoples, a different departmentor group of the Party Chancellery dealt officially with and decidedupon the matter. Owing to this restriction of the field of their workthe legal group could only raise objections against the treatment ofany matter in another department if formal questions were handled. Thelegal group had no right of appeal if a matter had been decided onprinciple by other groups. Thus, it will be shown that the decree aboutpenal law with regard to Poles was not dealt with or decided upon inKlemms legal group but in Group IIIa of the Party Chancellery, whichwas concerned with questions on ethnic origin [Volkstumsfragen]. Thedefendant Klemm, therefore, could not exercise any influence whatever,during the period of his employment in the Party Chancellery, on theprovisions of this law.Through further evidence it will be made clear that Klemms position inthe Party Chancellery, as a consequence of the latters special methodof working, could only have slight influence on decisive matters.Really important affairs concerned with politics or both politics andlaw, so far as they may interest the Tribunal and the prosecution, werenot handled by the legal group headed by Klemm.The officials of the Party Chancellery, so far as they were groupleaders, had no influence whatsoever on politics. On the contrary, thiswas done by the Partys own office. The latter had no state functionsas had the Party Chancellery. The NSDAP had offices for agriculturalpolicy, peoples welfare, peoples health, a national legal office,an organization of Germans living abroad, and many more. There thepolitical principles were planned, there the influence was exercisedthat found expression in the sentence: The Party gives orders to theState. All these offices of the NSDAP must be separated clearly fromthe Party Chancellery with its function of a public nature. These Partyoffices transmitted their plans through the competent Reichsleiterdirectly to Hitler as the Party leader and head of State.Also the position of Bormann must be explained. He also had a varietyof offices and functions as Reich leader, secretary of the Fuehrer,and leader of the Party Chancellery. At the time when Klemm was workingin the Party Chancellery, Bormann was regularly in the Fuehrersheadquarters and thus away from Munich. All important questions ofa general nature, also those affecting justice and its policies andorganizations went directly to Bormann in the Fuehrers headquarters.There Bormann himself ordered that most of the matters be handled atonce. In such cases Klemms legal group often received no informationat all of his decision, or at the most a copy subsequently. WhenBormann transferred a job to the legal group in Munich he included asa rule instructions for the handling of the matter. When things werehandled in this way by Bormann no objections could be raised. Moreover,the evidence I will produce will destroy the rumor that my client hadclose contact with Bormann. They disliked each other very much. Themain reason was that Klemm did not accede willingly enough to thewishes of Bormann. It occurred only very rarely that Klemm reported toBormann. To a much greater extent than other subdepartment heads of theParty Chancellery, Klemm also informed Bormann about his own point ofview.After I shall have tried to clarify the unclear and dark picture of theParty Chancellery, I shall discuss in detail the _working method_of my client and I will outline in what matters he participated andhow far he is, therefore, responsible and in what matters he did notparticipate.(_a_) A series of documents submitted by the prosecution carry thedictation symbol of Bormann; I shall show that all these documents canhave nothing to do with my client, Klemm. They were prepared solely byBormann and his staff at the Fuehrer headquarters. No copy was sent tothe Party Chancellery at Munich, so that the legal group never receivedany knowledge of them. This is the reason why it is so important todraw attention to the symbol of the legal group, namely, IIIc. Klemmneither prepared, nor had any knowledge of, any letters of the PartyChancellery which do not bear this file number. Just as an exampleI mention Thieracks letter to Bormann on the collaboration of thejudicial authorities in the extermination of Poles, Jews, and gypsies(_NG-199, 199A, Pros. Ex. 243_). As Top Secret Reich Matter thiswriting never reached section IIIc of the Party Chancellery.(_b_) I will show that the defendant cannot be held responsiblefor a possible crime in which the huge organization of the PartyChancellery may have been involved, but not the defendant, if he hadnever participated in the planning, and if he could never have receivedinformation about it. It is my opinion that this is also not possibleby using the concept of conspiracy or the broadly defined forms ofparticipation according to the Law No. 10 of Control Council. Such areasoning is not possible especially if I will prove how strongly Klemmadvocated--especially in the Party Chancellery--the idea that law hasto prevail in a state, and how he tried to prevent that Party organs beinfluenced in any unfavorable way. Every day the Group IIIc receivedcomplaints against the justice, the judges, and against the officesof the administration of justice which wanted to influence pendingproceedings or even to change sentences which had already been passed.Work in connection with such complaints made up the biggest part ofthe working time of this group. In all these cases the complaints wererejected by stating that the judge is independent. I shall submitevidence to show that the Party Chancellery, particularly Group IIIc,expressly forbade all political leaders (that is, the Fuehrer Corps ofthe NSDAP) to interfere in the jurisdiction. It will be demonstratedthat this circular decree was issued on Klemms initiative. I shalldisprove the assertion of the prosecution and shall show that myclient advocated emphatically the punishment of Party members whowere found guilty of an offense. Accordingly, Klemm did not use hisposition in the Party Chancellery to keep justice under pressure buton the contrary tried to promote the interests of justice and the ideathat law has to prevail in a state. In the year 1941, for example,he succeeded in persuading Bormann in a memorandum to reject theplans of Himmler, who attempted already at that time to transfer thejurisdiction over the Poles to his police.(_c_) The documents submitted by the prosecution, so far as theyreally affect the legal group of the Party Chancellery, will not beable to invalidate my above assertions. When I will submit the evidencefor the defense I will have the opportunity to explain the purpose andthe context of these documents. It will be possible to correct manymisinterpretations.In this connection it seems to be necessary to explain briefly the factthat Klemms influence in the Party Chancellery was never so greatthat it could have played any part in the appointment of Thierack toMinister of Justice in the year 1942. Many a person who could not knowthe actual events and their background may have had some fantasticideas in this respect. The explanations of the defense will destroythese conceptions.(_d_) With regard to the activity of my client as Under Secretaryin the Reich Ministry of Justice, it will be the task of the legalpresentation to separate those actions and measures for which he isresponsible from those for which he is not responsible. Also withregard to this point I shall emphasize my point of view that onbasis of Law No. 10 of the Control Council, my client cannot be heldresponsible for what he himself did neither instigate nor approve.In order to be able to find the facts which will serve as the basisfor such legal arguments, I must give you during the proceedingsof evidence a detailed picture of my clients position as UnderSecretary, of his working field, and of the extent of his personalinfluence. Even externally the position of the Under Secretary hadchanged considerably since the appointment of Thierack. While beforethis time the Under Secretary in the Ministry of Justice stood onprinciple between a section chief and the minister, after that timehis function declined to the extent of being a figure [figurehead]beside the minister. Formerly the Under Secretary had a broad workingfield and had authority to make important decisions himself, and onlythe most important matters reached the minister himself, such asbills or critical matters with regard to policies of the State and ofjustice. Thierack himself on the other hand, handled all matters withregard to the administration of penal law which the section chief wasnot permitted or did not want to decide, and he degraded the undersecretary to a position in which the latter could merely give hisopinion like any other expert. It is correct, that from an externalpoint of view the working field of my client seemed to be greater thanthat of his predecessor, Dr. Rothenberger. The sections of MinistriesIII (legislation in the sphere of criminal law), IV (administrationof criminal law), and V (execution of sentences), which were notunder the latters jurisdiction were formally reassigned to Klemm.This seeming extension--my client was thus practically in charge ofthe whole Ministry of Justice with all its main sections but with theexception of section XV (section for secret matters) which was alreadyin the process of dissolution--actually resulted in a curtailmentof his executive powers. Only in a limited field did he receive theauthority to make independent decisions, namely as chief of sectionII, which was concerned mainly with educational problems and wherebyKlemm was entitled in personnel matters to propose appointment andpromotion of officials up to the grade of Landgerichtsdirektor andofficials of equivalent rank. In all other fields he was subjected tothe domineering orders of the minister in the same way as every otherofficial of the Ministry. Although he could call for the report of anexpert and could thus bring a matter to be decided within his sphere,he was prevented from doing so if the minister himself reserved thefinal word for himself. Through presentation of my evidence it will bemade clear how Thierack, because of his previous career, directed hisinterest, perhaps his only interest, to problems of criminal law andexecution of sentences.Thus, we will recognize that the above-mentioned main sections of theMinistry were only formally under the jurisdiction of Klemm and that nochange in the line of the direction of justice, as Thierack expressedit in a discussion of the section leaders on 7 January 1944 (_NG-195,Ex. 45_) resulted from the appointment of a new Under Secretary.It will be proved through the evidence how little the Under Secretarycould care for other sections, and that because of the externalcircumstances, as for instance the evacuation of whole sections fromBerlin, he was only rarely present at conferences with the minister orwas left out intentionally.(_e_) This limitation of the tasks of the under secretary throughthe organization was furthered through the personal qualities ofthe Minister, Thierack. A picture of Thierack will result from thedocuments and the statements of witnesses. He was an autocratic,brutal, and even a rude person. He pursued his views and objectiveswith remarkable stubbornness. Accordingly, he was hardly to bepersuaded from an opinion once formed. He tolerated no one next tohimself in his struggle for power. For such a person it must havebeen easy to suppress such a soft and yielding personality as Klemm.Thierack was not interested in problems of the jurisprudence inconcepts of law. He thought that he was a politician and merely apractitioner of the administration of justice. The contrast in thecharacters had an especially unfavorable effect on Klemms methodof working since Thierack thought he could treat Klemm merely as anofficial dependent on him personally. That resulted from the previouspersonal relations of the two men. When Thierack filled the post ofMinister of Justice for Saxony immediately after the seizure of powerby the NSDAP, Klemm was his adjutant. When Klemm after many yearsagain had to come into personal contact with Thierack through hisappointment to under secretary, he was in the opinion of Thierack, notmore than his adjutant again. When he contacted his Under SecretaryKlemm, his manners were just as rough as in his contact with othersubordinate officials. Even in the presence of other officials heshowed tactlessness, and treated him, too, with disdain and certainlynot as a friend and confidant, as the prosecution obviously assumes.Thierack would not attach such weight to an opinion voiced by Klemm aswould have been appropriate because of the latters official position.In my defense plea this personal relationship is of importance, sothat it must also be shown that Thierack was an extremely reservedperson. He disclosed his plans and intentions to nobody before theywere carried out. He kept the most important political-judicial eventsand decisions secret even from his under secretary. When he receivedthe visits of other Ministers, or higher Party and SS officials nobodyelse was present as a rule. This was particularly true in his contactswith Himmler and the people surrounding him, such as Kaltenbrunner. Ofthe contents of the discussions Klemm like the other officials of theMinistry was not informed until a decree of Thierack was published forthe individual sections of the Ministry.As to the outside Thierack used Klemm only if he considered itas advisable to emphasize his position as Under Secretary. Thus,Klemm signed legal decrees not really as deputy of the Minister whowas absent, but only when Thierack thought that he should put hissignature under a document of little significance. Klemm had to signthe correspondence with other ministries if Thierack preferred thisprocedure for reasons of prestige. This is the only reason for the factthat the so-called directing letters [Lenkungsbriefe] to the presidentsof the Appellate Courts Stuttgart and Hamburg do not bear Thieracksname but that of Klemm in spite of the fact that it was Thierack who,in individual reports, complained about the sentences as being toolight.(_f_) Starting from this general statement with regard to theevidence concerning Klemms position as Under Secretary, I will haveto discuss in detail the documents submitted by the prosecution andthe statements of the witnesses. Here it will be proved that the maincounts of the indictment have no relation at all to the activitiesof my client. Almost all the measures which the prosecution declaredas objectionable, were completed when Klemm took over the positionof Under Secretary. The special regulations against members offoreign nations were issued, the Jews were already excluded from thejurisdiction of the justice authorities, the so-called transfer ofasocial prisoners to the police--handled by department XV, whichwas never subordinated to Klemm, not even formally--was carriedout. My client practically had nothing to do anymore with the Nachtund Nebel cases. The interpretation of the laws by the courts wasdistinctly crystallized; a steady practice had already developed duringthe preceding 4 years of war, when the sentences became more severebecause of the conditions caused by the war. The prosecution did notsubmit any evidence showing that Klemm during his time in office asunder secretary advocated more severe sentences, especially in casesof high treason. The award of punishment and the granting of clemencytook place in accordance with distinctly developed standards. Inthis connection I will have to demonstrate in detail the proceedingswhich developed for the clemency questions in cases where a deathsentence had been imposed. It will be proved that Klemm did not adoptThieracks severity-on-principle [grundsaetzliche Haerte], but thaton the contrary, especially if the absence of the Minister offered anopportunity, he was inclined to be lenient. Impressive examples forthis fact will be given to the Court from the document book of theprosecution 3-L, Document NG-414, Prosecution Exhibit 252.In this connection the opportunity will arise to prove in generalthat it is only a mere assertion of the prosecution that the Ministryof Justice illegally ordered that a death sentence be carried out.Klemm did not participate in the issuance of directives concerningthe clearing of jails when the enemy approached. These were affairswhich were ordered by the executive department of the ministry (Dept.V). Evidence will be submitted which will prove that my client hadpractically nothing to do with Department V. They will prove that alldecisions in these questions were always made by Thierack, withoutconsulting his Under Secretary. Concerning the individual case aboutthe illegal murder in the penitentiary Sonnenburg, the evidenceobtained up to now through the cross-examinations of witnesses willbe supported by additional evidence. It will clearly be shown thatthe Ministry of Justice was not responsible for these measures. Itwill be seen that Klemm did not know anything about the common plan ofthe Reich defense commissioner and the general public prosecutor andthat therefore, he did not have the possibility to prevent that theirintentions were carried out.By reference to individual cases I will prove that, in accordance withthe plea made by the entire defense the judiciary did not do anythingwhich made the lynching of Allied fliers who were shot down possible.The contrary will be proved. It was Klemm who ordered that criminalproceedings should be started against Germans who had killed Alliedfliers illegally. The disputes with the Party offices with regard tothese orders will be shown. Furthermore, it will be proved that Klemmsaw to it that Germans, who treated bailed-out enemy fliers decentlywere protected from subordinated authorities of justice who showedover-great zeal.(_g_) When discussing the individual counts of the indictmentI will try to find the basis of the evidence for subsequent legalconsiderations. This includes especially the question, whether it canbe at all important for the judging of the facts of a crime, to examinethe actions of a superior Minister in which the subordinate UnderSecretary had also no part. Here the problem will not be the importanceof an order with regard to criminal law, but it will be discussed thatthe necessary causal connection is missing. Going further we will havethe opportunity to produce evidence before this Tribunal with regard tothe subjective side.I will demonstrate that Klemm, due to his conviction that law had toprevail in the state and due to his generally decent human attitudeinterceded on behalf of the law. It will be proved that my clientwas held in high regard by his co-workers in the Ministry, that hetried in many individual cases to mitigate the fundamental harshnessof Minister Thierack who was severe on principle, that he always wasready to listen to other officials, that he always was ready to acceptsensible suggestions; in general he was thus just the opposite ofThierack. This attitude also showed results, as will be proved, in thesphere of personnel policy. On principle he did not give any preferencefor positions to so-called old Party members. In case of promotionsand appointments he recommended persons who did not belong to theNSDAP. I shall be able to show cases where he also recommended personswho were on the other side [gegnerischen Lager], if they had specialprofessional qualifications. He tried to aid officials of justice who,for political reasons, were personally in difficulties.(_h_) Extended fields which Klemm handled in the Ministry ofJustice have not been mentioned by the prosecution. When submittingevidence I will have the opportunity to show especially that my clienthad to spend most of his working time in the Ministry for DepartmentII of the Ministry. This department handled all questions which wereconcerned with the general training of all German jurists. Here thespecial difficulties which arose with regard to the personnel ofthe authorities of justice on account of the events of the war hadto be surmounted. The evidence will show that my client in trainingthe young jurists omitted all politics, that his work was absolutelyunpolitical. Thus, the so-called ideological training and examinationswhich were very much favored in the time shortly after the assumptionof power of the NSDAP and which found a specially exact expression inthe Referendar Lager [camp for prospective lawyers] Hanns Kerrl wereexcluded from the professional education of the jurist. At the timewhen Klemm, at the beginning of the year 1944, took over his positionin the ministry, all these things had been settled a long time ago.The most urgent practical problems, where one should get young judges,when and in what manner young jurists should make their examinations,how former soldiers were to be treated, and similar questions belongedto Klemms working field. This was practical work, also this field hadnothing to do with politics. Thus, if the picture and the activity ofmy client will be made clear to the Tribunal, then it will be provedthat it is not a cheap attempt of throwing the blame upon dead persons,then it will become clear that it has been tried to make my client herein the dock the deputy of Thierack and perhaps also of Bormann. Klemmis, however, not responsible for their guilt.          E. Opening Statement for Defendant Rothenberger[76]DR. WANDSCHNEIDER: May I begin my opening statement? At thebeginning of my opening statement I want to say a few words about thetask of the defense as I see it.                     _I. The task of the defense_With the presentation of its theory of proof [Beweistheorie], thedefense really starts its task in this trial. It is confronted with anindictment presented in the name of the world community against thejustice officials in National Socialist Germany and referring to themoral conscience of just this world community. This situation requiresa few words about the duties and position of the German defense in thistrial. It is a cheap trick, if Germans now, subsequently, _merelybecause the National Socialistic State_ has collapsed, declare verysimply and without resistance that Hitler was not right, and ifthese same Germans during the National Socialist regime, completelyrenouncing their own attitude and personality, were opportunists andcooperated with the entire National Socialist Policy with just aslittle resistance. Such a confession on the part of the defense, whichwould be considered suitable only _because_ the sentence of theInternational Military Tribunal established the amoral character ofnational socialism, would also be a cheap trick and valueless. Opinionsare not formed on the basis of outward conditions, but on the basisof ones own knowledge. Of course, we do know on the basis of ourknowledge that under national socialism the basic rights and worth ofthe free individual and of the human community whose interests areinextricably bound together became corrupt and were destroyed andthat is, by misuse and waste of the most valuable sources of powerof the German nation itself and of other non-German nations. Onlyself-recognition, self-education, and efficient responsible cooperationof all members of a community lead to a really democratic way of lifeand state.The above statements which were made in order to be honest and aboveboard have not been made from the standpoint of any disinterestedneutral third party. How could a German defense counsel be inwardlyuntouched by the arguments of the prosecution, regardless of whetherand to what extent he, as a German, considers himself guilty. In viewof the fact that the German people were entangled into error, misery,and guilt, should he not feel even more that he is one of them, andshould he not try to gain that which cannot be lost--self-reflection,principles, and dignity. The defense wishes to thank the Tribunal forhaving given it full opportunity to represent the interests of itsclient in this spirit during this trial.   _II. Criminal facts of the case according to the indictment;   conspiracy and the individual facts of the case concerning war   crimes and crimes against humanity_Dr. Rothenberger is charged with the crime of conspiracy, committingwar crimes and crimes against humanity. According to the prosecution,the same concrete facts form the basis for the last two charges. Inlike manner, the charge of conspiracy is connected with the planning ofthe afore-mentioned war crimes and crimes against humanity. The factspresented by the prosecution to prove these crimes are in accordancewith the IMT judgment only relevant from the penal point of view sincethe beginning of the war. We are concerned with the following facts:_Numbers 9 and 21 of the indictment_--Use of the Special Courtsand the Peoples Courts for the oppression of political enemies._Numbers 10 and 22 of the indictment_--Participation in thediscussion between Himmler and Thierack of 18 September 1942._Numbers 11 and 23 of the indictment_--Sentencing and execution ofGermans and non-Germans for high treason._Numbers 14 and 26 of the indictment_--Illegal execution._Numbers 16 and 28 of the indictment_--Preferential treatmentshown Party members who are to be punished and collaboration in theintroduction of the special penal law for Jews and others.         _III. Nonexistence of a conspiracy on legal grounds_Before starting to discuss the basis for the above charges in theindictment, it seems fitting to treat briefly the question ofconspiracy. From a legal standpoint, attention must be called to thefact that according to the statute of the London Treaty, as well asthe Control Council Law No. 10, the conspiracy, or plan, can only beconsidered as a crime in itself if it concerns a crime against peacebut not if it concerns a war crime or crime against humanity. Thisviewpoint was maintained also by the IMT in trial No. I.    _IV. The general circumstances of the case which form the basis                  for the charges of the indictment_1. _Memorandum of Dr. Rothenberger_--In its opening statementagainst Dr. Rothenberger the prosecution called particular attention tohis memorandum to Hitler for the year 1942 and entered it as DocumentNG-075, Prosecution Exhibit 27. The prosecution characterized thisas a peculiar document and commented upon it from its own point ofview. The defense will also have to analyze the memorandum minutelyand discuss in detail its previous history and what has happened toit. It appears that the chief problem here is the basically importantquestion of the dominating position of the judge in the life of anation. The appointment of Dr. Rothenberger as Under Secretary can betraced back to this memorandum, the character of which is clearly opento a psychological judgment. Naturally the reasons for his appointmentwill have to be discussed in greater detail. The memorandum presentstherefore the very first of those important developments which put Dr.Rothenberger in the defendants dock in Nuernberg.2. _Dr. Rothenbergers reaction to the Hitler speech of 26 April1942_--The prosecution has further produced against Dr. Rothenbergerhis report on conditions to the Reich Ministry of Justice, dated 11 May1942, as Document NG-389, Prosecution Exhibit 76, which describes thereaction to Hitlers speech of notorious fame, dated 26 April 1942.The prosecution blames him for the measures taken after the Hitlerspeech, just as for the corresponding measures of autumn 1942. It willtherefore be the task of the defense to show how the measures taken byDr. Rothenberger in 1942 following the Hitler speech were meant, andwhat was their effect.The documents specified under this as well as the previous number, infact in the opinion of the defense, touch upon crucial questions ofthe whole trial; namely, the place of the judiciary in the NationalSocialist state. They require therefore a full description in thepresentation of evidence by this side.3. _Dr. Rothenbergers ideas on reform_--Dr. Rothenberger failedwith the plans for reform contained in his memorandum. It may alsobe conceded that they were bound to fail, by virtue of a historicalnecessity. However, that is not the point, but rather to demonstratethat Dr. Rothenberger exerted himself again and again to the utmostfor the preservation of the foundations of justice, in particular foran independent judiciary, and used all his strength to that end. Thedefense will clearly show that in the case of his discharge afterhe had served only 15 months as Under Secretary, not personal butdecisively factual differences were at stake, on account of which Dr.Rothenberger was no longer acceptable to the rulers in the Third Reich.4. _Dr. Rothenbergers personality and career from the prewar periodand into the Second World War_--The above events falling directlywithin the war period, become fully understandable only by showingthe development of Dr. Rothenbergers personal and professionalcircumstances before the war. It will be demonstrated that even before1933 he was a professionally able lawyer, interested solely in civillaw, energetic and conscious of his responsibility. It will furtherbe shown that after 1933 he succeeded in having his proposals for aconstitutional state adopted in Hamburg. He did become involved, inconstantly growing opposition to radical Party circles and to the SS,especially after the outbreak of the war.All the facts of the case expounded above under IV are legally relevantfrom the viewpoint of war crimes and crimes against humanity, as wellas from that of conspiracy; they are therefore presented with referenceto all charges against my client.   _V. The various facts of the case in the order of the indictment              and the position taken with regard to them_All the charges made against Dr. Rothenberger have to do with the fieldof criminal law and administration of punishment. It will be shown bythe prosecutions own documents and by further evidence, that Ministerof Justice Thierack reserved for himself all matters of criminal lawand criminal law procedure as well as of administration of punishment,and accordingly by the exclusion of Dr. Rothenberger, placedDepartments III, IV, V, and XV of the Ministry under his own direction.Dr. Rothenberger, therefore, neither had influence on the whole fieldof criminal law nor was he responsible for it. Neither Special Courtsnor the Peoples Court, neither general public prosecutors nor anysort of criminal courts nor prisons were under his direction. Thedescription of Dr. Rothenberger as successor of Freisler in the openingstatement on page 64 of the German translation is therefore incorrectand an error. Without question, the entire criminal law was under thedirection of the latter as Under Secretary, which from the beginningwas not the case with Dr. Rothenberger.1. _Concerning numbers 9 and 21 of the indictment_--Accordingto the above general statements, therefore, Dr. Rothenberger did notcooperate in the improper use of the Special Courts and the PeoplesCourts for the suppression of political opponents.2. _Concerning numbers 10 and 22 of the indictment_--On 18September 1942 an agreement was reached between Himmler and Thierackwhich according to a file note by Thierack, among other things,provides for the delivery of criminal prisoners to the SS for thepurpose of extermination by work and for the transfer to Himmler ofcriminal justice in cases concerning Jews, Poles, etc. It will be shownthat Dr. Rothenberger did not take part in the discussion of thesepoints, was not responsible for them, and had no knowledge of them atthat time.3. _Concerning numbers 11 and 23 of the indictment_--Dr.Rothenberger never took part in the sentencing of political opponentsfor high treason. If the prosecution takes the view that nonexerciseof the right of clemency after valid sentence applies, then in thecases in question with which Dr. Rothenberger dealt in the absence ofMinister Thierack, an opinion having regard to factual and legal pointswill be given.4. _Concerning numbers 14 and 26 of the indictment_--Insofar asthe four executions which took place erroneously on 8 September 1943 inPloetzensee, may be referred to by the charge of illegal executions,Dr. Rothenbergers lack of responsibility will be demonstrated by thedocuments of the prosecution and by further evidence.5. _Concerning numbers 16 and 28 of the indictment_--Dr.Rothenberger had no share in the preference given to Party membersin clemency proceedings, as is also established on the basis of thedocuments of the prosecution. Nor did he take a responsible part indepriving the Jews, and others, of their civil rights [Entrechtung], aswill be shown in detail.                 _VI. General aspects of criminality_To understand the line of reasoning on which this presentation ofevidence is based, attention is called to the following generalcriminalistic points of view which in themselves of course are known tothe Tribunal. If, nevertheless, they are emphasized here, it is becausethe Tribunal is confronted with the extraordinarily difficult task ofhaving to form a judgment of events, people, and mental processes froma world of thought which is alien to it.1. _Limited sphere of activity of individuals under a dictatorialregime_--Undoubtedly it is a characteristic of a dictatorial regimethat the great majority of the population sinks into more than averagepassivity and paralysis of responsibility, in contrast to a democracywhere the average citizens, too, the majority of the population,display a far greater initiative out of the practical experience oftheir liberty and their own sense of responsibility. However, it is acertainty that the few, who, under such a regime stand in oppositionto the rulers, thereby doing something which in a democracy wouldcarry no risk worth mentioning, thus risk their lives and liberty.Consequently, it is not possible to do justice to the circumstancesinvolved, if one minimizes the courageous actions of individuals ina dictatorial system by inept comparisons with conditions obtainingin a democracy. It is obvious, that the question to which degree anindividual had the power and opportunity in a police-state systemto call a halt to developments felt by him to be wrong, must in allfairness be judged by other standards.2. _Necessity of individual method of observation_--A dictatorshipblurs, especially to the foreign observer in a completely inconclusivemanner the actually existing, great individual and basic differences,on account of the coordination which to begin with was effected inthe exterior sphere. Thus, for example a German or Frenchman willhardly succeed in picking out one Chinese face out of a crowd ofChinese. One looks just like another. For that reason it is the moreimperative to take into consideration the individual personality andits historic as well as geographical background, like that whichbinds Dr. Rothenberger to the Hanseatic tradition of the old tradingand harbor city of Hamburg; the more inapplicable generalization andstandardization may lead to misjudging the specific importance of apersonality and the particular nature of his work.3. _Methodical ineptness of a retrospective view_--Evaluationfrom the point of view of criminal law is concerned with the possibleparticipation in the commission of a criminal act and the possiblepersonal guilt. It is decisive for judging a persons guilt toestablish whether he shared in and had knowledge of the crime andwhether he is conscious of it; so for instance in the case of theconspiracy which is alleged to have existed since 1933, knowledge ofthe criminal development of national socialism since that time isdecisive. In spite of some disappointments and bad experiences inindividual cases surely none of the defendants considered the NationalSocialist development in principle and as a whole as criminal, nor washe necessarily compelled to do so. It is not intended to question thestatements of the IMT about the destructive development of the NSDAP,which according to article X of Ordinance No. 7, are binding until thecontrary is conclusively proved. Nevertheless, it so happened that theNational Socialist era produced a number of events and institutionswhich were either politically indifferent or even appeared as theexpression of peaceful reconstruction; they were not mentioned in thefindings of the IMT. Public opinion, however, was formed on the basisof those manifestations. Questions such as the revival of trade,the construction of Autobahnen [super highways], the eliminationof unemployment, the creation of great social institutions, as forinstance the National Socialist Public Welfare Association (NSV) andthe Winter Relief Scheme (WHW), continuously, year in, year out, werein the limelight with the German public and overshadowed everythingelse, not to mention events in the field of foreign policy like theAnglo-German Naval Treaty, international sport events such as theOlympic games, etc. The greater part of the population, even theeducated classes, were not aware that unemployment was only eliminatedby an ever more formidable increase of the economic capacity for thepurpose of the coming war, and that the donations and subscriptionswhich the people collected by hard work for their social institutions,disappeared in the gorge of rearmament. Did not Hitlers protestationsthat the construction of Autobahnen was to be considered proof ofGermanys peaceful intentions of reconstruction, and not as theexpression of militaristic mentality, sound entirely convincing in viewof the fact that should it come to the point these same Autobahnenwould operate strategically to Germanys disadvantage which actuallydid happen?By his systematic and indubitably extremely cunning propaganda policy,Dr. Goebbels brought about step by step a constantly increasingisolation from foreign countries which made it more and more impossibleto form a truly objective judgment about other countries and questionsof foreign policy. It is true, treaties with foreign countries wereheralded with much publicity as proof of the desire for amicablecooperation with other nations. Considering these circumstances, weremen, even those in higher positions, as for instance, Dr. Rothenberger,who did not have the slightest insight into matters of foreign policy,to show less confidence in the National Socialist leadership of thestate than evidently was manifested by the foreign statesmen whoconcluded treaties with the Third Reich. Suspicious events were notdiscussed by the press and the public and thus escaped public attentionand judgment to a large extent. Insofar as dangerous practices ofnational socialism were still discernible in domestic and foreignpolicy, they never appeared as naked facts before the German publicas is stated by the IMT verdict but were exhaustively disguised incomments rendered harmless or even excused and justified as the resultsof alleged intrigues by the opposing camp.Without wishing to deny that there exists a certain predispositionon the part of the German people for the reception of authoritarianwisdom, bad though it may often be, one cannot get around the fact,that, based on the circumstances described above, the process bywhich Germans, even those on a higher level, arrived at an opinion andjudgment, of necessity moved and was bound to move along certain lines.The question as to knowledge of certain criminal acts and developments,or better yet, the question as to recognition of the criminality ofcertain acts and developments can therefore be judged psychologicallycorrectly only on the basis of all the conditions and contextsprevailing at that time. That applies particularly to wartime, whichin all countries produces special exigencies and places the strongestemphasis on certain desirable facts while suppressing undesirable ones.Retrospective observation which, in examining facts, does not putitself into conditions existing at that time, projects into the past,knowledge and opportunity of knowledge gained later. Applied to thistrial, the above-named method imputes to the defendants a knowledge, anawareness of the criminality of circumstances, which they did not haveat that time and makes demands on their faculties of perception whichthey could never have satisfied under the circumstances then prevailing.    _VII. Principles of the constitutional state: nulla poena sine                   lege, nullum crimen sine lege_The inner connection between the afore-mentioned train of thoughtsand the principles _nulla poena sine lege_ and _nullum crimensine lege_ is obvious. The question is whether facts constitutingcriminality were created after the war by the Charter of the LondonAgreement and the Control Council Law No. 10 which, in violation of theabove principles, are applied retroactively to previous acts, which atthe time of commission did not constitute criminal acts. The resultingcardinal problem will be discussed by the defense.                          _VIII. Conclusions_The great and famous American judge, Oliver Wendell Holmes, said in1896, The real reason for a decision are considerations of a politicalor social nature. It is erroneous to believe that a solution can befound solely with the aid of logic or general legal doctrines which noone contests. (Quoted from quotation in Majority Rule and MinorityRights of Henry Steele Commager, page 46 of the German translation.)The defense can but concur in these words. The defense requests thatconsideration be given to its train of thoughts as derived from thisattitude, and stated in VI, 3, which are the corollary of similarthoughts of the prosecution, without the Court having to fear amisunderstanding concerning the above quotation.             F. Opening Statement for Defendant Lautz[77]DR. GRUBE: May I begin my opening statement? The prosecutionin its arraignment of Lautz has obviously started from three wrongsuppositions. The first erroneous supposition was that Lautz evidentlywas confused with the Ministry official Letz and therefore it waserroneously assumed that Lautz had also been working in the ReichMinistry of Justice. Only thus can it be explained why in severalcounts of the indictment with which the prosecution is expresslycharging the Reich Ministry of Justice only, Lautz also is mentioned. Ido not want to lose myself in details. That the defendant Lautz neverworked in the Reich Ministry of Justice has been proved without a doubtby the evidence submitted so far. But I shall furnish further proofthat Lautz did not take part in any of the measures, with which theReich Ministry of Justice is charged.The second erroneous supposition from which the prosecution sets outis the assumption that there was only _one_ chief Reich publicprosecutor [Oberreichsanwalt], viz, defendant Lautz. The evidencetaken so far has shown that beside the chief Reich public prosecutorof the Peoples Court, viz, defendant Lautz, there was still anotherchief Reich public prosecutor, viz, the chief Reich public prosecutorof the Reich Supreme Court. It is due to this error on the part ofthe prosecuting authority that matters have been made the subject ofthis procedure with which defendant Lautz had nothing to do. It isthe nullity plea for instance of which I am thinking here; I shallprove in the course of my submission of evidence that this nullityplea could be filed only by the chief Reich public prosecutor of theReich Supreme Court and not by the chief Reich public prosecutor ofthe Peoples Court. It is due to the same erroneous supposition on thepart of the prosecution, according to which there was only _one_chief Reich public prosecutor, that in the information on the outlinesof the German judicial system, which was submitted by the prosecutionat the beginning of the trial, it is stated on page 5--The criminalprosecution in cases before the Peoples Court and before the Specialcourts, as well as those before the ordinary courts, lay in the handsof the chief Reich public prosecutor. Defendant Ernst Lautz was chiefReich public prosecutor. I shall prove in the course of the evidenceto be submitted by me that defendant Lautz was not a superior officialto the public prosecutors of the Special Courts and other courts andthat he was not competent for the criminal prosecution before thesecourts. I shall prove that he had only a quite limited competence,viz, competence for the criminal prosecution of those crimes forwhich the Peoples Court was competent, and that he was superior onlyin regard to the personnel of the Reich public prosecutors at thePeoples Court. The position of defendant Lautz as chief Reich publicprosecutor at the Peoples Court did not differ in any way from theposition of the chief public prosecutors [Oberstaatsanwaelte] at thedistrict courts. When these two points have been clarified, thereremains of all accusations made against defendant Lautz only the oneaccusation of his being coresponsible for the criminal procedurecarried through before the Peoples Court. This brings me to the thirderroneous supposition on which the indictment against Lautz is based.It is the fact that the prosecution in its indictment of Lautz, aswell as the other Reich public prosecutors under indictment here,obviously started from the assumption that the function and positionof a German public prosecutor are the same as that of the prosecutingauthority in Anglo-American criminal procedure. As will be proved bythe evidence of the defense the position of public prosecutor in theGerman criminal procedure as well as the position of the prosecutionin general in European jurisdiction always has been and still is todayfundamentally different from that of the prosecution in Anglo-Americanjurisdiction. The evidence will prove that the position of a Germanpublic prosecutor in relation to the law, the Ministry of Justice andthe court in general, as well as his function in individual criminaltrials always have been such that he cannot be made responsible incriminal law for the sentences and their execution, neither objectivelynor subjectively. The indictment in the case in question is based amongother things on the general principles of penal law, such as they arecontained in the penal laws of all civilized nations. As an exampleof this, the prosecution has quoted legal statements by the judgesStephen and Holmes in its verbal indictment. These legal statementsconcerning penal responsibility are not complete however. I shall proveby further quotations from legal statements by these two judges, thatalso according to Anglo-American conceptions the German prosecutor isnot responsible before criminal law for the sentences, provided onestarts from the position which the public prosecutor always held inrelation to the law, the Ministry of Justice and the court, and fromthe functions which he carried out in accordance with German law atall times in individual criminal trials. Although I am convinced byvirtue of this legal position that defendant Lautz cannot be maderesponsible before criminal law for the sentences pronounced by thePeoples Court, I shall, nevertheless, help to prove by my submissionof evidence that the Peoples Court was an unobjectionable institution;that any trial before it gave the defendants every guaranty of justice;and that the sentences of the Peoples Court and their execution didnot constitute any violation of international law, of the generalprinciples of penal law, or of article II of Control Council Law No.10. I furthermore shall prove that defendant Lautz had nothing to dowith penal administration. It will be proved that the institutes forpenal administration were not subordinated to him and that he had nopossibility of influencing them or penal administration in any way.           G. Opening Statement for Defendant von Ammon[78]DR. KUBUSCHOK: May it please the Tribunal. The prosecutionhas submitted no evidence connecting the defendant von Ammon withparagraphs 10, 16, 22, and 28 of the indictment. The defense willtherefore deal only with the count concerning the NN matters whiledisputing the legal admissibility of the accusation of conspiracy.The defense will explain the origin and the legal basis of the NNregulations. It will be shown that the legal authorities participatedin the work on the NN matters only to such an extent and so long asthey were delegated to do so by the competent Wehrmacht authorities.As regards the participation of the defendant von Ammon in thisdepartment which has been allocated to him in the course of theallocation of duties in the Ministry, the following will be dealtwith: von Ammons position as an expert, who was subordinated to thesubsection chief, Ministerialdirigent Mettgenberg; section chief atfirst Ministerialdirektor Crohne, later Ministerialdirektor Vollmer;Under Secretary, at first, Freisler and later Klemm; and lastlythe Minister himself. If, therefore, von Ammon only ranked fifthin seniority, then this fact determines also his authority to signand his actual responsibility. All important matters required thesignature of, at least, the subsection chief, in most cases that ofthe section chief. We therefore find that none of the letters from theReich Ministry to another office, which have been submitted by theprosecution, were signed by von Ammon.I shall prove that von Ammon did not participate in drawing up thebasic legal regulations. Thus, the legal argument arises whether aperson who has merely to carry out administrative tasks without therebycausing a wrong to be done in the sense of sufficient causality by thisactivity itself, bears a criminal responsibility for this.I shall describe how the NN proceedings were carried out and shall showthat no special regulations were issued restricting the proper trialbeyond the secrecy decreed by law. As can be seen from the circular of6 March 1943, Document NG-269, Prosecution Exhibit 319[79] submitted bythe prosecution, care was taken that the prisoners did not forego theirotherwise customary rights, as long as the purpose of this secrecywas not endangered. I shall disprove the view of the prosecution thatpersons who had obviously not committed any act of resistance, weretreated in the same way as guilty NN prisoners. I shall explain that,on principle, the Wehrmacht authorities in the occupied territorieshanded over only such cases to the legal authorities in Germany wherethe evidence was materially complete, as the witness Lehmann testifiedearlier. It will be proved that even where the innocence of theprisoner was established only in Germany, there was the possibility ofbeing released to the occupied territories.Evidence will be produced from the proceedings of the courts thatthe NN trials were in no way conducted differently from othertrials, except for the restrictions for reasons of secrecy. It willparticularly be shown that the difficulties in procuring evidencefrom the occupied territories favored the defendant insofar as he wasprotected by the principle of _in dubio pro reo_, i. e., thedefendant had to be acquitted in case of doubt where the evidence insupport of the indictment was incomplete. I shall endeavor to give asummary of the sentences given in actual practice.In regard to the handing over of NN prisoners to the police, noresponsibility can be attached to the defendant von Ammon forparticipation.Documents will prove that the defendant von Ammon always showed atendency towards leniency, considering the prevailing circumstances andthe extent of his competence. This will also be clearly in keeping withthe whole personality of the defendant. We shall find him an officialwho entered the ministerial career solely on the strength of his expertknowledge immediately after he passed his legal examination withspecial distinction, the type of man with a sense of duty who livesonly for his work. Von Ammon was not an active National Socialist, thisis confirmed by his entering the Party only in 1937, comparatively latefor a ministerial official. I shall produce testimonials characterizingthe defendant as a deeply humane and strictly religious man. I feelalso that the trial will enable the Tribunal to form their ownimpression in this respect. In these circumstances it will have to beexamined all the more carefully whether the evidence shows that thisman is guilty of a crime against humanity irreconcilable with hischaracter.            H. Opening Statement for Defendant Rothaug[80]DR. KOESSL: May it please the Tribunal. If I correctlyunderstand the unuttered yet cogent logic of the charges listed inthe indictment, the effect and example of that legal system to whichthe prosecution tries to attach the stigma of a criminal governmentinstitution begins with the Rothaug case. The evidence against him, outof proportion considering the entire framework of the indictment is incontrast to his mere functional position, based on his activities asjudge and prosecutor.Although I am aware of the fact that such purely external disproportionbetween the importance of the matter on the one hand and the deploymentof means on the other hand, as seen from a higher point of view, maycause a shifting of the focus in the eyes of a superficial observer,I am however certain that the desire for a true and just sentencewill prevent the overlooking of the limitations and degrees ofresponsibility.Yet the direction of the main thrust of the prosecution has becomerather clearly discernible by the few submitted documents, out ofthousands of files. We face it with a clear conscience, calm andcourageously, for documents do not lie.What distresses us is the evidence submitted in order to impress andotherwise help the main thrust, evidence which has been available inaccessible localities and without difficulties, with incriminatingtendencies, sometimes even willfully incriminating, and whichhas offered in hundreds of variations and superlatives an almostunfathomable jungle of assertions, estimates, and opinions.The mobilization of this evidence compels us to handle the mostenervating and tedious detail for truths sake.I expect to relieve us of much of this wearisome detail by firsttreating and solving problems, touched upon by coarsening efforts,misrepresentations, distortions, and half-truths in their entirety andfrom the broadest viewpoints possible.At this point in the proceedings, I do not wish to put to the forelegal questions within the framework of the defense, such as theconcept of conspiracy or the subjective fact and the confines of thecrimes against humanity.On the other hand, it will be unavoidable within the frame of theproducing of evidence to convince the court that the entirelyindividual biased power position between the state on the one hand andthe individual judge or prosecutor on the other hand in accordancewith the regulations governing German civil servants allows no scopein the field of the application of the law for a simultaneouslyexisting intellectual alliance in the sense of a conspiracy, but thata connection of this power position, in full knowledge of its legalnature, with a simultaneous assumption of a conspiracy would mean acontradiction in itself. Here it becomes necessary to prove that theactivity of a judge at the Special Court or a Reich public prosecutoris limited to the application of the law which is based on the officialReich legislation in the field of criminal law. I shall demonstratethat this Reich legislation in all its harshness has, in its purpose,neither lost nor limited its character of purely criminal law and that,on this point, it has not been misinterpreted as clearly proved by theliterature on the subject and the jurisdiction by the supreme judicialauthorities and others.Here must be proved a fact evident in itself, namely that judges andprosecutors in the same position as Rothaug were never and in nocontext expected to have objects alien to the field of criminal law incarrying out their official duties.Records of sentences already submitted and others still to be submittedwill prove that this had in no way been intended.This touches on the legal question, whether official functions restingon the official Reich legislation which, up to this very moment, iscovered in international law by the principle of nationality andsovereignty, functions which were carried out in public, may beconceived as actions of persecution on racial, religious, or politicalgrounds and may be treated as being on the same level as actions whichwere carried out secretly and without control, and which could berecognized as wrong already by their cruelty and severity by everyperson concerned as offending against justice and law.Here, I wish to convince the Court that offenses of the latter kind,if they ever did happen within the legal sphere could and should onlybe known to the immediate participants but not to persons who heldpositions like the defendant Rothaug.In the concrete reflection on the relationship to the law of theposition of judges and likewise prosecutors, it is of decisiveimportance to elucidate in public law that the German judge, underany regime, had merely to examine whether a law had been announced inaccordance with rules and regulations whereas an examination from otherpoints of view was outside his jurisdiction. In this context it isfurther necessary to elucidate the significance and import of the judgebeing subject to the law and the meaning of a sentence in the sense ofGerman public law especially in relationship to the legislative andexecutive power in an authoritarian state, thus to the governing power.Here we cannot omit to clarify the basic legal principles andcorresponding regulations which determine this relationship or toprove the practical application based on files. Thus, the questionof the judges subjection to the law calls for a clarification ofthe consequences on his task resulting thereof. It necessitates therecognition of the law as a form of expression of justice, as partof the legal system and as immediate emanation of the ruling statedoctrine at any given time, as well as the recognition of the judgesactual position in this legal system. Therefore, it is also necessaryto show in a condensed form the general basis and principle of thelegal doctrine which since 1933 was decisive for the German judge inestablishing the intentions of the law in a concrete individual case.The accusations which have been made in general or in individual casesconcerning Rothaugs method of handling proceedings or which havebeen connected with such proceedings become meaningless or lose inimportance if their explanation is tackled in general from the angle ofthe correct basic procedure regulations or from the available recordsof individual proceedings. This leads, as a matter of course, to abasic discussion of the individual cases which have been particularlystressed by the prosecution, and which lie in the direction of theprosecutions main thrust. No one knows better than the judge thehuman inadequacy and fallibility because by the very nature of hisprofession he deals with that aspect of life. Thus, he would be thelast to believe himself immune from human error, least of all at a timeof intellectual revolution and under the effect of the very highestwartime pressure. Nevertheless, I beg the Tribunal not to think mepresumptuous if I try to prove that the sentences pronounced by theSpecial Court at Nuernberg were in keeping with the basic principlesof jurisdiction of the Reich courts, and that among thousands of casesonly very rarely one has been successfully contested or otherwiseamended.In this connection, one could discuss the outward development ofthe judgment and all those legal questions allegedly discussed inindividual cases or in general in Rothaugs circle during the course of6 years.The submitted records of individual proceedings provide plenty ofopportunity to form an opinion on all individual questions thrown upby this trial especially on the aim of judicial activity, the sentencein its relationship to the requirements of the proceedings and itsassailability in the interest of legal security, from which it willclearly emerge that the sentence, even that of the Special Court, wasonly an intermediate and by no means the final stage of the work ofascertaining justice either when finding the defendant guilty or whenpronouncing the sentence. Thereby it may be possible too, to clear upthe linguistically unfortunate term of psychological producing ofevidence which has found its way into this trial. Thus, the legal andpsychological task of the presiding judge in accordance with Germancriminal law will have to be explained, and it will have to be shownhow Rothaug confronted his task, solved it in the practical legalprocedure, and which objections he had to face in connection with theresults of his work by departments which in the course of their ownduties had to examine, control and, if necessary, correct.Furthermore, it will be my task to prove that in Rothaugs officialworking sphere without exception all defendants without considerationof nationality, national origin, or race, were granted the same legalguaranties as any German according to German criminal law, thus thatno case was treated as an exception to the general rule, that thiswas also done in all proceedings against Poles, who apart from oneoutstanding case bearing a special character, were the only foreignersagainst whom Rothaug proceeded.This, generally and in particular, touches upon the problem whichdetermines the judges and the prosecutors position to the legislationfor Poles from an objective legal point of view, of which have to bediscussed the actual and legal basis and aspects from and through whichthe German judge and prosecutor whether in the North, South, East, orWest, had to view matters under the spell of the German legal doctrine.Here the greatest importance has to be attached to the kind of offensein question, the place of the crime and last, but not least, thequestion whether these Poles had really been deported and had notvoluntarily, accepting certain conditions, placed themselves at thedisposal of the German war power.In this context, we cannot omit to discuss the principles which thehighest judicial authorities have pronounced in connection with thiswhole complex. Here I must leave the justification of the legislationas such to others who are responsible for it.To this, from a psychological viewpoint, belongs the discussion ofRothaugs actual basic attitude toward the Jewish problem in order todo away with all insinuations which have willfully and on purpose beenmade during this trial by persons who seem to have cause to stress anddemonstrate their innocence in this connection by calling catch thethief.Another complex fitted into the direction of the main thrust of theprosecution is Rothaugs alleged political power position, inflated soas to appear almost like a myth, which to begin with is supported by anassertion which is the object of count four of the indictment. I shallprove that Rothaugs duties did not extend beyond the professionalorganization of the Rechtswahrerbund and that, beyond that, he heldno political post, and that in particular he did not belong anywhere,at any time, and in any function to the so-called corps of politicalleaders.In this I shall take special care to reduce the case Doebig which hasbeen brought into this context for the purpose of substantiation, tothe proportions it deserves in the knowledge of the true facts of thecase, as we ourselves feel urged to clear Rothaugs real relationshipto the Security Service (SD) as expressed in its principles,development, contents, and Rothaugs inner attitude to it down tominute details.Especially here as in all positions where the witnesses are interestedin a certain presentation of conditions, we are fully conscious of thedifficulties, and we know how easy it is today to find witnesses who byincriminating statements are given the chance to clear themselves. Onthe other hand, bearing in mind the totality of present psychologicalconditions it is difficult to find a person who would be prepared tostand up for truths sake if he were asked to do so for a person who byreason of biased evidence has been publicly defamed in such a mannerthat it has given rise to the fear of becoming involved in the greatestdifficulties by confessing to a mere acquaintance with Rothaug. BecauseRothaugs political power position has extensively been brought in,in an attempt transparent to our eyes, to reduce the responsibilityof others, he feels pressed to clarify his real relationship to hiscollaborators and the prosecutors within his sphere of work minutelyand in its totality in its official and personal aspect irrespectiveof whether it concerns Rothaugs official or unofficial statements,his alleged relationship to Streicher, Holz, and Zimmermann; hisactual relationship to Haberkern, the Blaue Traube [Blue Grape],the mysterious Stammtisch; his TeNo-Rang [rank in Teno[81]];his attitude toward the judicial administration, his recordingsection [Schallplattenbetrieb] in alleged spectacular proceedings;or his representation of the devil on earth. In all these matters andquestions we have but one aim--To restore the truth in all its glory,for only in truth can we see the way which honorably and serenely willlead us out of this endangered vital position.     IV. GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF GERMAN LAW DURING THE NAZI PERIOD                            A. IntroductionThroughout the trial and in the judgment of the Tribunal, referenceswere frequently made to various laws and decrees issued during HitlersThird Reich. Some of these laws and decrees were introduced by theprosecution, some by the defense, and some by both the prosecution andthe defense. Most of these laws and decrees are relevant in connectionwith more than one of the principal issues of the case. Hence, withrespect to laws and decrees selected for publication herein, it hasoften been difficult to decide where a particular law or decree shouldappear within the sections of this volume. To reduce the complexityof this matter, more than 30 laws and decrees have been reproducedtogether in the chronological order of their promulgation. (Section B,Selected Laws and Decrees, 19331944.) A number of other laws anddecrees appear in the later sections of the volume. In a further effortto reduce the difficulties inherent in this situation, cross-referencesby way of footnotes have often been made to laws or decrees mentionedin the documents and in the testimony.Since the main issues of the case involved the organization andadministration of justice in the Third Reich, it was also thoughtappropriate to include early in the volume some general materialson the organization of the Reich Ministry of Justice and the Germanjudicial system (sec. C). First appears a brief excerpt from thetestimony of the defendant Mettgenberg concerning the position andresponsibility of leading officials in the Reich Ministry of Justice(sec. C1). This is followed by parts of a Basic Information ofjustice (sec. C2). This Basic Information was submitted by theprosecution at the beginning of the trial not as evidence, but ratheras an aid to the understanding of the evidence later submitted. Theparts reproduced herein include a Summary of the organization ofthe administration of justice in Germany and two charts purportingto show graphically the structure of the regular and extraordinarycourts and the main positions held by the defendants in the over-alladministration of justice. The next following materials are allcontemporaneous documents, principally laws and decrees, concerningthe establishment and functioning of the Special Courts (sec. C3), thePeoples Court (sec. C4), the hereditary health courts (sec. C5), andcivilian courts martial (sec. C6).These materials on the general structure and organization of theadministration of justice are followed by extracts from the testimonyof the defense expert witness, Professor Jahrreiss, whose testimonydealt comprehensively with the development of German law andjustice from a period far antedating the Nazi regime (sec. D). Thissection concludes with extracts from the testimony of the defendantSchlegelberger, under secretary (Staatssekretaer) in the Reich Ministryof Justice (sec. E). In addition to giving a leading defense point ofview concerning general legal developments during the Hitler regime,this testimony introduces a number of the leading figures who played arole in the administration of justice and whose names frequently arisein the later appearing documents and testimony.

In order to enable the courts and thepublic prosecutors to continue the fulfilling of their tasks under theextraordinary conditions, I decree the following:                                   IThe procedure in penal cases including the administration ofpunishment, in civil cases and in matters of voluntary jurisdiction,is to be simplified and expedited, by eliminating all dispensablemeasures and by utilizing all available manpower, as far as it iscompatible with the purpose of the procedure. In particular, in penalcases the enforcement of the indictment by the offended party, and theformal decree of the court opening, the trial will be eliminated; theauthority of the local court in penal matters is to be enlarged, andthe admissibility of writs of punishment to be extended.                                  IIIndictments and judicial decisions will be written in concise style andcut down to the absolutely necessary.                                  IIIThe participation of professional associate judges in judicialdecisions is to be restricted.                                  IVAppeals against judicial decisions will be adapted to war conditions;they can be made subject to special admission. In civil cases of appealthe introduction of new factual material is to be further restricted.                                   V(1) The term of office of the members of the Special Senates of theReich Supreme Court and of the Peoples Court, as well as the honorarymembers of the Peoples Court, is extended to the termination of thewar.(2) The units and members of units of the Reich chamber of attorneys,the Reich chamber of notaries public and the notaries financeoffice will remain in office until the termination of the war; theirappointment can be revoked at any time.                                  VII commission the Reich Minister of Justice, in agreement with theReich Minister and chief of the Reich Chancellery, and the chief ofthe Party Chancellery, to issue the legal provisions necessary for theexecution of this decree.

In case of violation of these duties, the   Fuehrer is entitled, after conscientious examination, regardless   of so-called well established rights, to impose due punishment,   and to remove the offender from his post, rank and position,   without using prescribed procedures.

SCHILF (counsel for defendant Mettgenberg): Dr. Mettgenberg, at theReich Ministry of Justice you last held the position of a subdepartmentchief. In the course of this trial a great many things have been saidabout that subdepartment chief,[114] but you are the only defendant wholast held that position. Therefore, would you please give the court anoutline of that last position you held?DEFENDANT METTGENBERG: Perhaps I may somewhat exceed the scope of thequestion and say a few words about the structure of the Reich Ministryof Justice as a whole, of which so far nothing has been said here.The entire personnel of the Reich Ministry of Justice amounted toapproximately 800. Those 800 people composed three groups, the workers,the employees, and the officials. As an example for the workmen may Iperhaps mention the cleaning women and the boilermen. As an example forthe employees, the majority of the secretaries and typists. Officialswere those who held the posts of civil servants. Conditions to fulfillthe status of a civil servant were mainly of a formal nature. Withinthe body of civil servants there were three groups which must bedistinguished--the lower grade, the intermediate grade, and the highergrade. Lower officials were, for example, those who carried the files,the chief messengers, etc. Officials of the intermediate grade werethe men whose task it was to keep the registers and to draft documentswhich were made by the dozen. The higher grade of officials were thosebeginning with assessor [junior judge or prosecutor] up to the Ministerhimself. The scope of work for the higher grade civil servants wasdistributed in such a way that the younger of these civil servantswere employed as so-called co-workers [Mitarbeiter] or assistants.Above the co-workers there were the Referents.[115] They were olderofficials who held the rank of Oberregierungsrat or ministerialcounsellor [Ministerialrat].[115] Above them the next category wasthe subdepartment chiefs [Unterabteilungsleiter]. These subdepartmentchiefs were either senior ministerial counsellors [Ministerialraete] orMinisterialdirigenten.[115] Above them there were the department chiefs[Abteilungsleiter], as a rule a ministerial director.[115] Sometimes itwas a Ministerialdirigent. Above them, but only temporarily, there wasan assistant under secretary [Unterstaatssekretaer]. Above him therewas one or several under secretaries [Staatssekretaeren].[115] At thevery top there was the Reich Minister.[115] When one keeps that surveyin mind, the answer to the question which counsel put to me becomesfairly clear. The subdepartment chief was between the Referent and thedepartment chief. His task was to take reports from the Referent onmatters which were of a somewhat supernormal importance; matters whichwere altogether normal and clear and unambiguous, where there were nomisgivings, no doubts, there the Referent made the decision. But assoon as a matter, from any point of view, assumed somewhat greatersignificance, he had to report on it to the chief who, in turn, hadto consider as to whether he himself was competent to decide on thequestion. If it was of real significance, a report had to be made toa higher authority, to the department chief, to the State Secretary,and possibly to the Minister. In the absence of the department chief,the subdepartment chief had to deputize for him in his business asdepartment chief. And the organization with us was such that everysubdepartment chief for his sphere of work had to undertake that workas a deputy. In the big department IV, which has been discussed heresuch a great deal, there were in the end six subdepartment chiefs,each of whom had his own sphere of work. When the department chiefwas absent, each one of the six subdepartment chiefs had to deputizefor the department chief within and for his own sphere of work. Inthe main, my defense counsel has already explained the matter in hisopening statement, and I may therefore refer to it. As concerns myselfas a subdepartment chief, I too had to deputize for the departmentchief when matters were concerned which belonged within my sphere ofwork as a subdepartment chief.               2. EXTRACTS FROM THE BASIC INFORMATION               A BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE COURT SYSTEM[116]Following the practice of most continental nations, German law (basedprimarily on Roman law principles) is largely enacted into codes. Thecriminal code dates from 1871, and the code of criminal procedure from1877.Before Hitlers seizure of power, the individual German states(Laender) retained their sovereignty in the administration of justiceand the establishment of courts. There was, however, a Supreme Court ofthe entire German Reich (Reichsgericht), which sat at Leipzig.Under the Supreme Court, there were 34 district courts of appeal(Oberlandesgerichte), established in the several states and provinces.Under the district courts of appeal were some 180 district courts(Landgerichte) and about 2,200 local courts (Amtsgerichte).Both the Judicature Act of 1877 and the Weimar constitution (article102) provided that the courts and judges should be independent. Thegeneral administration of the courts, however, was controlled by theJustice Ministries--the Reich Supreme Court by the Reich Ministry ofJustice and the intermediate and lower courts by the Justice Ministriesof the individual states. The Reich and state prosecutors wereappointed and controlled by the respective Reich and state ministries.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *_The regular courts._ Original jurisdiction, both in civil andcriminal matters, was divided between the local courts and the districtcourts. The local courts served for civil cases where the claim didnot exceed 1500 reichsmarks, and criminal cases where the crime waspunishable with penal servitude up to 5 years. Cases where these limitswere exceeded were brought originally in the district courts.The appellate procedure was much simplified as a war measure in 1939.Criminal cases heard in the local courts could thereafter be appealedto the district courts, and criminal cases heard originally in thedistrict courts could be appealed directly to the Reich Supreme Court.Civil cases from the local courts could be taken on appeal directly tothe district courts of appeal; civil cases from the district courtscould be appealed to the district courts of appeal and thereafter tothe Reich Supreme Court.Under the impact of the war and the resulting shortage of judges andjudicial personnel, a decree in September 1944 further curtailed theright of appeal and entirely eliminated the judicial functions of thedistrict courts of appeal.The Reich Supreme Court was the court of first and last instance forcases of treason against the Reich but, as set forth below, in 1934this function was absorbed by the Peoples Court._Extraordinary courts._ Immediately after the seizure of power, by adecree of 21 March 1933,[117] Special Courts (Sondergerichte) wereestablished in order to combat the activities of opponents of the newregime. One Special Court was established within the area of eachdistrict court of appeal. Each court was composed of a president andtwo associates, drawn from the professional judges of the district. TheSpecial Courts were given jurisdiction over various crimes, includinginciting to disobedience of governmental orders, crimes in the natureof sabotage, and acts contrary to the public welfare. There was noappeal from decisions of the Special Courts.The following year, the Peoples Court (Volksgerichtshof) wasestablished by the law of 24 April 1934.[118] The Peoples Court triedcases of treason, which were withdrawn from the jurisdiction of theReich Supreme Court. During the following years, the jurisdiction ofthe Peoples Court was vastly increased by the expanded concept oftreason.The Peoples Court sat in six divisions, or senates; later on, aspecial senate was created to retry cases where, in the judgment ofthe Chief Public Prosecutor of the Reich, an insufficient punishmenthad been imposed. Ordinarily a senate of the Peoples Court wascomposed of five judges, of whom two were professional judges andthe other three were laymen specially appointed from the SS, thearmed forces, and the Nazi Party hierarchy. There was no appeal fromdecisions of the Peoples Court.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *Other special tribunals established under the third Reich included thehereditary health courts[119] (Erbgesundheitsgerichte) and in 1945,emergency civilian courts martial[120] (Standgerichte) in those partsof Germany which were near the front lines.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *          REGULAR AND EXTRAORDINARY COURTS OF THE THIRD REICH                                   +------+                                   |HITLER|                                   +------+                                       .                         +---------------------------+                         | REICH MINISTRY OF JUSTICE |............                         |        THE MINISTER       |           .                         +---------------------------+           .                         |    THE UNDER SECRETARY    |           .                         +---------------------------+           .                         |  DEPT.

Article 2The Special Courts have jurisdiction over crimes and offensesenumerated in the decree of the Reich President for the protectionof people and State of 28 February 1933 (Reichsgesetzblatt I, p. 83)and in the decree concerning the defense against insidious attacksagainst the government of the national revolution of 21 March 1933(Reichsgesetzblatt I, p. 135), provided that such crimes and offensesare not within the jurisdiction of the Reich Supreme Court or thecourts of appeal.                               Article 3(1) The Special Courts shall also be competent if a crime or offensewithin their jurisdiction constitutes at the same time anotherpunishable act.(2) If another punishable act is factually connected with a crime oroffense within the jurisdiction of the Special Courts, the proceedingsagainst the perpetrators and participants of the other punishable actmay be brought before the Special Court by way of combination.(3) The extension of jurisdiction according to paragraphs 1 and 2 doesnot apply to matters within the jurisdiction of the Reich Supreme Courtor the courts of appeal.                               Article 4(1) The Special Courts are composed of a president and two associatejudges. A deputy has to be appointed for each member in case of hisabsence.(2) The members and their deputies must be permanently appointed judgesof the district for which the Special Court is established.(3) The members will be appointed and the distribution of their tasksundertaken by the presidency of the district court in the district inwhich the Special Court is located.                               Article 5The prosecutors will be appointed by the legal administration of theStates from those prosecution officials who are legally qualified forthe office of a judge.                               Article 6The regulations of the code of criminal procedure and of the judicatureact will apply correspondingly to the proceedings, provided nothingelse has been determined.                               Article 7Proceedings may be instituted also before the Special Court in thedistrict in which the defendant was caught or where he is in custody.The release of the defendant does not affect this jurisdiction once ithas been established.                               Article 8Applications for disqualification of a judge will be decided upon bythe Special Court to which the respective judge is assigned. For thisdecision the respective judge is replaced by his deputy. The deputycannot be disqualified.                               Article 9(1) No hearings relating to the warrant of arrest will be held.(2) The decisions concerning arrest pending trial are made by thepresident of the Special Court. The president of the Special Court is,apart from the local court, also competent for those decisions, which,according to articles 125, 128 of the code of criminal procedure,fall under the jurisdiction of the local court. Complaints against thedecisions of the president and the local court will be decided upon bythe Special Court.(3) The president of the Special Court can delegate the interrogationof the defendant and the decision about the warrant of arrest to anassociate judge. The same applies to the decisions which are to be madeaccording to articles 116 and 148 of the code of criminal procedure.                              Article 10For the defendant who has not yet chosen counsel, counsel has to beappointed at the time when the date for the trial is fixed.                              Article 11A preliminary court investigation will not be held. If a preliminarycourt investigation is pending at the time this decree becomeseffective, the records are to be transferred in due time to theprosecutor of the Special Court.                              Article 12(1) The indictment must contain a summary of the results of theinvestigations.(2) The order of the court to open the trial can be dispensed with.Instead of the request of the prosecution for the order to open thetrial, there will be the request of the prosecution to fix a date forthe trial. After receiving the indictment the president will set adate for the trial, if in his opinion the legal prerequisites for itare fulfilled. Otherwise he will put the decision to the court. Whensetting the date for the trial, the president will also decide upon thewarrant of arrest or the continuation of the arrest pending trial.(3) The legal administration of the State can decree that the clerkof the Special Court will issue the summons for the trial and producethose objects which are to serve as evidence (art. 214, par. 1 of thecode of criminal procedure). The legal administration of the State candelegate this power.(4) The term of the summons (art. 217 of the code of criminalprocedure) is 3 days. It can be shortened to 24 hours.(5) The effects which the code of criminal procedure connects with theopening of the trial take place with the filing of the indictment. Theeffects, which the code of criminal procedure connects with the readingof the order of the court to open the trial, take place at the momentwhen the interrogation of the defendant as to the facts of the casebegins.                              Article 13The Special Court can refuse any offer of evidence, if the court hascome to the conviction that the evidence is not necessary for clearingup the case.                              Article 14The Special Court has to pass sentence even if the trial results inshowing the act, of which the defendant is accused, as not being underthe jurisdiction of the Special Court. This does not apply if the actconstitutes a crime or offense under the jurisdiction of the ReichSupreme Court or the courts of appeal; in this case the Special Courthas to proceed according to article 270, paragraphs 1 and 2 of the codeof criminal procedure.                              Article 15The results of the interrogations (art. 273, par. 2 of the code ofcriminal procedure) need not be incorporated in the record of the trial.                              Article 16(1) There is no legal appeal against decisions of the Special Courts.(2) Applications for a reopening of the case are to be decided upon bythe penal chamber of the district court. The reopening of the case infavor of the defendant will also take place if there are circumstanceswhich point to the necessity of reexamining the case in the ordinaryprocedure. The stipulation of article 363 of the code of criminalprocedure remains unaffected. If the application for the reopening ofthe case is justified, the trial will be ordered to take place beforethe competent ordinary court.                              Article 17Proceedings initiated on a punishable act within the jurisdictionof the Special Courts and pending at the date this decree becomeseffective, will be continued according to the general rules if thetrial has already started. Otherwise they will be transferred to theprocedure regulated in this decree.                              Article 18(1) When the activities of the Special Courts end, the pending caseswill be transferred to the ordinary procedure; the indictment filedaccording to the stipulations of this decree will become ineffective.(2) If the trial has once started before the Special Court, it will becarried on according to the stipulations of this decree.(3) The administration of punishment will be transferred to theauthority for the administration of punishment in whose district theSpecial Court had its seat; the court decisions occurring in the courseof the administration of punishment will be made by the penal chamberof the district court without hearings being held.Article 19This decree becomes effective on the second day after its promulgation.Berlin, 21 March 1933                                               The Reich Chancellor                                                         ADOLF HITLER                                  For the Reich Minister of Justice                                  The Vice Chancellor                                                            VON PAPEN    PARTIAL TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT NG-715    PROSECUTION EXHIBIT 112         DECREE OF 21 FEBRUARY 1940 CONCERNING JURISDICTION OF            CRIMINAL COURTS, SPECIAL COURTS, AND ADDITIONAL                   PROVISIONS OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE               1940 REICHSGESETZBLATT, PART I, PAGE 405       *       *       *       *       *       *       *                                PART II                            SPECIAL COURTS                               Section 1         _Organization and Jurisdiction of the Special Courts_                              Article 10                             Organization(1) A Special Court will be established with one or several districtcourts within the district of each court of appeal.(2) Location and district of the Special Courts are determined by theReich Minister of Justice.

Article 14    Establishment of jurisdiction of the court by the prosecution.(1) The Special Court also has jurisdiction over other crimes andoffenses, if the prosecution is of the opinion that immediatesentencing by the Special Court is indicated by the gravity orthe wickedness of the act, by the public excitement aroused or inconsideration of a serious threat to public order or security.                              Article 15                       Extension of Jurisdiction(1) The Special Court is also competent if a crime or offensebelonging to its jurisdiction at the same time constitutes anotherpunishable act.(2) If there is a factual connection between a crime or offensebelonging to the jurisdiction of the Special Court and anotherpunishable act, the latter can be brought before the Special Court byway of combination.                              Article 16                      Limitations of JurisdictionThe Special Court is not competent for offenses indicated in articles13 through 15, in as far as the competency of the Peoples Court or ofthe court of appeal is established.                               Section 2                  _Proceedings before Special Courts_                              Article 17               Application of General Rules of Procedure(1) For the proceedings before the Special Courts, the code of criminalprocedure, the judicature act, and their amendments apply, unlessotherwise specified.(2) The rules of the second chapter of the juvenile court law are notapplicable.                              Article 18                     Local Competency of the CourtThe Special Court shall also be competent for those defendants who areseized or kept in confinement in its district.

If,however, the trial shows that the act comes under the jurisdiction ofthe Peoples Court, the Special Court will refer the case to the lattercourt; article 270, paragraph 2, of the code of criminal procedureapplies accordingly.(2) If the trial of a case before the Peoples Court or the court ofappeal, after the filing of the indictment, shows that the SpecialCourt has exclusive jurisdiction over the act with which the defendantis charged, the Peoples Court or the court of appeal can either decidethe case themselves or direct the trial to take place before theSpecial Court. In the latter case the act with which the defendant ischarged has to be described, with emphasis on its legal characteristicsand on the penal law.

The overload of work on a Special Court should never result inthe handing over of cases to other courts.A Special Court is, as a rule, to be considered overloaded if a monthlyaverage of more than 40 new indictments has been filed with it.

Theirjurisdiction was initially limited to crimes and delicts as definedby the decree of the Reich President concerning the protection ofpeople and State[129] as well as in the Heimtueckegesetz.[130] Bythe decree on the extended jurisdiction of the Special Courts as ofDecember 1934 and through a series of subsequent laws the functions ofthe Special Courts were steadily increased. The decree of 20 November1938 then made it possible to bring before the Special Court suchcases in which immediate action by this court seemed necessary in viewof the gravity and the wickedness of the act or of the excitementaroused in public. After the outbreak of the war, by the decree of21 February 1940 concerning court jurisdiction there was establishedexclusive jurisdiction of the Special Court for a series of offenses,in particular for crimes and transgressions covered by the war economydecree. _Thus, the amount of work accruing to the Special Courtsincreased extraordinarily during the last years, especially during thewar. Practically all somewhat important criminal cases are now underthe jurisdiction of the Special Court._This increase in work caused the establishment of a great number ofnew Special Courts, the enlargement of existing Special Courts and theformation of new Special Court sections.                                   IThis development is commented upon as follows:1. Sentences by the Special Court in the first years after itsestablishment had a strongly intimidating effect. Prompt and severepunishment by the Special Court was dreaded. Moreover it was consideredparticularly shameful to have been sentenced by the Special Court.Since the focus of the entire system of criminal justice shifted inthe meantime from the ordinary courts (local courts, criminal sectionsof district courts) to the Special Courts, a certain watering down ofthe original conception of the Special Courts could not be entirelyavoided. Today the Special Courts basically are to be consideredmerely as special divisions of the criminal courts, their verdicts nolonger having that full intimidating effect they had before. The onlyessential difference from ordinary criminal jurisdiction is left in thefact that there is no legal appeal remedy against verdicts of SpecialCourts. The standing of Special Courts suffered from their having todeal with comparatively small offenses such as small scale illegalslaughtering, unauthorized fishing by a Pole, and the like.2. The concentration of jurisdiction in political and other mostimportant criminal cases led at first to an essentially homogenousand coherent jurisdiction. The establishment of new chambers in theSpecial Courts and the increase of these courts tends to endangerthis homogenousness. Since the verdicts of Special Courts were notregularly but rather casually published in the press, and sinceequalizing measures were taken only recently, the jurisdiction of theSpecial Courts, even of the individual chambers of one Special Court,developed partly in a very different manner. The first chamber of oneSpecial Court, for instance, is reported to have punished the theftof some items from a collection of textiles as the deed of a peoplesenemy with 4 years of penitentiary, while the second chamber of thesame Special Court in a very similar case imposed a sentence of only 8months.3. The strong increase of the number of Special Courts had broughtabout that, due to the scarcity of apt candidates, the selection ofjudges officiating in these courts could no longer be carried throughas carefully as it was done in the first years. While, in principle,only professionally and in particular politically highly qualifiedjudges were supposed to work in Special Courts, the increase ofpositions made it necessary to draft judges frequently from criminalcourts and civil sections who hardly were up to the required standards.Quite a number of judges in the Special Court are not even members ofthe Party.4. Due to the development of the Special Courts, the ordinary criminalcourts, especially the criminal court sections, have undergone anextreme decline in importance. While Special Courts are overburdenedwith work, some criminal court sections have hardly as much to do asthey had in peacetime. Furthermore, the latter now having only to dealwith trifling transgressions, they are gradually becoming less familiarwith severe cases. It is reported that the prosecution now shows atendency to bring many cases before the Special Courts which actuallydo not belong to their jurisdiction. On the one hand this is due to theprosecutors having greater confidence in the Special Courts, on theother to the fact that thus a delay of the execution of the sentencethrough appeal is made impossible.5. The permanent overburdening of the Special Courts had led in somedistricts to a gradual vanishing of their particular advantage, theirrapid sentencing. The Special Courts are said to proceed with suchdelay that at times the prison term imposed by the court is alreadyabsorbed by the custody preceding trial.                                  IIIt may be stressed that said development of the Special Courtjurisdiction is undesirable. In the interest of a rapid and severepunishment of the really outstanding crimes and transgressions itshould be attempted to maintain the character of the Special Courts asCourts Martial of the Home Front [Standgerichte der Inneren Front].1. In regard to organization, the following is pointed out:_a._ At some Special Courts several chambers were established.Experiences with several chambers are varying, but in general notfavorable. If the chambers are proceeding under different presidencyand with different personnel, several chambers are actually equal toseveral Special Courts. Consequently it is possible that the uniformityof jurisdiction disappears even within one Special Court. Not in allplaces and instances the ability to preserve a uniform jurisdictionwithin the Special Court through an exchange of ideas and experiencesand through an exchange of associate judges among the differentchambers is to be found._b._ Even greater is the danger of a not uniform jurisdictionif new Special Courts with competence in a limited district areestablished. It is yet considerably harder to bring about an exchangeof ideas and experiences and exchange of associate judges amongdifferent Special Courts than among several divisions of one andthe same Special Court. Therefore, no advantage can be seen in theestablishment of a whole series of new Special Courts as it has beennoticed during the last years._c._ Reinforcement of the existing Special Courts by assigninga number of additional associate judges is considered to be the mostsuitable method. The uniformity of the direction of the Special Courtis being secured by the presiding judge, while the most experiencedassociate judge should be made his deputy.This strengthening of the Special Courts will in any case secure theuniformity of jurisdiction and will make possible a more extensiveperformance than in separated Special Courts. This strengthening ofcourse is limited by the working capacity of the president and by hisability to exert influence. The president has to bear both in thepreparation and in the conduct of the trial, the bulk of physical andintellectual work, a circumstance which sets a natural limit to thisform of strengthening of the Special Courts.2. Furthermore it is stressed that the Special Courts return to theirproper task cannot be seen in organizational measures, but that asensible relief of the Special Courts from inappropriate criminal casesmust be accomplished._a._ A means thereto is already at hand now in article 24 of thedecree concerning court competence. According to it, Special Courts areentitled to transfer trivial cases to the local or the criminal courts.Apparently practice is not uniform in this respect. While some SpecialCourts, in view of their excessive pressure of work, have already madean extended use of the opportunity to transfer cases to the regularcourts, other Special Courts appear to have entirely renounced such atransfer, carrying through themselves even unimportant criminal cases.In general they base this on the bad experiences they made when theytransferred cases to the regular jurisdiction.In spite of that, transfers according to article 24 ought to bepractised to a far greater extent. Through the sentences as suggestedby the prosecutions, through judges letters and through directing ofthe criminal procedure, care has been taken that local and criminalcourts are being integrated into the framework of Special Courtjurisdiction. Thus, for instance, minor cases of illegal slaughtering,contact with prisoners of war, etc., could be transferred. If the penalcourts were continuously entrusted with these matters, then they wouldalso develop a uniform experience, which as yet is not possible. As afurther means of relief, according to the present state of legislation,a directive to the public prosecutors is suggested with the purposethat all minor cases should be prosecuted before the penal court andnot before the Special Court. Only political and really important casesarousing public excitement should be reserved for the Special Courts._b._ Hitherto the possibility of letting the president (one singlejudge) take decisions in the Special Court has not been sufficientlymade use of. In simple typical cases it is not necessary to call inassessors and to mobilize the whole apparatus of the Special Courts.Kindly let me have your opinion of these arguments before 1 August1943. Will you kindly especially express your opinion as regards theadvantages and the expediency of the three possibilities--criminalchamber system, central Special Court with several deputy presidents,and separate regional Special Courts, as well as about the question ofthe restriction of competence.[Seal of Ministry of Justice]                           DR.

FREISLER    TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT NG-157    PROSECUTION EXHIBIT 103LETTER FROM THE REICH MINISTER OF JUSTICE TO THE PRESIDENT OF THEPEOPLES COURT, 18 OCTOBER 1944, COMMENTING UPON ITS FUNCTIONS AND THESELECTION OF PRESIDING JUDGES IN PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT POLITICALCASES[Handwritten] MIi Berlin, 18 October 1944 [Handwritten]T 276_Copy_The Reich Minister of JusticeTo: The President of the Peoples Court, Dr. FreislerBerlin W 9Bellevuestrasse 15                                            [Handwritten] 18 October BzDear Mr. President:The importance of the Peoples Court for the maintenance of the homefront has greatly increased and is bound to increase still furtherafter carrying into effect of the Fuehrers decree of 20 September1944. The functions of the Peoples Court must, therefore, not beconfined to meting out adequate punishment to the accused, they mustmoreover fulfill the specific task of political leadership.This is inherent in the fact that the population not only recognizesthe sentences of the Peoples Court as right, but that, moreover, italso learns why any particular sentence has become expedient.The President of the senate is often hampered in conducting theproceedings, because in some particularly important politicalcases--including cases occurring frequently--the political evaluationof the offense is not always sufficiently shown up with a view tothe prevailing situation of the people and of the Reich. If it issufficient in nonpolitical criminal cases to show up the perpetrator,the deed and the effects of both on the national community and thus tofind a just sentence, this is not sufficient for cases tried in thePeoples Court. With due stress for the political aspect of the case itis necessary to discuss the conditions of the Reich and of the people.When conducting proceedings the president must be able to justify whythis particular offense is especially dangerous for the populationand the Reich and why it is especially grave. Everybody who is takingpart in the proceedings must have the inner conviction when leavingthe courtroom not only that the punishment was just but also why itwas just. This also and quite particularly applies to the so-calledcases of defeatism which from now on will be tried in an increasedmeasure. Likewise, utterances must not be allowed to spring up which,for instance, say that proceedings before a certain senate mean certaindeath, or that the term general public is stretched too far in itslegal definition. Whenever such utterances occur they can only beparried by a manner of conducting the proceedings which is superior,calm and--if need be--stone cold. In that case the people must alwaysunderstand why in these crucial months of the war the instigatordeserves death--but not so the gossip monger unless it happened not tobe merely silly gossip but a gossip which became dangerous because itwas unscrupulous.The above applies in corresponding measure to all other cases triedbefore the Peoples Court.I, therefore, would like to ask you, Mr. President, to make a specialendeavor especially that only such judges will preside in particularlyimportant political cases, who master the material involved also alongpolitical lines and who warrant that they are able not only to passjust sentences but also by their manner of conducting the proceedingsto convince those present of the correctness of the sentence. If anydifficulties as to personnel should occur here, please let me have youroral report.                                         Heil Hitler!                                                            Yours                                                         DR. THIERACK                   5.

Whoever tries to withdraw from his duties towards the commoncause, especially if it is done through cowardice or for personalprofit, must at once be called to account with the necessary severity,so that the State will not suffer damage through the failing of onesingle person. Therefore, the following has been decreed upon the orderof the Fuehrer in agreement with the Reich Minister and chief of theReich Chancellery, the Reich Minister of the Interior and the chief ofthe Party Chancellery:                                   ICourts martial are to be established in Reich defense districts whichare menaced by the approach of the enemy.                                  II1. The court martial consists of a judge of a criminal court aspresident and a member of the Leadership Corps [of the Nazi Party], ora leader of a unit affiliated with the National Socialist Party, and ofan officer of the armed forces, the Waffen SS [armed SS] or the police,as associate judges.2. The Reich defense commissioner appoints the members of the tribunaland designates a state attorney as public prosecutor.                                  III1. The courts martial have jurisdiction for all kinds of crimesendangering the German fighting power or undermining the peoplesfighting strength and will to fight.2. For these proceedings, the regulations of the code of criminalprocedure will be applied.                                  IV1. The sentence of the court martial will be either death, acquittal,or commitment to the regular court. The consent of the Reich defensecommissioner is required. He gives orders for the time, place, and kindof execution.2. If the Reich defense commissioner is not available, but theimmediate execution is indispensable, the public prosecutor isauthorized to act in his place.                                   VThe necessary regulations for amendment, changes and execution ofthis decree are issued by the Reich Minister of Justice in agreementwith the Reich Minister of the Interior and the chief of the PartyChancellery.

SCHILF (counsel for defendants Klemm and Mettgenberg):Professor Jahrreiss, may I ask you to tell us your name, yourprofession, and your residence.WITNESS JAHRREISS: Professor at Cologne University; at presenton the staff of editors of the record of IMT. Do you also wish me toname my residence, Counsel?Q. Yes.A. At this time, in Nuernberg. I was born at Dresden; the date of birthis 19 August 1894.Q. So that I can afford the Court the opportunity to acquaint itselfwith your particular research field, may I ask you briefly to describeto us your field of research as professor of law.A. My work since 1923 has dealt with the fields of constitutionallaw, international law, and the law by the League of Nations, generalconstitutional law, and philosophy of law.Q. May I ask you, just by way of example, to mention your ownpublications--those of a scientific nature.A. Well, that is rather a lot; but publications which concern thissubject here, I could mention--_Law and Calculability_, on thefoundations of law and state; another publication on _The Relation ofthe Constitution of the Reich to the League of Nations_; then in thetextbook which Anschuetz and Thoma edited on German Constitutional Law,my work about _The Equality of the Citizens before the Law_; andabove all, my own version of _The German Constitutional System_,of the year 1930.Q. Concerning the first problem, the German constitutional law, thatis the subject on which I wish to start. My first question will openthe direct examination. Is it correct that Hitler in the order of theso-called Third Reich was the supreme law giver?A. Yes, that is correct, although that was not so from the verybeginning of that era. That only happened in the course of events. Butat the latest, if youd like me to mention a date, that occurred whenthe offices of Chancellor and Reich President were united in him; thatis to say, 1 August 1934.[141] That is the latest date.Q. It was like this then--Hitlers authority developed gradually untilit reached its final culmination?A. Yes, that is correct. If I may add this, one must say that thedevelopment under Hitler followed a development which occurred prior tohis own era.Q. Do you mean to say by that, that 30 January 1933 did not bring abouta complete break of the development prior to Hitler?A. Yes, that is what I would say.Q. Do you also mean to say by this that the so-called change-over, thatis the seizure of power by the National Socialist Party, was legal?A. That is a very difficult question. First of all it is difficultbecause one would have to say in greater detail what events representedthe change-over, whether one adheres to the formation of the governmenton 30 January 1933, or whether one discusses the enabling act,promulgated on 24 March 1933,[142] or how far altogether one wants toextend the events of the change-over. I can only answer conditionally.If one considers only the formation of the government, that is to saythe act of entrusting Hitler with the Chancellorship on 30 January1933, and if by legal, one means the purely outward formality,then it cannot be denied that the operation was carried out legally,namely, under Article 53 of the Weimar constitution,[143] according towhich the Reich President forms the cabinet, and the Parliament--theReichstag--only afterwards has the opportunity to have a destructiveinfluence on the formation of the cabinet. Under the Weimarconstitution, the Reichstag does not form the cabinet alone or togetherwith another organ, but the President does that. The other organ isimmediately elected by the people of the Reich. That is why the Weimarconstitution contains quite rightly article 54[144] which incorporatesthe parliamentary system by establishing the institution of the voteof nonconfidence and entrusts the President with the formation of thecabinet. Yes, in fact one has to say a little more. In the formation ofthe government, the appointment of the Reich Chancellor is the sole actof the President; side by side with, let us say, the dismissal, withwhich the countersignature of the Chancellor is purely formal.In the development of the Weimar constitution, after initial wavering,there evolved the principle that the new Chancellor appointed orsigned the dismissal of the old Chancellor and his own appointment,which is really illogical. I dont think there is any need for meto explain that any further. But as the Weimar constitution inArticle 50[145] provided that every provision made by the presidentshould be countersigned by the Reich Chancellor, or one of the Reichministers--at least one--one was compelled to have even the appointmentof the new Chancellor countersigned. That means naturally for the newChancellor that he drags himself out of the mire by his own efforts.Counsel, if your question refers to 30 January--formally the procedurewas orderly; a great deal more difficult is the question concerningthe Reich law of 24 March 1933, that famous law [the Enabling Act],the validity of which was doubted so much; it is much more difficultto answer if your question refers to that. That law has as its maincontents--I can almost say with a little exaggeration--the eliminationof the division of powers. Three provisions or groups of provisions ofthe Weimar constitution are excepted, but for the rest the governmentcould now promulgate laws even if that meant changing the constitutionof the Reich; for the normal life of the people, legislators, andsupreme administrators are one and the same thing. That is a basicchange of the entire structure of the Weimar constitution. And I cansay frankly if I, during the first years of the Weimar constitution, asan expert on constitutional law, had been asked whether the Reichstag,even if there was a majority, could not change the constitution underarticle 76[146]--if the Reichstag would make such decisions, couldpass a law which, in effect, eliminates the Reichstag,--if I had beenasked such a question I would have said there is nothing about thatin article 76 that restricts the passing of such laws; but there isnot only legality, there is also legitimacy in every constitution;there are certain basic decisions contained in any constitution whichone cannot abandon without the entire losing of his character. But Imust say the German science of constitutional law, particularly inthe person of the most fanatic champions of democracy, did not takethat point of view. Gerhard Anschuetz, who if it is permitted to sayanything like that about a republic, was the crown jurist of the Weimarrepublic, wrote the commentary to the constitution of the GermanReich which is the authoritative commentary. Gerhard Anschuetz whoselast position was that of professor at Heidelberg, was, I might say,a temple guard of the Weimar constitution, and if he only thought anattempt had been made to shake the foundations of democracy, perhapsby creating a group of judges who could have reviewed decisions bythe Reichstag, he would have been furious. I must say that becauseonly now it becomes understandable what authority Anschuetz opinioncarried, which was concurred in by all German constitutional lawyers,that there were no limits for article 76, concerning the amendmentof the constitution. Anschuetz stated repeatedly that the Reichstag,with the majority that can amend the constitution, could abolish therepublic, the federal state, democracy, even basic laws. No judgewas entitled to doubt the constitutional validity of such a law. Ifpreviously I said that concerning that law of 24 March, one might havelegal misgivings, I had something different in mind. I believe if Ihad been the President of the Reich, and if I had had the knowledge ofthe events, I would have refused to issue that law and to promulgateit, for it is the Reich President who has to examine whether the lawhas come about in a constitutional manner. I am convinced, however,that on no account procedures can be constitutional when the majoritypresent, that is, the majority which passes the resolution, did notconstitute the majority of the Reichstag as elected [by the people]but constituted the majority of a Reichstag that had been curtailed bythe executive. Much has been said about that, and there is somethingelse that enters into that question, and I have to say that quiteopenly that has not been discussed before. At that session at whichthe Reichstag passed that law which changed the constitution, theReich Chancellor felt that the Reichstag might make difficulties, andhe threatened with revolutionary forces; but even that doesnt helpand, particularly, it doesnt help according to Anschuetz. Anschuetzand [other] German experts on constitutional law consistently upheldthe view that the assurance of the Reich President, given by hissignature, that the law had been passed in an orderly manner excludedall scrutiny. Therefore, we have to say, under objective law there maybe misgivings, serious misgivings about that procedure, but accordingto what at the time was the guaranteed practice of constitutional lawwhich was upheld by the opinion of the most fanatic upholders of theWeimar constitution, the signature by the Reich President excludedany scrutiny as to whether the law came about in an orderly manner. Ibelieve that I have now indicated that the question for the so-calledlegality of the change-over, even purely formal, is very difficult toanswer, but for the rest it seems to me that this is only an argumentabout words; [actually, it was] a revolution, and it was meant to be arevolution. Hitler even thought it was the only real revolution. Andaccording to its aim and meaning it [i.e., a revolution] cannot belegal; but in any case, if it comes off--that is how it always will bein the world of states--it provides the soil on which the new order,slowly or more quickly, evolves, according to custom, and custom afterall is the source of all law.Q. Professor, we are particularly interested to explain to the Tribunalthe constitutional status of the so-called Hitler decrees. May I askyou, now that you have answered the question of legality on the onehand and theories of legitimacy on the other hand, would you now, fromthe developments, explain the constitutional status of the Hitlerdecrees within the meaning of my first question as to whether he wassupreme legislator of the Reich.A. I am afraid I shall have to go back a bit for that because thatquestion really concerns the entire question of the so-calledconstitution of the Third Reich. Even for many a German, Hitlersauthority is a mystery, but it must be that for all those who arenot Germans. Many misunderstandings which I encounter again andagain in conversations are due to the fact that certain unavoidablefactors which are involved in any ruling, are ascribed to Hitlersregime. A further difficulty consists in the fact that the peculiarconstitutional insecurity in which most of the states in Europe havelived for many years, from the point of view of their constitution,produces phenomena which do not restrict themselves to Hitlers regime,but only appeared there particularly clearly. But above all--becauseotherwise I cannot provide you with the background--I should liketo explain that a little further to the Tribunal--above all, thereis considerable ignorance about certain peculiarities of the Germansituation, in particular concerning the constitution. I believe I maysay without encountering any contradiction that in this courtroomjurists are fighting for clarity among themselves which belongedto various schools of legal thought. Above all, there is betweenthe European continental states and their constitutional and legalthought on the one hand and the Anglo-Saxon legal thought, as far as Iunderstand it, a great difference which cannot be overestimated. Onthe continent of Europe, in the course of four centuries, a developmenthas taken place by which law and morality in legislative thought areseparated sharply; and so as the question of morality arises, thelawyer on the continent of Europe says as a lawyer, That has nothingto do with me. That may be regrettable, and I myself do think it isregrettable, but after all, that is the historical reality. Howfar that development goes, I can show to the Tribunal by giving anexample which perhaps is the most important, and again that concernsthe opinion of Gerhard Anschuetz concerning article 102 of theconstitution[147] as to whether the courts in Germany concerning thevalidity of the law passed by the Reichstag are entitled to doubt itfor ethical reasons. I quote--this is in the commentary of the 14thedition, page 476--If it cannot even be conceded that the judge isentitled to examine the law as for its being constitutional or not,so it can be conceded even less that he may refuse obedience to a lawwhich was passed constitutionally because according to his opinionconcerning certain standards which again according to his opinion areabove the legislator, that is to say, morality, ethics, natural law,they contradict these points or because they cannot stand up to certainevaluations.I had to read this out verbatim. Therefore, it was rather difficult forthe interpreter because of the position of the verbs.The reason for that situation in Germany, which is a situation thatapplies to the whole of Europe, is this--and I now have to broach asubject, the effect of which did not affect England or the UnitedStates. The state of the European continent came into existence fromthe fragments of the _Corpus Christianum_ of western Europe. Thebreak of the medieval realm is the soil on which the modern sovereignstates grew. These states starting with Italy believe ever morestrongly in the idea that they are sufficient to themselves, that theycan live by their own efforts, that they are under no obligation tothe past or to the future. The state becomes a purpose to itself. Thathas been emphasized again and again, and that development goes on fromMacchiavelli, the great Florentine; Jean Bodin, the great Frenchman;and as far as Hegel, the great German. As a result, ethical evaluationsmay be made by the legislator, parliament, or the monarch, but theresolution passed by the monarch or parliament deprives those who aregoverned by these laws of all right of objection.May I draw the attention of the Tribunal to one event that occurredunder the Weimar constitution. During the first years of the republicit became known among the public that Berlin was thinking of forbiddingany revalorization [or revaluation-- Aufwertung] by law.[148] Thejudges of the Reich Supreme Court of Leipzig at that time formed theirown association, and that association of judges, in view of that rumor,held a meeting and passed a resolution to the effect that if such a lawwere to be promulgated, they would refuse to apply it. That happenedin 1924, and it was emphasized that such a law would run counter tomorality. There was a storm of indignation among the Reich government.The Reich Minister of Justice protested using very sharp expressions,and the Reich Supreme Court did not carry out its threats. However,in 1927 the Reich Supreme Court in a decision published in volume 118declared--The legislator in the autocracy is not bound to any otherrestrictions but those which he draws for himself from the constitutionor from other laws.Now, I ask to be permitted to speak about a second point which concernsonly Germany, at least to that extent. It is easy to forget that theGerman people for 33 years have never had really normal conditions. Ifone looks at that from the human point of view, it means that about50 age-groups of German people--that is more than two-thirds--50age-groups of people have never seen normal conditions; that is, allthe people who were born after 1914, and those who, before 1914, didnot have any conscious experiences. For all these people, life--andthat was the normal thing for them--was a continuous change from opento latent crisis. One was always exposed to danger and always witha longing for stable conditions. The consequence is that for mostGermans, order, which deserves that name, is something hard to imagine.To the German people order has become to mean something transitory,something unstable, something upon which one cannot depend, anddoubtless it did not contribute to the stabilization of legal thoughtthat, beginning with the time of the Weimar republic the machineryof legislation was running incredibly fast. I would, indeed, desirefor the judges [of this Court] to see the maze of decrees and lawspublished and showered upon the German people since 1919. Most of thosewere laws or paragraphs of short existence. We had real inflation oflegislation, as far as I know, in history without example at any otherperiod. And that was not only so during the Weimar era, it becameworse indeed during the period of the Third Reich. Before Hitler came[to power] he turned with strong criticism against that positivemanufacturing of laws. In his opinion, only the sound sentiment of thepeople should find its inclination in laws. But when he was in power,the machinery, if this was possible, then was in even higher gear.I believe that I do not have to credit it to my own inefficiency but Ihave to believe that no German jurist can say anything else of himself,but, none of us were in a position to know all the headlines of allthe laws and decrees that have been passed. With things as they were,one has to understand that a large portion of the German nation, manyjurists among them, became tired and apathetic toward authority, andskeptical. And on the other hand it could not be avoided that manyimpulsive individuals revolted, wanted to take action, wanted to dosomething about it, wanted to come to a decision, to a clarification,to a simplification, to find a way to see through all that.In our era--at least one can say that for Europe--the political diseaseof fanaticism and doctrinism has broken out; tolerance became moreand more rare; each single technical question was tainted with thequestion of religious allegiance. Under these circumstances, one caneasily obtain a picture of the chaotic condition of legal thinking;small wonder that a state, to see to it that laws once decreed have tobe carried out by the authorities, demanded _particular_ emphasisbecause otherwise not even the minimum of order could be guaranteedwhich was at most possible. Particularly because the entire situation,the entire atmosphere was so unstable. The essence that an order is anorder had to become the last refuge of those actually in power.And now, a last part of it. Inflicted against this background of allthat we find in the constitution which, on paper, perhaps structurallyis the most sympathetic, the most logical democratic constitution ofthe world, with a tremendous, carefully thought-out system of checksand balances, safety valves in order to assure that the individualcitizen would be the one to have its full advantage. But thatconstitution was worked through elaborately, and I say openly, that mydetermination to study constitutional law was in part based on thatconstitution which enthused me as a young man; this constitution, atthe same time, was very complicated in its structure, its structuralpower and in legislative procedure.With the permission of the Tribunal I shall try to explain that lifeitself demanded to have these matters simplified--rather less artistrybut more efficacy. With that I believe, in all brevity, to have saidsomething of that which is absolutely necessary to know if one wants tounderstand the essence of the Weimar constitution and its developmentwhich, long before Hitler, had led to a situation which does not permitto recognize any longer the situation of 1919.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *In German we call a law which was brought about by the legislativeauthority, a law in the formal sense. And the basic thought for all,which is to be found in all European constitutions, is this. If thegovernment wants to, let us say, increase taxation, then that meansit wants some acts of legislation which authorize the authorities,or the various agencies, to interfere with property. The government,therefore, wants a law in the material sense; therefore it musthave a law in the procedural sense or in the formal sense, throughlegislation. That is what we call the principle of the necessity ofthe law, the fact that a law is required. Where this is brought about,we have a division of power. And if it were brought about--and ithas never actually been carried out--then this is the way it wouldhave to come about. The legislative body then would have to make allsubstantive laws, but it would do nothing but just that.Both these cases do not apply. Parliaments, time and again, are giventhe privilege or the right to come to resolutions or decisions whichhave different content, for example, decisions on budget. Thesedecisions on budget are not acts of legislation in the sense of settingstandards. In German constitutional law it is definitely prohibitedto include into the budgets acts of legislation or standards in thatsense. The Parliament has a part in the forming of the cabinet. That isone thing. The other--and this is what we need--is the following. Itmay happen that the government is authorized to enact legislation byvirtue of the constitution itself, or by virtue of later laws passed bythe parliament. In German one calls these acts of rule making [Akte derNormsetzung] of the government, that is of the executive--which have alegal maxim as content--legal decrees [Rechtsverordnungen]. Legal onaccount of their content, and decrees on account of the method.This institution, which we find in every European state, was thestarting-point for the further development and the paving of the way ofthe orders by Hitler, because in the Weimar constitution there is a lawfor the government to decree laws, the utilization, or I should say theexploitation of, which led to the fact that since the middle of 1930the normal legislative body in Germany was really the government. Thatis the famous provision of article 48, paragraph 2. As a rule, legaldecrees on the basis of this article are called dictatorial decrees,but also apart from that during the Weimar era, much authority wasreceived for the government to issue decrees. In countless laws theReichstag empowered the government, in order to carry out a law, orin some cases in order to amend a law or repeal a law, to issue legaldecrees.However, not only in the Reich do we find this institution or thisinstrument of legal decrees, but also in the German states, the GermanLaender. In the constitution one always finds a [provision concerningthe] right to issue emergency decrees (Notverordnungsrecht) and thelegislatures of the various states frequently authorize the [state]government to issue decrees in regard to substantive law.A law of the Reichstag of 13 October 1923, which is called EnablingLaw, Ermaechtigungsgesetz, signed by Reich President Ebert, conferredupon the Reich government the power, among other things, to issuedecrees in regard to substantive law, even deviating from the legalprinciples of the constitution of the Reich. This law is particularlyimportant. It was published in the first years of the Weimarconstitution under Reich President Ebert, and it cleared the way for adevelopment which the founders of this law to this day probably regretdeeply.May I refer the Tribunal to the following:Several months ago, in Munich, a book was published, The History ofthe Weimar Constitution. The author is Professor Willibalt Apelt, nowat the University of Munich. We used to be together at the Universityof Leipzig, and I also had the honor to lecture for him in addition tomy lectures when he became the Minister of Interior in Saxony; that is,the Police Minister.He was one of the most outspoken democrats we had in Germany. Thisbook throughout is a [settling of an] account [Abrechung] with Hitler.It altogether lauds the Weimar constitution, and therefore it isparticularly important to note that Apelt considers this law thebeginning of all the evil in this development and states explicitlythat this law cleared the way to that other enabling law of 24 March1933. * * * The date of the law is 13 October 1923. It appeared inthe Reichsgesetzblatt of 1923, volume I on page 943. Since the middleof 1930 one did no more work with enabling law decrees, but one usedarticle 48, paragraph 2. Earlier already that had been applied. If Iam informed correctly under Ebert alone, 136 decrees of that kind werepassed, that is to say, until 1925 when Hindenburg became President.At first a little less use was made of this means. It was reactivatedagain when the economic crisis of 1929 was nearing Europe. Conditionsin Germany deteriorated from week to week, and under Bruening wholebundles of emergency decrees, of dictatorial decrees, were passed. In1932 we had progressed so far in that direction that the Reichstag waspractically excluded as a legislative body, and the Reich President,together with the Reich government (the Reich cabinet because accordingto article 50 they had to work together) was really the normal sourceof legislation. From then on until Hitlers acts of legislation it isindeed only a short step, and if Hitler himself would not have set outto give the whole matter a triumphant dictatorial aspect, if he hadbeen satisfied with an enabling act like that of 1923, if he had nothad laws enacted by the government but decrees, the entire enabling actwould not have caused so much rumpus as it did.Q. Professor, may I ask you to explain briefly to the Tribunal whoReich President Ebert was, because we have to assume that the namealone does not give a plain indication. * * *A. We had two Reich Presidents. The first, Friedrich Ebert, who camefrom the social democratic party of Germany, not elected by the peoplebut by the national assembly, and then the second, von Hindenburg, whowas elected by the people.Q. And my second and other request is that you quote to the Tribunalarticle 48, paragraph 2 of the Weimar constitution.A. Article 48, paragraph 2. Concerning the so-called dictatorialpowers of the president--and with the permission of the Tribunal, Ishall formulate these sentences linguistically in a way which makethem easily translatable--The Reich President may take those measureswhich are necessary to reestablish public security and order if, in thearea of the German Reich, public security and order are considerablydisturbed or endangered. If required, he may also intervene with theaid of the armed forces. For that purpose he is authorized temporarilyto invalidate in whole or in part the basic laws which are laid downin the articles 114, 115, 117, 118, 123, 124, 153.[149] May I add,these seven basic laws are the so-called liberal principles, [basicliberties], the same which we find, for instance, in the Constitutionof the United States, the Bill of Rights.Q. Professor, we are now concerned with an attempt to explain theHitler decree to the Tribunal. After all we have heard from you now,the development which has led to it that the government governed bydecrees rather than by legislation, that development started alreadyas early as 1923, and according to the information we have from youwas again stipulated in 1930 at the time of a different government.I think it will be necessary to explain to the Tribunal that thisdevelopment led up to the Hitler decree; went through various stages ofdevelopment, and I may ask you still to describe this to us, because inthe course of this case it has become necessary that this developmentbe shown asclearly as possible.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *The cabinet assumed responsibility [for all orders and directivesissued by the Reich President] to the Reichstag by countersigningthem, and the Reichstag could react rather disagreeably; the cabinet,if the Reich President and the Reichstag were of different opinions,was forced to make a decision. If the cabinet took the opinion of theReichstag, then the Reich President either had to give in or changethe cabinet; if the cabinet went along with the President, thennothing else was left than to risk the vote of lack of confidence; anessential vote of the Reichstag could lead, therefore, to a struggleof that kind, and in German practice the cabinet which went with thepresident against the Reichstag was called a fighting government[Kampfregierung]; not the other way around. In the long run it showedthat the Reich President, when the Chancellor went with him, wasstronger than the Reichstag. That also I may be permitted to describebriefly. If the Reichstag did not agree with the president, was notsatisfied with the presidents decisions, it could not, properlyspeaking, do anything. Even though the constitution in article 43[150]reserved to the Reichstag the right to ask the people of the Reichthat they demand the resignation or the dismissal of the president.That, in practice, never occurred, and for a very simple reason. Ifthe Reichstag would have come to a decision of that kind, and thepeople would not have gone along, then that president would have beenautomatically reelected for another 7 years, and also, the Reichstagwould have been dissolved, and that would mean suicide [for theReichstag]. However, the president is in a much better position; ifhe is in agreement with the Chancellor, he can dissolve the Reichstaghimself. That is where the famous red folder comes in.[151] If,therefore, the president and the cabinet are in agreement, and there isa threat of censure on the part of the Reichstag, then the presidentcan turn over to the Reich Chancellor the order for dissolution [of theReichstag]. The Reich Chancellor is present in the session, and whenit comes to the last, he just shows that red folder and that settlesthe entire matter. Now, the Tribunal will certainly understand why indiscussing article 48, paragraph 2, I did not even read paragraph3,[152] because there it is expressed that the Reich President has tonotify the Reichstag of every dictatorial measure and if the Reichstagwants it withdrawn, and the demands are made of the president, thepresident has to repeal his measures. If he and the cabinet do not wishto do that, they have the possibility of dissolving the Reichstag, andthat brings me back to what I pointed out before. Maybe one cannotunderstand why the Reichstag permitted itself to be dispossessed, asfar as legislation is concerned. It would have had to be made entirelydifferent to be in a position to oppose due to the fact that the majorchange could not depend upon them. The Reichstag in every demand ofrepeal risked its own life.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *Perhaps at this moment I can jump ahead into the Hitler era. When theHitler government had received the right to pass laws it no longerneeded the Reichstag. If one wanted to use the Reichstag at all as alegislative body, one did so to save face. But, now the government didno longer make any suggestions as was, in former times, the normalprocedure. The government was the legislator itself. But that way waschosen; a way, which during the Weimar era played no part.Under Hitler the Reichstag since November 1933, consisted only ofone faction. That is just as senseless as one party. This factionintroduced a bill with the name of Adolf Hitler and three others.Frick, the faction chairman accomplished this, Goering acted surprised,being the president, and then, the whole game went on as you know it.That abnormal way, therefore, was chosen in order to stage the play.Now I go back to the Weimar era. As to whether the bill was introducedthis way or that way, for the Reichstag, that was only raw material.It could say, We will not do anything. It could say, We will passit. It could say, We will change it. If a bill is passed, it meansthat the bill is accepted or amended; then the Reich President receivedthe law which was had been passed by the Reichstag for his signature.Signing a law, that meant as to whether the law was passed in theproper way, and as to whether the text which had been submitted tothe president was actually the text which was passed under the law bythe Reichstag. (It did, in effect, happen that other documents weresubmitted to him than those passed by the Reichstag, of course, bymistake. Next, the Reichsgesetzblatt had to publish it with a specialwrapper in the changed form.) And when that happened, then, thepresident gave the order for promulgation. In Germany we usually callit promulgation, too. So far so good.So much so good. But, now, it could happen that the Reich councilor the Reich President with the consent of the government or thegovernment with the consent of the president or some of the membersof the Reichstag, itself, were dissatisfied with the law, and, inthat case, the constitution provided that those unsatisfied personsor bodies could appeal to the people. That is very complicated, YourHonors, and I do not think that we need it for our purpose here. Youwill find it written down but I dont think I need to elaborate on ithere.If such an appeal would have been made to the nation--it neverhappened, it got stuck in the beginning--then that had to be fought outat the time between signature and promulgation. But the constitutionhad provided for a special procedure, an act of absolute democracybecame possible--the people of the Reich, that is to say, at leastone-tenth of the whole electorate,--at that time, that was at leastfour million voters--could join together and demand that a bill whichhad to be drafted up to the very last [detail], was to be submittedby the Reichstag, and, in that case, the Reichstag was not as freetoward the draft as in the other case. But it was under pressure of anultimatum. It was only left with the choice either to accept it as itwas or the government had to ask the nation. That was attempted a fewtimes but it was never carried out properly.I should assume that those remarks were sufficient to show to theTribunal that on the one hand the Weimar constitution was verydemocratic, with the intent to protect the people and its rights; butthat on the other hand the constitution was so complicated in thestructure of the bodies and in the legislative procedure, that oneneed not wonder if an ever stronger movement urged for simplification.Furthermore, the constitution in itself had something unclarified,something provisional and that in severe respects and that alwayshappens if a dualism is created; for every dualism of power endeavorsat its own dissolution. * * * We had, furthermore, the small dualismbetween Reich President and Reich Chancellor; and, I havent mentionedthat yet, there was the old grave German problem of dualism betweenReich and Laender; all these various problems of dualism were urgingfor dissolution and they were in process of dissolution prior toHitler. Hitler then completed that development. May I explain that in afew remarks?First of all, the dualism between Reichstag and Reich President wasabolished. The Reich President is the victor. Under Hindenburg theformation of the cabinet more and more came under the power of theReich President and that of the Reichstag decreased. The end of thisdevelopment was 30 January 1933. The Reichstag was no longer asked todo any work. Purely formally, under article 53, the president appointsthe new government. Article 54 was no longer considered a seriousthreat. The parliamentary system is dead and we have the first demotingof the Reichstag. The second had already started in the meantime, asI have shown. The Reichstag had already resigned more and more as alegislative body; it is only the culmination of the development, whatwe see in the law of 24 March 1933 [Enabling Act] and the aftermath,the new reconstruction law [Neuaufbaugesetz] of 30 September 1934; thedivision of powers is dead. The Reichstag in its original and foremostfunction has been dethroned. What was its purpose now? In July 1933,political parties were definitely prohibited. A genuine parliamentwas no longer possible. The first Reichstag elected after this Julylaw, in November 1933, was the Reichstag of one faction only electedby voters of one party only. It has been said that it was purely anassembly of acclamation. The great dualism in the Reich ended therebyand on the grave of the Reichstag there are three crosses. The smalldualism between Reich President and Reich Chancellor ended with thedeath of Hindenburg and is expressed in the law of 1 August 1934,concerning the head of State [Staatsoberhaupt-Gesetz]. The greatest andmost serious dualism between Reich and Laender in effect was eliminatedbefore that. Usually one says in the German constitutional science thatonly the reorganization law of 30 January 1934 had turned the Laenderinto Reich provinces but that is certainly not correct. Looking at thefacts themselves, that step was already taken by the Reich governorlaw [Reichsstatthaltergesetz] of 7 April 1933. When one summarizes allthat and looks at those results together, the final phase is this--theentire power of the State in the German Reich is combined in the handof that one man who quite arbitrarily can use that power to decideindividual cases or to set new norms. It depends only on him, from thepractical point of view of power, as to how long he refrained frominterfering in the field of judiciary. * * *Q. Professor, that was the question about the development up to thepoint when this one man, Hitler, held everything in his hand. Iwould say the result of historical development. We are interested inexplaining to the Tribunal, if I may say so, the dogmatical position ofthe Hitler decree as a legislator. Therefore, my question concerningyour statements up to now concerned the development of constitutionallaw up to that historical point. But now, the Hitler decree and the actof lawmaking became actually one and the same. What was the effectof that on the legislative, on the executive, and on all forms of thestate life after that time?A. Perhaps I may begin with the procedure of the Hitler decrees,that is to say, with the exterior manifestations. I have shown thatin German constitutional law we had the difference between statute,in the formal sense, and ordinance. The one was the act of thelegislature--the other of the executive. On account of the enablingact and as a consequence of the first acts of the Hitler government,the procedure of legislation became a dual one. We still had more orless--for Sundays only, so to speak--the procedure of legislationthrough the Reichstag. The normal course of legislation was thestatutes enacted by the Reich government, which should not have beencalled that way. We also had, from the imperial days, and we kept itup during the days of the president, the decree by the head of state,especially distinguished in the way of ordinance, for instance theorganization act and we had the ordinance by the government. Hitler, byand by--but it happened rather quickly--emancipated himself from thoseregulations of the laws which were previously valid and concerningthe various forms of norms, he used them arbitrarily. As to whether astatute passed by the Reichstag, as I described it, was brought in bysuggestion of the National Socialist Party with Hitler as the firstmover of the motion, was passed by way of acclamation, without debate;or whether the law was decided on by the government--that happened veryquickly by way of circulation--or whether Hitler called it Decreeby the Fuehrer and Reich Chancellor--later called Fuehrer Decreeor ordinance, such as the famous ordinance on the Enforcement of theFour-Year Plan--for the legal value that did not matter at all. Inall cases Hitler alone decided, whether he would take advice or not,whether there was a cosignature or not, for genuine cosignature in theconstitutional meaning, of course, could not exist any more. There havebeen many arguments as to what the cosignatures which werent alwaysaffixed meant. People have tried very hard to find a meaning, but theonly thing that is really certain is that these cosignatures did nolonger have the meaning or significance of the proper countersignature.There was nobody toward whom one could have assumed any responsibilityby countersigning. Therefore, all fixing of norm, signed by Hitlersname alone or together with other names, is merely an act of will ofthat man--whether it calls itself a law or something else.The only difficulty is represented by the so-called secret laws,although I cant quite see where the difficulties are when you look atit properly; that a law which is kept secret before the people whomit concerns cannot bind those people is obvious. That is not becauseof some particular legal system but that is because of the very natureof an order. Nobody can be given an order if he doesnt know of theorder and if he is not meant to have knowledge of that order. But onemust not forget that if Hitler passed a secret law, that as an officialdirective it was binding for those persons to whom it was made known.Then it was not just a legal norm, but it was an official instruction.As for the citizen, that amounted to the same in effect. If I may usean expression from Germanic law, these various forms by which Hitlerannounced his will were only different as far as the number of peoplein his entourage were concerned.Much more difficult than that question about the form is the questionabout the restrictions on those contents to which Hitler was subject asa legislator. According to the valid order, limitations in the matterof the contents existed also for Hitler. Already last year, before theInternational Military Tribunal, I stated clearly that naturally forHitler too, the limitations of ethics did apply. As to how he himselfthought about such matters, I dont know. I never met him, and I wouldnot like to rely on hearsay; but that he knew that others believed himbound by a moral restriction, that is quite evident from the fact thatagain and again, be it in preambles to the law, be it by the rest ofthe propaganda machinery, he formulated moral justifications. Whetherthat was in accordance with his own real ideas, that question may beleft open.But I have already told the Tribunal that these restrictions, as moralrestrictions which are no doubt for a great man the most difficult andthe most important restrictions, in the conception of the Europeanstate on legal matters, are no legal restrictions. The absolute stateof the continent passed on that conception to its parliamentarysuccessor.A little while ago, I had an occasion to show, by the example ofAnschuetz, that that remained so until the latest era, until the timeof the extreme democratic era of the Weimar republic. If one doesregret that or not does not matter here. I simply have to describe whatactually happened. If now, in the European meaning, one asks aboutlegal restrictions--and first of all one asks about restrictions of theGerman law--one will have to say that restrictions under German law didnot exist for Hitler. He was _legibus solutus_ in the same meaningin which Louis XIV claimed that for himself in France. Anybody who saidsomething different expresses a wish that does not describe the actuallegal facts.On the other hand, certainly there were legal restrictions forHitler under international law. He, as the head of the State, wasthe representative of the German Reich with foreign countries. Afterthe development of affairs, he had to represent the German Reichwithout the restrictions which the Reich President still had. Hitleralone concluded the treaties and terminated them. He alone concludedalliances and could renounce them. He was bound by international law.Therefore, he could commit acts violating international law. He couldissue orders violating international law to the Germans.Now we are confronted with the most difficult problem: What were theconsequences of the violation of international law by an act or aninstruction by Hitler? The nonjurists will probably say that the orderdid not exist. But every jurist knows everywhere in the world thatmatters for the state, for every state, are not so simple. It is nottrue that there is even one state in the world which would say, Everywrong act of state is not an act of state at all, but every governmentsystem had inherent in itself, in varying form, a second order so tospeak--a kind of self-purification system--a system concerned withfinding out whether faulty acts of state are void or valid or are onlypartly valid. Every state commits faulty acts--acts of which everybodyknows that they are not in order and knows it at a certain time. Actswhich all the same are maintained, merely because during a legalprocedure the end has to come one day.In the Germany of the Weimar republic, for example, this is whathappened. When the Reichstag--I just showed it by the example ofAnschuetz--had passed a bill pursuant to article 76, that is, with amajority which could change the constitution, that law, if it had beenproperly promulgated, was binding for every official agency, even, forexample, if it did not comply with an obligation of the Reich underinternational law.In this commentary--would you kindly wait a moment--its a long timesince I looked at it last, but I think I can remember where it is.[Reading] Anschuetz says in his commentary on article 10, under figure7, International law too, places an obligation on the German judgewithin the meaning of article 102 and according to article 4, but onlyinsofar as it is generally recognized; in particular, also recognizedby the German Reich and does not contradict the Reich laws. Whetherthat is the case, that the judge has to examine but he does not haveto examine Reich laws, for the fact whether they are or are not inaccordance with international law, and even if they dont pass thisexamination, he cannot deny their application. That means if theReichstag, let us say, with a majority that can change the constitutionhad passed a law which was contradicting international law, that lawwas binding for all German official agencies. The Reich had to actas a sovereign State under the international law governing offensesagainst international law.I return to Hitler. What applied to the democratic set-up applied allthe more to the set-up under a leader, and everybody knows that whoknew about the conditions surrounding Hitlers decisions. If Hitlerissued an order which was faulty from the legal point of view, that didnot give the German official agencies any reason to refuse obedience,for in every state there has to be an authority beyond whom there is noappeal.In the case of Hitler something else, something special applies. Hewho sees things differently and believes that the German officialagencies were not merely entitled but perhaps even under an obligationto examine Hitlers orders as to their legality not from the scientificpoint of view, but merely with the practical purpose of possiblyrefusing obedience, claims no more, no less than that Germany had nodictatorship at all. Then it would not be comprehensible what was thesense of a fight of the whole world against that regime.I believe I have now answered your question. I would like to say onemore thing, so as to emphasize the gravity of the development. I hadthe permission to show the Tribunal the structure of the acts of theState. Naturally that structure can also be applied to Hitlers acts,but only one of those acts lost its meaning almost completely underHitler. If Your Honors will kindly recall chart 1 to your memories,where on the left side we had the norms and then the authorizationnorms, the norms which authorized interference, I had differentiatedbetween special and general relationship or subordination--pointing tothe soldier and the citizen.[153] Those differentiations under Hitlergradually lose meaning. Hitler exerted and overburdened the strengthof the German people to such an extent that finally he no longersaw before him citizens and smaller groups of persons under specialobligation among them, but for him the Germans, all Germans were alwayson duty. A private sphere of activity no longer existed for him. Withhim there is no meaning in the differentiation between substantive lawsand official instructions. It is all the same to him. The citizen isdead, because all have become officials. That is the final point of adevelopment which, from a complicated state of affairs, was workingtowards simplicity, and that is the gruesome result.PRESIDING JUDGE BRAND: Dr. Schilf, would you pardon a questiondirected to the witness at this time? Dr. Jahrreiss, if this questioninterferes with the orderly course of your presentation, I suggestthat you ignore it. But you told us in your discussion of procedureyour views as to decrees signed by Hitler and one or more ministers.Would you care to specify or to indicate to us a little the view youhave with reference to the justification of authority decrees notsigned by Hitler, but signed by one or more of the ministers? I thinkwe have seen a good many of those in the record. In other words,decrees executed or signed only by various of the ministers, but not byHitler. Do you understand my question?WITNESS JAHRREISS: Yes, thank you. I have spoken so faronly about orders by Hitler, but in German constitutional law datingback to the days of the monarchy and the Weimar republic we have notonly norms fixed by the Reichstag or the head of the State, but alsomany norms laid down by the government, in the narrower sense by theminister. The ordinance [Verordnung], of which I spoke in the beginningdifferentiating it from the statutes passed by legislators, isnormally the ordinance of a minister, and under German constitutionallaw the following is valid. That was not changed in the Hitler era.Administrative ordinances, that is to say, norms which are not legalprinciples in the narrower meaning, are issued by every minister withinthe framework of his own department, without any special basis. Otherordinances, that is to say, legal ordinances, can only be issued--hecan issue them, but he can only issue them if he has been authorized todo so by the constitution or by a legislative act. That was, in fact,what I described at the beginning. And so, in the Weimar era, we hadmany ministerial ordinances if the law empowered the minister to issuethem. If I may add this, the result of that differentiation was this,if the courts had to apply an ordinance by a minister, or to be moreprecise, when it was doubtful whether it was to be applied, then thecourt had to examine whether the minister was empowered, was authorizedto issue it. If the court denied that question, the ordinance did notexist. May I ask whether this was in answer to your question, YourHonor?PRESIDING JUDGE BRAND: I was interested especially in thesource of authority, of decrees signed by various ministers afterHitler came into power. Would it be accurate to say that such decreesreceived their validity because of a delegation of power to theminister directly from Hitler?WITNESS JAHRREISS: Yes, for legal ordinances. Hitler was thelegislator. He could issue the ordinances himself but he could alsodelegate authority.DR. SCHILF: Professor, I should like to follow up your words.In the Hitler state, so to speak, all people were on duty. Therewere no longer any citizens. You said the citizen was dead. May I askyou, in our legal language we call an order by a phrase which is veryconcise and which might explain it better to the Tribunal, that the lawalso in the former meaning was a law that was the same as an order toa servant. May I ask you to tell me whether that general instructionto an official, a civil servant, to a servant was the same as the lawwhich had been solemnly promulgated in the Reichsgesetzblatt?WITNESS JAHRREISS: If I have understood your questionproperly, you want to know whether the obligation was the same?Q. Yes.A. Yes, no doubt. For those who were concerned, those to whom the orderwas addressed, the order issued by Hitler, whether it was concernedwith an individual case or whether that was a legal norm or whether itwas an official instruction, was binding.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *DR. SCHILF: Now I want to ask you, what, in principle, was therelation between international law and the law of the individual state,and I would like to ask you whether that relationship was changed underthe Hitler state?WITNESS JAHRREISS: Counsel, I suppose I am right in assumingthat by that question you refer mainly to Article 4[154] of the Weimarconstitution?Q. Yes, that is my intention.A. Among the methods by which human beings are directed in socialintercourse, there is, as one of several, the order [Befehl]. That initself, unsympathetic as it appears to people everywhere as a method,has the one characteristic that it is unavoidable. Consequently, thereis nowhere among human beings a sphere where there is no rule. On theother hand, all mankind in effect today stands in permanent relation oflife with one another without, as a whole, being subject to one rule.Both together result in the situation which again and again worriespeople, which we call the situation referring to international law.Only groups of mankind, smaller groups or larger groups, are under acommon rule. Therefore, if a continuous life, in spite of being dividedinto various units of rule, is to be made secure, and that in a propermanner, then there must be norms which hold together in an entity thosevarious units of rules.Or to express it in a different way, the power of authority of thevarious units must be brought in line in such a way that a communitylife is possible. That means, however, the ruling authority of theindividual units must be restricted by the whole. The central pointof international law is therefore constituted by those norms whichlay down that limitation of the authority of the individual groups.Therefore, I suggested, and I was the first person to demonstrate thatin science, that the law of an individual state, that is to say theconstitutional law, should never be described without also describingthe limitations under international law. If we were to achieve thesituation, if I may say so here, whereby everywhere in the world allyoung jurists from the very beginning would be accustomed to see theconstitutional questions of their own country always in connection withthose of international law, then a great deal would have been done tostrengthen international law.Summarizing, that means the individual state is placed under anobligation by international law to arrange its own order by legislationin such a manner that the authorities in their decisions work in sucha way as is demanded by international law. In [legal] science, thatis called--the state is under an obligation to organize its law inaccordance with international law. How can that be done?There are several methods available. The legislator can, from case tocase in his own system, amend those provisions which need changingso as to comply with international law. He does not need to mentioninternational law at all in doing so. That is the way states proceedagain and again. A different method is the one which is called themethod of transformation. That is, the legislator does not trouble tobring into line the law of his country, word by word, and paragraph byparagraph, with international law, but he tells his official agencies,Consider the norm of international law which in itself only binds me,as if I had cast it into a law.That method, which in German we also call Recasting [Umgiessung], canbe applied specifically or generally. That is to say, the legislator,as soon as he has to consider a new treaty under international law, canrecast that treaty or he gives general instructions for the applicationof the international law which is valid in the particular case. Bothmethods have been used among states.Concerning this method of transformation, a difficult problem arises.In all states which have laws of different rank, as in the GermanReich under the Weimar constitution--that is to say, either lawswhich have the validity of the constitutional laws, or ordinarylaws--the legislator has to ask himself whether he intends to applythe recast international law to the highest group or not. Under theWeimar constitution, for example, it was indisputable that the recastinternational law had merely the position of an ordinary law. Theremight even be a state which would place the recast internationallaw above constitutional law. What do we need that for? Everyofficial agency in every state finds itself in the situation whereit is confronted with several laws of its own state which appear tocontradict one another, or in fact do contradict one another, which,however, all claim validity. I need not tell you jurists that sincethe days of Roman law everywhere norms have developed concerning theelimination of such conditions; where state laws have varying status,further norms of collision have been constituted. If a state would havea general norm under which international law takes precedence over alldomestic law, that would be the greatest safeguard which is possibleat all, that the law of the country is handled in accordance withinternational law. I do not know whether there is such a state. TheGerman Reich at any rate was not one of those states. I think with thisbackground I can now answer your question.The relation between international law and the law of the Reich hasbeen regulated in the Weimar constitution in article 4 and article45, paragraph 3.[155] There have been many arguments about article4, at the time when the national [Constituent] assembly was sitting[in 1919]. After many arguments and after sufficient attention hadbeen paid to article 45, paragraph 3, eventually the following legalsituation evolved. As far as the German Reich, by treaty, enters intoobligations under international law, in such spheres of life which aresubject to the legislative authority of the Reichstag, the President ofthe Reich may not ratify the treaty for Germany before the Reichstaghas agreed by law. That is a transformation of a special nature, andanticipated transformation, for if the treaty is concluded, because theother partners ratify it also, then, at the moment the treaty becomesvalid, the special recasting has already been effected. For the rest,all other international law, as far as it is generally recognized, butalso acknowledged by Germany, is generally speaking recast by article4. Both ways of recasting gave international law the status of anordinary law of the Reich. Yesterday I had opportunity--concerning thequestion as to the moral limits of rule--to point out that under theWeimar constitution the courts were not authorized to examine a lawas for its validity under international law, and certainly not theadministrative authorities. Under Hitler that attitude was not changed.The general method of transformation of article 4 was kept on, and thespecific one was needed even less frequently because the approval ofthe Reichstag was no longer required for the conclusion of treaties.Hitler could conclude every treaty under international law himself.As soon as the treaty had been concluded, as soon as it had come intoforce, it had already been recast, for Hitlers ratification was, fromthe domestic point of view, a Fuehrer Order.Q. Professor, to supplement your explanations, may I ask you to readout to the Tribunal article 4 and also article 45, paragraph 3, so thatthe passages you mentioned become quite clear.A. Article 4 says: The generally recognized rules of international laware valid as binding constituent parts of the law of the German Reichlaw. Article 45 says: Alliances and treaties with foreign stateswhich refer to matters in which the Reich has legislative power requirethe consent of the Reichstag.Q. Another supplementary question, Professor. You told us that treatiesunder international law were concluded by Hitler alone. I would like toask you to explain to us how the question can be solved concerning theperson who was subject to Hitlers order if there were contradictions?A. I believe I understand your question to mean that among the laws orordinances which were valid in Germany at the time, there were somewhich were contradictory to that which Hitler had decreed concerningthe treaty. That is not a particular problem. I have already pointedout that that problem was merely the problem of collision, and ifHitler, in contradiction to the treaty he had concluded later on,issued an order in a general way or in a specific case contradictingthe former order, the later order, if the contents were the same,was to apply and the old maxim applied--_lex posterior derogatpriori_--that was so concerning the relations of the laws under theWeimar constitution, and it was the same under Hitler; but I think itwill be necessary for me to say a little more on that subject. It canhappen, and it does happen again and again, that a state knowingly,in its legislation, gets itself involved in a contradiction withinternational law. The last will of the state is decisive for theofficial agencies. In that case, the nation until that collision hasbeen eliminated, lives under constitutional law which contradictsinternational law. The settlement, which is bound to come, is broughtabout by international law by the state being regarded as one whichhas committed an offense under international law, and entails andholds that responsibility to the provisions of international law, andas quickly as possible that inconsistency has to be removed by laterlegislation. As to whether further consequences arise, that we neednot discuss here. In the case of every state the following applies.For the official agencies which have to apply the law to a certainspecific case, there are frequently, if one proceeds logically, severallaws--there are after all many situations in life which extend beyondthe frontiers from the human point of view or from the material pointof view.One can bear in mind that instead of the states own law or side byside with the law of that state, foreign law can be applied, or it maybe a case of church law possibly having to be applied. The questionas to the application of international law, therefore, belongs to awider scope of the great problem which is called the problem of thenorm concerning the application of law, or in other words in everylegal system there is, by the side of the system which regulates therelations between human beings as such, a system which instructs theauthorities as to which law they are to apply in each case. I do notknow of any state nor do I know what law could be possible which doesnot proceed in this way. The officials have to apply the law of thestate which is in force at the time except if the legislator admits ororders another solution. Consequently, the provision of the status ofrecast international law is, therefore, only one possibility of thevarious possibilities of applying international law.Q. Professor Jahrreiss, for the purpose of this trial we are interestedin establishing whether an official himself was confronted with thequestion that international law deviated from the state law. If hehimself was confronted with that situation, I want to ask you in whatdirection did he have the choice, or did he have any choice at all? Washe restricted to one norm according to the general view or to the viewof the Reich constitution as far as it was still in force under theHitler regime? Was he bound by that?A. First of all, I have to explain the underlying facts of yourquestion. Apparently you have in mind the case where a law or anindividual decision exists which, in the view of the official, isinconsistent with international law.Q. Inconsistent with international law, but which unilaterally isthe law of his country, and this official now is confronted with thequestion to what norm is he to adhere?A. I have already said that under the Weimar system which on that pointwas not changed under the Hitler regime the official had to apply therecast international law as an ordinary Reich law, and now he had tosolve that problem of collision which you have mentioned, in the sameway in which he solved the problem of collision between two ordinaryReich laws which were contradicting each other. In effect if the lawunder Hitler had been issued and afterwards the Reich assumed a newobligation under international law which was recast, then that had tobe applied and not the former law, and vice versa. Have I answered yourquestion?Q. Yes, but there was one more possibility for the imaginaryofficial. If the law of a country perhaps intentionally deviated frominternational law, what norm did the official then have to apply?A. I have already said that in the Weimar era already the moralbackground or the background of international law of a legislative actwas removed from the scrutiny of the official and even removed from thescrutiny of the judge and of the Reich Supreme Court. The background ofinternational law could not even be examined by the Staatsgerichtshof,[supreme constitutional court]. The supreme constitutional court wasonly allowed to examine whether it was constitutional, but it was notallowed to examine it from the point of view of international law. Toexpress it differently, whether the law had been passed by the State insuch a way that it was inconsistent with international law on purposeor not, that could not play any part at all; and that was the legalstate of affairs, regrettable as it may be.Q. For the purpose of our trial we are particularly interested in thenorm of the Hague Convention of Land Warfare. May I ask you to explainto the Tribunal with special reference to whether the principles oftransformation which you have explained apply to the Hague Conventionof Land Warfare as well?A. Counsel, with that question you have approached a particularlydifficult problem. You know that the validity of the Hague Conventionof Land Warfare also concerning the clause of general participationhas very often been doubted. The Hague Convention of Land Warfarewith us was recast, and specifically--that cannot be doubted in myview--most of what is said in the Hague Convention should be consideredas recast pursuant to article 4 of the constitution even if a specificrecasting did not occur. That follows from the history preceding theHague Convention of Land Warfare. When the parties to the treaty,among them the German Reich, in 1907 signed the Convention ConcerningLand Warfare, for the most part they only laid down in law suchpoints which in any case were already international laws by customsand, therefore, assured. It would not always be easy to say whether aprovision of the Hague Convention belongs to that group in part or notor as a whole. Have I answered your question correctly?Q. I would like you to refer to article 1 of the Hague Convention andto read it to the Tribunal.A. Yes. You mean article 1 of the Convention, or the appendix? Article1 of the Convention you mean. Very often when one talks of the HagueConvention of Land Warfare, one means the appendix. Article 1 isa particularly concise example for the fact that the states wereconscious of the character of international law such as I described,because it places the states under an obligation to give instructionsto their land armies which are in accordance with the enclosed HagueConvention. As to the methods they employ, they are left open to thevarious states. For example, the German Reich could without mentioningthe Hague Convention have passed a German law as to the behavior of theGerman army in wartime. It was technically easier to give the order topay attention to the Hague Convention in the event of war. And thus,the points laid down in the treaty as international law, and whichin the proper meaning do not affect the individual human being butonly bind the state as a whole, were reinterpreted by the legislativeauthority to mean regulations applying to the conduct of the individual.Q. Thank you, that answers the question.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *Q. Professor, I had the opportunity to show you the book of HeinrichTriepel, International Law and State Law. I would like to submit to youpages 153 and 154 and ask you to read that part to the Tribunal and toexplain whether that is in accordance with your opinion.A. I have in front of me the book of Heinrich Triepel, InternationalLaw and State Law of 1899. This book--Q. Excuse me, Professor. Is it the first edition? I have just beenasked if there are several editions.A. No, there are not several. It is the first edition. This book, atthe time, was a sensational book for the science of international lawin the whole world. It was the first book which systematically treatedthe questions which I am supposed to supply information about heretoday. And what Heinrich Triepel laid down at that time basically hasbeen recognized in the entire science of international law and onlyafter the First World War a certain lack of security in theory, notin practice, developed because the so-called Vienna theory of law[Wiener Rechtsschule] founded by Hans Kelsen, who was my predecessorin Cologne, and who is now teaching in the United States, with itsso-called pure theory of law or norm logic conceived the thingslogically. This did not affect the practice of international law atall, and thus the sentence is applicable which Triepel formulated onpage 153 of this book, Judges and subjects are under the obligationto apply the law of the state, even if contrary to international law,and to follow it. It is not up to them, but up to the government totake into consideration the differences and the divergencies withinternational law which may arise out of this.DR. SCHILF: May it please the Tribunal, I have concluded myquestions to Professor Jahrreiss.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *_CROSS-EXAMINATION_       *       *       *       *       *       *       *MR. LAFOLLETTE: * * * I do want to ask you, Dr. Jahrreiss,a hypothetical question. You may not agree with the hypothesis whichI hypothesize or the implications perhaps inherent in them, but justfor my own purpose and for orderly procedure I ask you to consider myquestion and answer it on the basis of the facts which I hypothesize,purely. Let us assume that I was subject to the complete power of anindividual we will call A to force me to obey his orders implicitly;and, under those circumstances, I saw A procuring a strong rope,strong enough to bind a man completely and securely. Secondly, thatI saw him preparing a strong wooden frame upon the ground, with ironrings through which he could pass the rope; and, so placed, thatthey could bind the legs and arms of a man securely. Third--a woodenblock so shaped that a mans neck could be placed on it with his headextended beyond it. And four, that I saw this man A sharpening an axelarge enough and strong enough to cut through the neck of a man. Andsuppose at this same time I also saw, standing always in view, from oneto six men, each of whom I know that this man A has a violent hatredfor and has threatened to kill; and each of whom I know that this manA has the power to capture if he chooses. Now then, let us assumethat this man A captures one or more of these men that he hates,and that I know he hates; and binds this man with the rope that I sawhim prepare, upon the frame that I saw him build; and places his neckon the block that I saw him prepare; and that then A hands me theaxe which I saw him sharpen and orders me to cut off the head of thiscaptured, bound man. Would you say that under those circumstances Iwould be guilty or not guilty of killing the man whose head I severedat the direct order of A who had the full power to order me to do so.DR. JAHRREISS: I understand it this way--that guilty or notguilty is to be considered as guilt under criminal laws.Q. On the assumed facts, yes.A. I just want to ask you a question. Do you mean it as a legalquestion or as a question of morality?Q. As a question of law.A. Of law, yes. And according to what criminal law, and in what state?Q. You can name the state; I dont care.A. Well, is that supposed to be a question in Utopia?Q. Lets put it in Germany.A. In Germany?Q. In Germany, yes, after 1933.A. Yes, all right. Here then, we would be faced with terrible problemswith which all of us since last year have been torturing ourselves soterribly, and I confess that in spite of having thought about it agreat deal, that I have not yet found my way out of the dilemma intowhich we have been brought. Perhaps I can answer this hypotheticalquestion by saying, by stating first, the points of view which ina conflicting manner make the answer more difficult. Perhaps firstof all I should say, so that this should be clear, Mr. Prosecutor,how I, myself would behave.--I dont know. No matter how horriblethe whole thing is, I dont believe that I--well, the Charter of theInternational Military Tribunal anticipates that an appeal to higherorders should not be admissible. It is not my task to criticize thoseregulations. However, perhaps I may be allowed to say that thisregulation, if it should really be valid law in any state whatsoever,would have very dangerous consequences for order in general. One ofthe four judges of the IMT, the French judge, Donnedieu De Vabres,in a lecture which he gave this last April expressly stated thatthis regulation brings with it many difficulties for the idea of thediscipline imposed by the state. I have the text of his lecture here.It is a lecture which Professor Donnedieu De Vabres gave before theAssociation des Etudes Internationales Criminologiques. May I quote ashort passage from it? May I read it in French?THE INTERPRETER: Yes, you may.WITNESS JAHRREISS: Since the statute was interpreted this wayunder the rules imposed by the IMT, it has in a sense of individualismgone beyond regulations of international law and domestic law, thisregulation is open to the objection that it will endanger the necessarydiscipline for the preservation of the state. Such a regulation canbe applied in the future only with prudence and circumspection. Iam quoting this here only in order to demonstrate that if any rulesexist at all, a certain harshness is absolutely necessary, unavoidablynecessary. I always told my young students who started out on a studyof law that they would have to devote themselves to perhaps the mostbitter fact in life of man, and that is the rule, because by nature manhates the rulership, at least if he is subjected to it, but if thisis the case every state basically has to require that its laws areexecuted, even if the person concerned, for moral or religious reasons,or other reasons, is of a different opinion. On the other hand, Mr.LaFollette, every state knows that there is some limitation somewhere.For example, the German Reich had a military penal law. In it there wasthe quoted article 47. In the jurisdiction of the Reich court, however,this paragraph was applied more and more in a restricting sense becausediscipline had to be above all.Now, Mr. Prosecutor, before the IMT, I, in the expert opinion which Igave, which you were kind enough to quote here, stated expressly andemphatically, I believe, what the limit of humaneness or humanity is,but at the same time I pointed out that this limit is frequently notsharply drawn; and I believe, and this comes closer to your question,that perhaps after all the problem with which we are concerned herecannot quite be done justice to, if a case is described quite asdrastic as you just said.Last year during the first 4 months of the trial I experienced it, andthose were the most difficult times of my entire life. I experiencedand saw what terrible things happened under Hitlers regime, and I haveno way to express my horror and to describe this sufficiently in anylanguage, but I believe that you will agree with me if I say that thoseare occurrences which are outside of legal discussion entirely, for,Mr. Prosecutor, even about injustice one can, if one is exact, speakwith legal reasons only in cases where--excuse me--the injustice iswithin normal limits.I myself was a criminal judge. One single murder frequently, in thecourt of assize, occupied our time for 2 to 3 weeks, and it was aterrible thing. Two murders by one person--that was horrifying. Ifsomeone had eight to ten murders on his conscience, then he wasdescribed as a mass murderer in the press of Europe, and people askedthemselves whether this was something that could be handled by means ofthe penal code at all.When, last year, in the courtroom of the big trial I listened tothe witness, Hoess, of Auschwitz, when he answered the question ofthe prosecutor as to how many people he had killed, if I remembercorrectly, he answered he didnt remember exactly whether two and ahalf or three million. At that time it was quite obvious to me thatneither positively nor negatively this had anything to do anymore withlegal considerations because, Mr. Prosecutor, no matter what a stateregulates concerning the question of review of a law the state has tothink of normal conditions. These occurrences and matters cannot bemeasured by any order of the world at all. Therefore, I believe thatthese things that happened in Germany behind a complicated system ofsecrecy, a system of mutual delimitation, and if then one adds thepressure of conscience of millions of people who felt themselves hemmedin between patriotism and hatred of the system, then the question whichyou put to me attains a very bitter human weight, and I can only say Idont know any way out.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *PRESIDING JUDGE BRAND: In order to better understand yourviews which you have ably expressed, I would like to ask you a fewquestions. I understand your view to be that judges were obligedto obey the law of their State of Germany even though in doing sothey violated a principle of international law. That is a fair briefstatement, is it not, of the matter?WITNESS JAHRREISS: Yes. During the Weimar republic this wasalready uncontestedly applicable, and with the permission of theTribunal, I read the commentary of Anschuetz to article 102.Q. And you would apply the same principle after 1933, would you not?A. After 1933? There was much less the question whether this wasdifferent than before.Q. What court or tribunal ordinarily enforced the rule that judges mustobey the law of their State under such circumstances? I assume theanswer is obvious.A. Excuse me. I didnt understand your question, sir.Q. What tribunal ordinarily enforced against the judges or upon thejudges this obligation to obey the law of the State even though they indoing so, violated international law?A. I never heard that a court violated this principle so that therewas no need to force the judges to conform to it. Mr. President, Inever heard that a German court did not apply a Reich law because inthe opinion of the court it was contrary to international law. I neverheard of such a case. You see, it was entirely uncontested. The court,just in such a case, couldnt do anything but through official channelscall the attention of the government to this contradiction so that thegovernment, in accordance with its obligation under international law,would see to it that the laws were changed. Let us assume the case thatthe Reich Supreme Court, for example, in deciding a case had come tothe conclusion that a German Reich law was contrary to an obligationof the Reich under international law. Then the Reich Supreme Court wasnot able to say--the indictment is refused because the Reich law whichsupports the indictment is contrary to international law. The ReichSupreme Court could do nothing but either to postpone the trial and toreport to the government so that perhaps changes would be made in time,but it was not even obliged to do that. It was obliged only if it didmake a decision to decide in accordance with national law if it wascontrary to the international law. That was the legal situation duringthe Weimar republic.Q. That answers my question. * * * The Reich Supreme Court would inproper cases lay down the rule that the lower court judge shouldenforce the German law even though it violated some principle ofinternational law for which Germany as a state might be diplomaticallyheld responsible, is that true?A. No, that is not quite correct. I said that the Reich Supreme Court,just the same as the other German courts, in regard to this question,did not have any doubts at all, and therefore, it did not make anyrules with which the lower courts had to comply. That was not necessaryat all.Q. Then the lower courts themselves recognized this rule of whichyou speak that they must enforce the law of the State even though itviolates a principle of international law?A. Yes, and they only had to look at the Anschuetz commentary; thatsaid so expressly.Q. Well, at least prior to 1918, was there any tribunal other than thecourt of the state which could punish the public officer or a judge,for making a decision which was contrary to international law, if itwas made in compliance with the law of the state?A. No.Q. If the principle enunciated among other bodies by the firsttribunal, the IMT Tribunal, namely, the principle of the penalresponsibility of an individual officer for violations of internationallaw, should be applied, then you have, do you not, a modification ofyour principle which you have stated with reference to the necessitythat judges must obey the law of the state. In other words, if thatprinciple of penal responsibility of the individual has become a partof international law, then the anomalous situation would arise wherethe officer, perhaps the judge, may have been required by his statelaw to make a decision, but may, nevertheless, be responsible if anytribunal has jurisdiction to try him, for a decision contrary tointernational law. Isnt that true?A. If I understood your question correctly, Your Honor, the generalvalidity of the principles of the charter as international lawcould, in regard to judges of those states which require that theirofficials apply the law of the state as the final will, bring abouttragic conflicts of conscience, for which, in my opinion, there is noindubitable legal solution at all. But, Mr. President, I do not knowwhether I quite understand your question correctly.Q. I do not think I will attempt to repeat it further. I understoodyour position. It is true, is it not, that there was no tribunal inGermany, perhaps anywhere else, which had statutory jurisdiction toapply international law in a penal proceeding against a public officerof the state who had complied with the state law?A. Yes, that is correct.Q. Then, if there were a tribunal that had jurisdiction to apply thatlaw, might it not perhaps, arrive at a different decision, legally,from the decision which this court of the state itself, would arriveat; might not an international tribunal, having jurisdiction to passupon the question, arrive at a different answer as to criminality ofan individual officer who had violated international law, but had notviolated the law of the state?A. Yes, that would be so, but, Mr. President, if I may say so, thatis the very thing which I call the tragic situation of the officialconcerned.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *            E. General Development of the Administration of                         Justice under Hitler                    EXTRACTS FROM THE TESTIMONY OF                     DEFENDANT SCHLEGELBERGER[156]DR. KUBUSCHOK (counsel for defendant Schlegelberger): Witness,what is your career, your professional career in particular?DEFENDANT SCHLEGELBERGER: I was born in 1875. After I hadfinished my legal studies and had passed my doctors examination, Ibecame judge in the first and second instance. In 1904 I became judgeof the Lyck District Court in East Prussia. In 1909 I became assistantat the Prussian Court of Appeals, Kammergericht. In 1914 I becameKammergerichtsrat. The Kammergericht is the Court of Appeals of Berlin,the highest court in Prussia.At the Kammergericht, I worked in several senates: in the civil senatewhich dealt with the ordinary cases of civil law; in the commercialsenate; in the patent senate, and in the senate for voluntaryjurisdiction. During that period I wrote my first scientific works inthat field which dealt with the experiences I have gained in practice.In 1918, that is to say at the end of the First World War, I becameassistant at the then Reich Justice Office which later on became theReich Ministry of Justice. That agency had very little to do withadministrative tasks. At that time, it only dealt with one court. Itwas the highest court, in fact the Reich Supreme Court in Leipzig.Apart from that, the Reich Justice Office only dealt with legislativetasks.As an assistant, I was put in charge of legislative preparatory workin the field of commercial and economic law, and I continued to dothat work when after a few months I became Geheimer Regierungsratand Vortragsrat at the Reich Justice Office. When in 1927 I becameministerial director, I still continued to deal with the same tasks.In 1931, the only Under Secretary of the Reich Justice Office, Dr.Joel, an old gentleman--not to be confused with the defendant Joel--wasappointed minister, and I took his position as Under Secretary. Iretained that position when in 1932 the Bruening cabinet was replacedby the Papen cabinet, and when Guertner, who had previously beenMinister of Justice of Bavaria became Reich Minister of Justice. ReichMinister Joel, as well as Reich Minister Guertner at that time dealtwith penal matters themselves. I merely dealt with matters of civil law.Only when in 1934 the Prussian Ministry of Justice was merged with theReich Ministry of Justice, and now a vast number of administrativetasks were transferred to the Reich Ministry of Justice, then a newUnder Secretary position was created, and that for penal matters.The Under Secretary of the former Prussian Ministry, Under SecretaryFreisler, obtained that post. That division of tasks in civil and penalmatters remained in force when on 27 January 1941 quite suddenly ReichMinister of Justice Guertner died, and I, as the most senior UnderSecretary, was placed in charge of the conduct of affairs. I retainedmy civil cases and Freisler dealt with penal matters. I was placed incharge of the conduct of affairs of the ministry as the senior UnderSecretary. I was never appointed Deputy Minister of Justice, and Inever had myself called so, because that was, of course, impossible. Ionly was in charge of the conduct of affairs.This picture, that is to say, that I merely acted as a representative,but that I actually dealt with the same work which I had dealt withbefore, that became also outwardly apparent. On purpose, I never workedin the Ministers office; I never moved into the Ministers home; andI drew the salary of an Under Secretary, not that of a Minister. On 20August 1942, at my own request, I resigned.Q. You have described your work as Under Secretary, and you have saidthat you worked largely in the sphere of civil law. Which were the mostimportant tasks with which you dealt?       *       *       *       *       *       *       *A. In accordance with the particular interest which I had alwayshad in economic matters, and in accordance with the work I haddone previously, I was allotted the task of cooperating during twoparticularly fateful years of the German Reich in the maintenance ofsupport of the economic life of the country. It was the stabilizationand maintenance of currency: that was in 1923 because of, and untilthe end of, the inflation, and later on in 1933 on the occasion ofthe economic collapse. The inflation period was followed by theestablishment of the Rentenmark currency, a new currency which replacedthe paper mark. The inflation was also followed by the ordinance atwhich I worked, under which businessmen had to draw up a balancein gold marks, and it was also followed by the tremendous task ofremonetization legislation. The collapse of the banks necessitatedmany discussions and consultations, and ordinances as for instanceconcerning rates of interest. Later, I worked on the new law concerningdrafts and checks, and I may quote as my special work the two bigeconomic laws promulgated in 1937, the law on shares and the law onpatents. When in 1942 I resigned from my office, a new law on companieswith limited liability was just about to be issued. At that time thegeneral reform of civil law had been started, not immediately by way ofa new codification, but by individual laws. When I left my office, themarriage law and the testament law were completed.Q. Apart from your professional work as a judge, and later on asan official in the Ministry, did you ever engage in any scientificresearch work?A. I can wholeheartedly affirm that question. Immediately after I tookmy state examination, I started on my first big project, and the firstbook of mine, which appeared in 1904, was a treatise on the law ofretention; it was a work of historical nature. At that time I intendedto take on a university career, but nothing came of that, because myhome university, Koenigsberg, did not create a new chair for commercialand economic law. But I could not give up my literary work, and eversince then that has occupied me consistently side by side with myofficial work. The special fields with which I dealt were economiclaw and voluntary jurisdiction, that is to say the law concerning theprocedure in matters concerning family, hereditary, commercial lawand document regulations. In 1923 I became Honorary Professor at theUniversity of Berlin. Naturally, I followed that call while retainingmy official position, and I held lectures at the University of Berlinuntil the outbreak of the war. In 1925 the University of Koenigsbergconferred upon me an honorary doctors degree of political science.Q. Did you also deal with foreign law?A. Yes, foreign law, too, has occupied me intensively for a longtime. Perhaps I may first mention one of my latest works, a largecomparative encyclopedia, the Manual of Comparative Civil andCommercial Law. That book summarizes reports on civil and commerciallaw of all countries, written mostly by national experts, and I maysay the law of the United States is dealt with by Professor Atkinsonof Kansas University. This work which necessitated a tremendous amountof correspondence, brought me in touch with eminent jurists allover the world. I have deepened those contacts since 1929, becauseI went abroad to hold lectures, and those trips were above all togive me an opportunity to observe the effect of the law, at leastin some countries, actually on the spot. I did succeed in doing soin Argentina; in Chile, where I dealt especially with banking laws,I wrote an essay on that subject; and in Brazil where I became anhonorary member of the Brazilian Lawyers Association. I held lecturesin Budapest, Madrid, Warsaw, Stockholm, Copenhagen. I should like toadd that I am coeditor of the periodical Foreign and InternationalPrivate Law, a publication of the Kaiser-Wilhelm Association; and,also coeditor of a publication on Scandinavian law.[157]       *       *       *       *       *       *       *Q. Witness, were you active in party politics?A. No, I never joined any party; I always stayed away from politics.My life was devoted to the practical administration of justice, and tolegal research. If looking back now, I should say which one of partiesof the German people I fitted into, I would call myself as belongingto the right one of the progressive, conservative direction which waspromoted by the German Peoples Party, [Deutsche Volkspartei] and whichwas also represented by the German Nationalist Party [Deutsch-NationaleVolkspartei].Q. What was your attitude towards the NSDAP and national socialism?A. In 1933 I was approached on the subject of joining the NSDAP; Irefused. My reason was, first the fact that I could not subscribe tothe program of the NSDAP. Furthermore, another reason was my viewthat Under Secretary of justice should remain neutral even on thesurface and, therefore, must not be obliged to any parties. I wasnever a National Socialist. It is obvious that a party program, in itsmanifold aspects, has many a point which one can adopt; for example,the programs aim of bridging class differences, that is to say, thecreation of a true national community; that point I welcomed heartily,but, concerning the program of the NSDAP as a whole above all, the wayin which it was to be put into effect, that was far removed from my ownideas. My own conservative attitude as a human being and as a juristaccounted for that. It came as a great surprise to me when, on 30January 1938, the Fuehrers Chancellery informed me in a letter, signedby Bouhler, that Hitler had ordered that I was to join and be acceptedby the NSDAP. I said that that came as a great surprise to me. Imyself, like other Under Secretaries who had also come from the middleclasses, had never heard of that order, and it was impossible to refusebecause that would not merely have meant I would have given battle notonly to the Party, but the State itself. But I never departed fromthat view. The membership which was ordered against my will and forcedupon me, I never made use of. I never attended a Party conference ormeeting. Naturally, I did not hold any office in the Party either.Perhaps the fact that I never changed my attitude is also demonstratedby the fact that neither my wife nor my sons ever belonged to theParty. My social contacts, too, as far as they were not conditionedby official affairs, moved almost exclusively within the circles ofnon-Party members.Q. The Hitler order by which Schlegelbergers membership in the Partywas decreed will be submitted by me as Schlegelberger Document 34,Schlegelberger Exhibit 92,[158] as soon as the document books shallhave been completed.Witness, what effect did that attitude of yours have on your officialposition?A. I always saw to it that Party members and Party functionaries weretreated just like every other citizen. That played a part particularlyin personnel matters. I only appointed that person to an office who, inmy view, was properly qualified; and I refused to reward Party stars byappointing them to an office.On the other hand, the attitude of the Party toward the Ministry andmyself--and I shall have to come back to that later on--made greatdifficulties and brought about many inner conflicts.At this moment I should like to point out the case to which theprosecution referred concerning notaries and their hostile attitudeto the Party. They demonstrated it so obviously that when I came tohear of it in my official capacity I could not form a proper opinionon it. If I had tried to suppress those cases it would have beenunavoidable that the Party would interfere, which definitely would haveclaimed that the notaries had violated their duty of allegiance towardthe State and the head of the State. Perhaps the Party would havewelcomed it, because such opposition would have been a welcome cause todiscredit the administration of justice and to jeopardize my personnelpolicy, on which depended the fate of many officials.DR. KUBUSCHOK: The witness has referred to the case of thenotaries which, under Document NG-901, Prosecution Exhibit 436,[159]was submitted by the prosecution.PRESIDING JUDGE BRAND: What was the exhibit number?DR. KUBUSCHOK: Exhibit 436.The prosecution refers to your lecture held at Rostock University in1936.[160] That lecture is compared as to its aim with a speech byReich Jurist Leader Frank, and the prosecution sees in it an avowal ofnational socialism. Please give us some explanations about that speech.DEFENDANT SCHLEGELBERGER: Counsel, you have pointed out thatthat speech was made in 1936. Before I discuss the details about thatspeech I should like to say a few words as to how, at that time, onewas able at all to discuss political questions in public. It wasntthat way that, when National Socialist quarters laid down programpoints, one was allowed to make a frontal attack. I ignore altogetherthe point of personal danger that might have arisen for an opponent. Iwould not have fought shy of that danger, because a person who held theoffice which I held was in daily danger. However, such a frontal attackwould have resulted in the opposite of what I wanted to achieve, thatis an increase of the opposition against reasonableness.One had to look for opportunities which one could use, and for example,the locality had something to do with that. I chose the universityfor the place of my speech, and that had a decisive influence on myaudience. I had to see to it that the National Socialist ideas which Iwished to attack were beaten with their own weapons.The actual reason for my speech was the fact that Freisler againand again, before the public, pointed out that the Party programwas enforceable like law and was at least the framework of the law.Therefore, one was obliged to carry out that program immediately andcompletely.I do not think I need to enter into any details here as to what itwould have meant if that doctrine had been recognized. In the practiceof the judges it would have meant separation from all legal provisions;the Party program could have been applied at random everywhere. Itwould, so to speak, have been the roof law under the protection ofwhich, according to the wishes of those extreme National Socialists,legal life would have developed.It was my aim to point out that such a construction would not benecessary at all, that the existing laws would also do justice to thefact that Germany was now a state under National Socialist government.I must point out that the law adapts itself automatically to changedconditions of life and ideologies, and from that the standard and thespeed of legal changes are decided.I intended to put in the place of the revolutionary changes of law,advocated by Freisler, an evolutionary development of law. I basedmyself on the principle of the interior change of the legal system,a principle which, for the first time, I propounded already in 1929in one of my works where I also elucidated that principle. That wasat a time when one could really not say that I might have based myarguments on the National Socialist thought. The compromise laws,which had already been promulgated, I mentioned intentionally withoutevaluating them. That was how I had argued against that thesis, and Ibelieve had refuted it. I also used the opportunity to give my viewsconcerning other important topical questions as well. I turned againstthe interference with the carrying out of sentences which I consideredinadmissible. Due to previous incidents, I warned the judges againstcurrying favor with high Party officers. I appealed to the pride of thejudges and the consciousness of their independence. I also found reasonto turn against it that some jurists in an absolutely inconsideratemanner, placed their own egotistic endeavors in the foreground, anddid not show any understanding whatsoever for the sound idea of a truepeoples community.Generally, I used a tactic which I had employed repeatedly: I committedthe high Party leaders to adhere to many of their good words whichthey had probably spoken without reflection. I reminded them thatHitler during his first speech before the Reichstag had declared theindependence of the judges as necessary. I pointed out that Frank[161]had mentioned the internal value of justice; and, that Goering, inpublic, had spoken against interference with the administration ofjustice.Q. What was your relationship with Hitler?A. I believe that one must distinguish between the personal and thematerial evaluation, and at the same time one must connect the two. Ibelieve that Hitler, concerning my own person, had a certain measureof respect. I believe he saw in me the experienced civil servant, whowas without ambitions, and who devoted himself to work and research.Concerning my sphere of work, civil law, he had not the slightestinterest in it. The fact that I was unpolitical, aroused a certainamount of distrust in him; that, I suppose, explains the fact that incontrast to civil servants of the same rank, I was never offered anhonorary position either in the SS or the SA. That I, in contrast toother high civil servants of the same rank, was not awarded the GoldenParty Badge; and that he restricted my connection with the Party tothe absolute minimum, again explains in particular, I believe, thepositively brutal attack on me in the well-known Reichstag speech of26 April 1942. The fact that I was placed in charge of affairs afterthe death of Guertner certainly was not a demonstration of confidence.This is how I would like to put it: It was just a makeshift solution.At that time Hitler could not yet make up his mind to appoint a newMinister of Justice. What played a certain part, perhaps, was thatthe chief candidate for the office, Frank, was at that time GovernorGeneral of the Government General and was not available. Thus, therewas no way out, but to let the Ministry put the Under Secretary, whohad seniority in the office, in charge of the Ministry. Hitlersdistrust, as far as I was concerned, was altogether justified froman objective point of view. I may say, and I wish to place specialemphasis on this, that I was never fooled or influenced by Hitlersdemoniacal qualities, and I saved my own conscience, as far as he wasconcerned. For myself, Hitler was the declared opponent, in fact,the person who held the administration of justice in contempt. Thatconviction naturally placed me in a clear position. As far as it didnot jeopardize my goal, I upheld my different opinion quite openlytoward Hitler. That was already the state of affairs at the time ofGuertner. I may say that all my life, as long as I held office, I wasout to fight for justice and against arbitrariness. In the avowalof justice there was no difference between Guertner and myself.Guertner was the recognized protector of justice, but he was nota fighter. If in the development, which was slow to begin with andlater became faster, he gave up his opposition in some respects, thatcertainly is not due to a lack of the honest will to uphold justice.Frequently he came to me for advice and assistance. But that time wasovershadowed by a continuous struggle with the Reich Jurists Leader[Reichsjustizfuehrer] Frank. In continuous attacks, Frank tried fromhis position as Reich legal office leader to achieve his final goalwhich was to get the office of Minister of Justice and then to changethe Ministry and make it into a National Socialist Ministry. Thatstruggle can only be understood if one knew who Frank was. Frank wasthe legal adviser and in difficult times the defense counsel of Hitler,and, therefore, he was particularly close to him. Before 1933 even, hehad been the leader and propagandist of National Socialist legal ideas.If one bears that in mind, then one sees already on the one hand, theMinistry with its expert officials, the official activities; on theother hand, the combination of National Socialist ideas on law with theaim of overrunning the Ministry. Frank recognized Guertners qualities;therefore, he tried by the tactics of continuously wearing him down, toachieve his aim. If one knows National Socialist methods, one knows howstubborn and tenacious such a battle was in the methods with which itwas waged, and that struggle had reached its climax when Guertner died,and I took over the conduct of affairs.Q. What was the situation at that time?A. One gets a true idea of that situation if one forms a picturein ones mind of those three groups or parties which were fightingagainst the administration of justice with the aim of conquering theadministration of justice in order to destroy it. I call these fightinggroups by the names of their leaders, Himmler, Bormann, Goebbels; and,in so doing I would like to emphasize that during the whole time I onlytalked once to each of those three men.Himmler proceeded by different roads; the undermining of confidencein the legal administration of justice and the conquering of itscompetence. Attacks were being made continuously on the administrationof justice in the periodical of the SS which had already been mentionedin this trial, _Das Schwarze Korps_ [The Black Corps]. They werenot content with criticizing sentences, but proceeded to defame inpublic the judges who had passed the sentences. Himmler collectedmaterial by sending secret observers to the court sessions. Theofficials of the Ministry were watched and spied upon. Anonymous secretreports, in which the Ministry was attacked, were sent out. Persons whohad been acquitted by court sentences were taken into police custody.Others, who had been sentenced to a term in prison, were seized by thepolice, and as the administration of justice heard later, many of thosepersons were killed by shooting. All these things were intended anddesigned to undermine the confidence in the administration of justice.The administration of justice was to be discredited in public again andagain as a backward and outmoded institution both as regards personneland the subject matter. Himmler proceeded, I should like to say,with cynical frankness, on the basis of this propaganda. He deprivedthe Ministry of Justice of many fields of competence, and claimedfor himself even many more fields of competence from the Ministry ofJustice. He invoked the power of his position under Hitler and demandedthat the competence for penal cases concerning Poles and Jews shouldbe transferred to the police. His attempts to conquer the publicprosecutors offices for the police continued until the end. It isobvious that that aim, which was placed higher and higher, by necessitywould lead to the thought of whether one would not have to show that bynew and more stringent measures one was in a position to overcome thecriticism which Himmler used as a pretense, and thereby take the windout of his sails.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *Q. What part did Bormann play in that struggle against theadministration of justice?A. Bormanns work extended, above all, to personnel policy. Underthe existing provisions, no ministry could appoint an official orpromote him against the opposition of the Party Chancellery. The ReichMinistry of Justice always made its selection entirely on the basisof professional qualifications. Bormann, on the other hand, attachedimportance exclusively to the political opinion and the merits forthe Party. If he objected to a suggestion made by the Ministry ofJustice, and it was not possible to overcome the opposition, there wasnothing else to be done at first, but to wait for a better situationperhaps, and leave the position unfilled. I experienced it myself thatthe position of a president of a district court of appeal remainedvacant for that reason for more than a year. But it is obvious that thepossibilities of such action had a certain limit. It was inadvisableto leave an unlimited number of positions vacant. And sometimes onewas forced to appoint to the administration of justice personnel ofonly moderate qualifications, whereas persons who were better qualifiedwere left out. Bormann knew very well how to promote Hitlers antipathyfor the administration of justice on the one hand, and on the otherhand how to exploit the naturally weak and unpolitical position ofthe Ministry under Hitler. Hitler continuously received newspaperclippings about court proceedings and sentences. Usually, the factswere distorted, or the reports, in any case, were always inadequate.Hitler was always approached on these subjects only at a moment whenfor some other reason he was disgruntled and his attention had to bedistracted. Those reasons very often resulted from the war situation.For Bormann, the administration of justice was the lightning conductor.The Gauleiters cooperated with him. They collected the material withgreat glee by getting newspaper clippings from provincial newspapers.The Gauleiter of Munich [Gau Munich-Upper Bavaria], Wagner, excelled.Every opportunity was used to discredit the administration of justicebefore Hitler with entirely inadequate documentation. The key to thatsituation lies in a statement which Goering made to me at the time theadministration of justice became centralized.[162] I will revert tothat later. Therefore, our main endeavor had to be to inform Hitler atthe earliest possible moment, and, of course, completely and honestly.I shall have an opportunity to explain how those attempts wereconstantly sabotaged by Bormann.I should like to say now that our attempt was to prevent Hitler fromchanging sentences after they had been passed by suggesting that thepresidents of the district court of appeal should confirm the sentenceswhereby merely a technical, nonpolitical review would have been carriedout. That attempt was intentionally brought to naught by Bormann forhe realized that thereby it would have been impossible for Hitler toreopen, on the initiative of Party, trials which had been concluded.Q. The possibility which the witness mentioned concerning thepossibility of Bormanns interference with every appointment of anofficial results from the decree of 10 July 1937 published in theReichsgesetzblatt of 1937, page 769.[163] I shall submit that decree ina supplement to my document book.Witness, concerning the evidence submitted by the prosecution, couldyou discuss a case which reveals such efforts being made by the Party?A. I am able to do that. I refer to the statements made by theprosecution witness Ferber. He dealt with a case about which Guertnerhad frequently talked to me. That was the case against Heller in whichthe law against motor car traps [Gesetz ueber die Autofallen-Stellung]had been applied. For the information of the Tribunal I may say thatlaw was promulgated on 22 June 1938. It is based on the particularinitiative of Hitler.The facts of the case were as follows: Soon after that law had beenpromulgated, Heller and his mistress as the riders of a drivingschool [sic][164] had attacked a driver and had robbed his money.While the case was being tried before the Special Court in Nuernbergin the presence of Gauleiter Streicher, and Denzler, the Gau legaloffice leader, Hitler appeared in Nuernberg unexpectedly. A deathsentence against Heller was expected for certain. Evidently Streicherand Denzler intended to submit to Hitler in his presence a proposalfor a death sentence on the basis of this new law in which Hitlerwas particularly interested. A telephone call was put through to theMinistry of Justice to hear an opinion on the question of clemency.Opposition was encountered there on the part of the Referent. ThatReferent was Ministerialrat Westphal, who was indicted here.[165] Herefused to give his opinion because the legal problem which had arisenin the Heller case was being dealt with in a case before the ReichSupreme Court which was still pending and was there to be submittedfor the opinion of the Reich Supreme Court judges. At that point theParty representatives became busy. Denzler reported this information toHitler implying that Guertner obviously was sabotaging the applicationof this law, which Hitler himself had promoted, and he boasted thatthat was enough to bring about Guertners fall. At any rate, thatinterference on the part of the Party led to the fact that Hitler,following Denzlers report, ordered the death sentence to be executedwithout waiting for the Ministry of Justice to give its opinion.In Berlin, Hitler took to account the Referent Westphal in great angerfor sabotaging the law, and only because Guertner acted on behalf ofhis own staff and only with the greatest effort was it possible to saveWestphal.Q. The Heller case which has just been mentioned begins in thetranscript, page 1324, English text.[166]What part did Goebbels play in that struggle against the administrationof justice?A. Goebbels set the machinery of propaganda to work against theadministration of justice. He deluded the public by telling them thatthe people no longer had any confidence in the judiciary. That was adelusion for the opposite was true.His propaganda machine not only made direct or camouflaged attacksagainst the judiciary in public and tried to lower their prestige,but he also tried by his art of dialectics in his speeches on theadministration of justice quite deliberately to lead the judges astrayand to put their consciences as judges to sleep. He coined the conceptof the exigency of the State, and said that the courts, too, ought tomake that their starting point. For a sentence, first of all expediencewas decisive, and only later, perhaps, justice might also be considered.Q. Goebbels speech before the members of the Peoples Court iscontained in Document NG-417, Prosecution Exhibit 23.[167]What were the opportunities at the disposal of those power groups andwhich they made use of in their struggle against the administration ofjustice?A. Himmler, Bormann, and Goebbels were the closest confidants ofHitler. They had access to him at any time. For him they representedthe uncompromising incarnation of national socialism. He listened tothem when they alleged national socialism was being endangered by theadministration of justice. The entire apparatus of Party politics,police, and espionage was at their disposal. On the other hand,the Ministry of Justice was entirely isolated. Contact between theministries, which would have strengthened its position, no longerexisted.Q. Here I would like to refer to the verdict of the IMT, Englishtranscript, page 16963[168], and I would like to quote that passagebriefly: As to the first reason for our decision, it is to be observedthat from the time that it can be said that a conspiracy to makeaggressive war existed the Reich cabinet did not constitute a governingbody, but was merely an aggregation of administrative officers subjectto the absolute control of Hitler.Witness, will you continue, please?A. In view of that situation, what could a Ministry of Justice do whichwas directed merely by an Under-Secretary as acting Minister who,furthermore, was not a member of the Party and whose words, naturally,did not get the same hearing as those of a Minister; a man who, as theindictment said, never attained cabinet rank? According to an expressinstruction by Hitler, the chief only was told those things which werenecessary for him to fulfill his own task. It is evident that thatinstruction made possible all kinds of limitations. * * *                               (Recess)Q. Witness, before the recess we discussed the possibilities at thedisposal of these power groups. Please, will you continue.A. I ventured to point out that Hitler had given an explicit orderthat a chief of any office should only be instructed about that whichhe had to know in order to carry out his tasks. And that went veryfar. That situation is better explained by the fact that MinisterGuertner, for instance, only found out about the euthanasia decree[169]when in reports on the situation rendered by the presidents of thedistrict courts of appeal, a certain suspicion arose that this decreewas carried out, and Guertner categorically demanded an elucidation.Whereas other ministers were authorized to listen to foreignbroadcasts, that was prohibited to the Minister of Justice under threatof punishment. When I objected against this, I was told in reply that Ishould turn to the Ministry of Propaganda which would inform me abouteverything that happened.I may point out that the opinion of the International Military Tribunalstates that on account of the control over broadcasting and the press,and the propaganda machine, an independent judgment based on freedom ofthought became an absolute impossibility. I, from my own experience,can only confirm that statement. A significant example is given by thefollowing occurrence--an example showing the extent of that spy system.The Gauleiter of East Prussia had protested against the administrationof justice in his district. In order to examine these complaints in1940 or 1941--I do not know the date precisely any more--I traveledto Koenigsberg and found out that as for the reports by the presidentof the district court of appeal, the Gauleiter was informed aboutthese reports sooner than I was. Based on warnings received fromreliable sources, I had to expect that in the various offices ofthe municipality which I had to visit, special microphones had beeninstalled for the occasion of my visit, and I could only talk withmy personal Referent by driving out to the beach and picking out anisolated beach chair there in order to be able to talk to him withoutanybody listening to us and spying on us.Q. The passage in the opinion of the International Military Tribunal,to which the witness referred, is contained in the English transcripton page 16,813.[170] Witness, the prosecution charges you with the factthat the Ministry of Justice was in an official contact with theseoffices which you have just mentioned. What can you say about this?A. I believe that that contact is inherent in the structure of theState: the distribution of tasks to the various agencies. A cooperationwith the police was certainly to a certain extent unavoidable.According to German law of criminal procedure, the prosecution is notin a position at all, without the cooperation of the police, to carryout the required investigations pending trial. If a denouncement hasbeen received by the prosecution, the prosecution has to conduct thenecessary investigation first of all. That the prosecution should doall that itself, considering the large number of things to be done,is quite impossible. The prosecution, therefore, has to turn to thelocal police and, for good reasons, in the German Judicature Act andthe German Code for Penal Procedure, the police are designated as anauxiliary organ for the prosecution and directed to cooperate uponrequest of the prosecution.Apart from the police, frequently the SD is mentioned in the trial. Onthe part of Hitler, the SD apart from its function within the Partyhad received important tasks, such as the delivery of information tovarious Reich agencies, and therefore even the court authorities had torefer to that source of information.Q. In this connection, may I refer to Document NG-219, ProsecutionExhibit 42.[171] Please continue.A. The position of the Party Chancellery, was regulated legally ina way that changes of personnel, that is to say, promotions andappointments could only take place with the cooperation on the part ofthe Party Chancellery. That I have already pointed out. Added to thiswas the fact that in 1942, the Chief of the Party Chancellery was giventhe position of a Reich Minister participating in legislation. It wastherefore necessary to let him participate in the preparation of everylaw.Q. The decree of 16 January 1942, to which reference was just made,I shall submit as Schlegelberger Document 23, Schlegelberger Exhibit63.[172]A. And then finally the Ministry of Propaganda. The fact that thisMinistry was directed by Goebbels may cause, to a non-Germans mind,the misconception that this was a Party function. That, as I said,would be a misconception because the Ministry of Propaganda was not aParty office but a Ministry, just as the Ministry of Justice or theMinistry of Finance, or the Foreign Office, and that there was anofficial channel between all the ministries is a matter of course inevery state. But that connection was also a necessity from the point ofview of [self] defense. Only thus was it possible, at least from timeto time, to guard oneself against surprises. Only thus was it possible,perhaps in the very last moment, to make successful objections.Q. The witness referred to a provision of the Code of Penal Procedureaccording to which the prosecution could authorize the police to makeinvestigations. That is article 161 of the Code of Penal Procedure.Furthermore, in this connection, article 146 of the Judicature Act hasto be considered. About the importance of reports and information fromthe SD, I shall submit as Schlegelberger Document 92, SchlegelbergerExhibit 85, a report from the handbook for allied troops.Witness, in your own camp, that is to say in the field of theadministration of justice itself, did you have to fight againstopposition?A. That question, unfortunately, I have to confirm emphatically.First of all, and very briefly, I again have to mention Frank inthis connection, the representative of the National Socialist legalideology, who through all available channels succeeded in bringing thisthought before the public. As means, he had at his disposal, first thelegal publications under his influence, the National Socialist LegalWorkers League whose president he was, and the Academy of German Lawwhich he had created. That academy which possibly, in view of itscomposition, could be considered a sort of scientific institute to aidthe administration of justice, evolved by Frank as a competition inorder to direct the Ministry of Justice, to overrule and to discreditit with the Party. As soon as he found out, from his own informationsources, that the Ministry of Justice intended to carry out reforms,he mobilized his academy immediately which on its part was to prepareplans and to publish them, and not much emphasis was placed upon theirquality. But the main purpose was to demonstrate that Frank was theleader of the living young justice in opposition to the old senilemachinery of justice of the State. Apart from that goal to carry outhis famous thesis, Right is that which serves the German people, healso for personal ambitions and, last but not least, for that ambition,had intentions to take over the post of Ministry of Justice.Q. Could you name other personalities who in that manner fought againstthe administration of justice?A. From the inside, unfortunately, yes. I have not completed mystatement. I am thinking of Thierack. Thierack had very closeconnections to Bormann. He concentrated his efforts at first on thePresident of the Peoples Court, a position he held at the time. Behindthe back of the Ministry of Justice in 1936, he arranged that Hitlermake a speech before the Peoples Court. As these proceedings haveshown, in 1937 he had attempted to arrange another speech of that kind.Q. The witness refers here to Document NG-209, Prosecution Exhibit105.[173]A. The judges of the Peoples Court in this manner should be broughtto understand that the Peoples Court was an institution of a specialnature, in closest connection to Hitler himself; and that it was onlyby a mistaken step that the Peoples Court had been incorporated intothe administrative structure of the Ministry of Justice; and concerningthat administrative connection in 1938, again in all secrecy, he triedthrough the Chief of the Reich Chancellery, to have the presidencyof the Peoples Court, following the Italian example, subordinatedimmediately to Hitler. To my knowledge, Thierack, after he becameMinister,[174] did not continue with these attempts. As I was informedfrom various sources, in his attempts to become Minister, he is allegedto have promised to the Party that the office of the prosecution shouldbe turned over to the police. I shall later refer to the occurrencesduring the trial of the Czech Minister-President Elias; but in the endI still have to emphasize what extraordinary difficulties were made forme by the personality of Freisler.Q. Who was Freisler?A. Well, the witness Behl once characterized Freisler as therepresentative of the Party interests in the Ministry of Justice. Thatwas correct. His career was the following: Freisler was a prisoner ofwar in Russia during the First World War. After the end of the warhe remained in Russia for a considerable period of time. About hisactivities during that period of time in Russia, a veil has neverbeen completely lifted. After he returned, he became an attorney atKassel, mainly acting as defense counsel for National Socialists. Whenthe Prussian Ministry of Justice was put in the hands of MinisterKerrl, the latter called the old Party member, Freisler, to the postof Under Secretary. He remained there until in 1934, on the occasionof the merger of both offices in 1934, he was transferred to theReich Ministry of Justice. Freisler no doubt possessed a high degreeof intelligence, but quite apparently he was of abnormal spiritualinclinations that ranged from extreme brutality all the way to a ratherfeminine weakness. After he had insulted his assistants in the worstpossible manner without any reason, it would occur that soon after hecame to them to ask for their forgiveness in a very servile manner.The Tribunal has actually made the acquaintance of Freisler opticallyand acoustically.[175] He was quite well informed about problems ofcriminal law, but he lacked any continuity and seriousness in his work.He was restless and imbued with a lust for power, always looking fornew tasks and new problems. He was an old Party member, and he had theGolden Party Badge, but he represented that type of National Socialistwho again and again fearfully vied for the favor of Hitler. Hitlerdefinitely recognized him as a one hundred percent National Socialist,but personally did not think as much of him as Freisler would haveliked. Therefrom, and from his task to supervise the Ministry fromthe National Socialist point of view, and from his indisputableintelligence and his expert knowledge in the field of criminal law, thedangerous qualities in his personality could be seen. He knew wherehe had to start in order to achieve his goals. To work with him wasextremely difficult, and I may well say here that Freisler was the one,after all, who undermined the work and the strength of Guertner andcontributed to his early death. And so, as far as I was concerned, mycontinuous attempts to restrict Freisler made it extremely difficultfor me in my position. He did not stick to decisions which we hadmade in long debates. He made secret promises to the [Nazi] Partywhich, after they became apparent, restricted the Minister in hispossibilities of action.Again and again I discovered that, partly intentionally, partly out ofneglect, he had failed to report to me on important occurrences. He hadprohibited his ministerial directors from reporting to me directly. Hewanted to do everything alone. In addition, although he did not drinkmuch, he could not restrain himself once he started to drink, and ina condition of that kind he frequently made statements which gave anentirely wrong picture of the intentions of the Minister. Then when thedisappointment came, when the agencies concerned found out that thepractice of the Ministry was not according to these statements, then,of course, there were serious accusations on the part of the Party anda renewed struggle.His unstable nature brought it about that when I made objections tohim he, frequently in tears, promised to better himself; but his moralstrength was not sufficient to make him keep these promises for anylength of time.Of course, my position with regard to Freisler was weaker than thatof Guertner. I was, indeed, in charge of the work of the Ministry,but only due to the fact that I was the senior Under Secretary;otherwise we were on the same level. The possibility of influencinghim or influencing others against him, was very limited for me,all the more because my mission was not set for a certain time,but could be repealed any day. Therefore, I could only find theoptimal accomplishment of my tasks in maintaining the status quo inthe Ministry of Justice as it was at the time of Guertners death;especially if one takes into consideration as a matter of course thaton the one hand the attacks from the Party became stronger, being facedwith a weaker man in charge of the Ministry, and that on the otherhand this weaker man was always confronted with the necessity of anincreased resistance on his part.In these proceedings here the witness, Father Wein,[176] confirmedthat during the time when I was in charge of conducting the affairs,the administration of justice had not deteriorated and that only theappointment of Thierack brought about an absolute change-over. I askyou to try to understand that in that I found a justification for thework of my life under these conditions as I have described them.Q. What did the taking over of the post of Minister by Thierack mean toyou?A. I believe I should continue at the point where the speech made bythe prosecution left off. The prosecution said, Schlegelberger hadseen the storm brewing. That is quite correct. I anticipated a storm,and I tried to prevent it. The attitude of Thierack up to that timeand his close relations with Bormann did not leave any doubt as to hisprogram, and just as I interpreted that, it came about. As soon asThierack assumed office, a complete change-over occurred. It was not agradual deterioration, but it was that famous construction of a strongNational Socialist administration of justice as it had been ordered byHitler. I merely point to the changes in the administration of justiceand in legislation which are contained in material submitted by theprosecution. If one sees what had been demanded for a long time andwhich by all means was tried to achieve, if one sees how that all of asudden now came into effect, I believe then only one can find the rightmeasure for that which I, in a continuous struggle, had prevented orhad delayed. I do not want to omit but to describe briefly the completechange in personnel policy. With the exception of the man in chargeof the budget department, all ministerial directors were released byThierack and many Referenten transferred. The entire top level of theMinistry had changed overnight. Furthermore, twenty-two presidents ofdistrict courts of appeal, eleven of them the best ones on the basis oftheir qualifications, and four general prosecutors were retired.If in the dire situation of war such a unique measure is taken, onedemonstrates most clearly that my dismissal and the appointment ofThierack, in the feeling of Hitler and Thierack, represent the point atwhich an entire new development starts. The purge measures by Thierackwere extended also to the many non-Aryan judges or judges with Jewishrelatives who at that time were still in service and to many officialswho did not just belong to the Party.I believe that my decision to fight until the very limit, and tostay that long in the Ministry, has found its justification. Clearlyanticipating that with that new man [Thierack] chaos would start forthe administration of justice, there was only one thing left to me;although the burden physically and psychologically was at times almostimpossible to bear, to try and bear it, and to fight as resiliently aspossible. Of course, it was clear to me, and I had to experience thefact too, that I would be beaten at times, and had to decide to makedetours wherever I could take that upon my conscience.Q. In your opinion, what was that extreme limit which could still bejustified--of those which you have just mentioned?A. If the Tribunal was good enough to follow me in the description ofmy life, then it will easily recognize what my work at that time meantto a man whose life was devoted to the law. At times, today, it ishard even for me to transfer myself back again into those days and tobring those days back. In a system which was worked out to the verylast detail of expediency and power, there was a lonely island amidstthe continuous storm in those days--that was the administration ofjustice. I had to experience how the storm hit again and again, and howcertain sacrifices had to be made to this storm of power in order toprevent it from triumphing completely. For me, in that situation, therewas only one consideration--can a measure be made compatible with theuncompromising principles of law such as I had considered them so faras a matter of course? Was not everything now only a question of power?How could I avoid that lust for power and prevent the accomplishmentof these designs? What will go through regardless of my cooperationand what can I prevent without cooperation? And that deliberation ledme to find that extreme limit which I have mentioned before. It wasfor me the final abolition of the independence of the courts. I hadto try to maintain this independence at all costs. In spite of andin the face of the devilish propaganda on the part of Goebbels, Iwas of the firm conviction that the German courts and German judgeswere still in good shape. Although, now, from the large number ofthe many sentences, particularly of the more recent period, theprosecution may select a few in order to prove that legal principleswere abandoned in the sentences. To deal with individual cases is notmy task in these proceedings. A full examination of the entire fieldof the administration of justice would show that this conviction ofmine was very well founded, and that the maintenance of the integrityof the German courts was a goal which was well worth my work and mytrouble; because I was, and still am, of the opinion that the work ofthe courts is the most secure guaranty for the law. Therefore, I triedagain and again to draw various fields within the scope of work of thecourts. For instance, in the economic field, the problem of gettingagriculture [farms] out of debt [Landwirtschaftliche Entschuldung], thequestion of hereditary and marriage health, but the basic prerequisitewas that the courts had to remain independent. When, in 1937, in theGerman Civil Service Law, Hitler was given the right to retire anycivil servant if this civil servant could not be expected at any timeto fight for the National Socialist State, in my capacity as chief ofthe Department for Public Law at the Ministry, I had a security clauseinserted for the judges; this clause provided that measures regardingthe judicial civil servant could not be based on the objective contentsof a judges decision. Once the independence of the courts was lost,the protection of the courts was lost, too. The activity of the courtscould even become a danger. Therefore, I drew for myself this extremelimit for my stay in office. With the resolution of the Reichstag of26 April 1942,[177] my struggle reached its final stage. It was notquite clear, as it appeared frequently with Hitlers speeches whetheror not his speech had attacked the administration of justice merely fortactical reasons, and whether the true objects were general ones.[178]Dr. Lammers, the Chief of the Reich Chancellery, to whom I spokeimmediately after the speech about all these matters, confirmed thatbackground to me as being the true objective of Hitlers polemics. Ihad to create clarity. I wrote to Hitler a report [Fuehrerinformation]to the effect that the judges were extremely disturbed by that speech.I had explained to the judges that with all the weight of my office,I would protect every judge who acted according to his conscience andto the law. That clarified the situation as far as I was concerned.If Hitlers speech really meant the beginning of the end of theindependence of the courts, then he had to consider my statement as anopen declaration of war. That was what I wanted, and I wanted to bringabout a breach, in that case, on purpose.Q. How did your dismissal come about?A. Hitler at first did not answer that letter which I just mentioned.There was a lot of talk behind the scenes about a new appointmentfor the post of Minister. A few weeks later, Lammers, Chief of theReich Chancellery, called me to him and told me that Hitler had madeup his mind to appoint a new Minister of Justice, and he asked mewhat my attitude would be if the choice fell on Thierack. I repliedthat to work with Thierack was quite out of the question. Literally,I added, I would not sit at the same table with Thierack. Lammersreplied, that was what he had thought, and for that eventuality hewas instructed by Hitler to offer me another office comparable to theposition I was holding. He had thought it over and was now prepared tooffer me the position of President of the Reich Supreme AdministrativeCourt. I rejected that offer and asked Lammers to inform Hitler thatI would accept a new office under no circumstances, but wanted tobe retired. Soon after, Lammers wrote me that I should come to hisquarters at Zhitomir and receive the document concerning my retirementfrom office and thereafter, to report to Hitler at his headquarters atVinnitsa in order to take my leave. That order I carried out. On thatoccasion, Lammers, on order from Hitler, gave me a check for 100,000marks, which should make it easier for me to bridge the transition intoretirement.I was not happy about that donation; on the contrary, I was greatlydisturbed. I got in touch with the Chief of the PresidentialChancellery, Dr. Meissner, and asked how I could avoid accepting thatamount. Meissner replied that refusal was impossible, because it wouldmean an unfriendly act toward Hitler, and all the bad consequenceswould have to be accepted. Thereupon, I did not return the check andwhen the Russians came, that amount was still untouched in the bank.At Vinnitsa, Hitler received me. The conversation lasted about 20minutes. Hitler told me approximately the following: He required hisofficials to carry out his instructions without criticism of any kind.He added, Since you have already criticized my measures, I believeit is better if we separate. He was referring to the report whichI have already mentioned. I took advantage of that opportunity totell Hitler with all the frankness at my disposal that an intact andindependent administration of justice was a vital question for Germany;that his method to form his judgment on the basis of informationreceived from Gauleiters, and his intention to retire judges who haddone their duty, was an impossibility. The very concept of a judgerequired independence. People would never respect the judgment of adependent judge as an expression of law. I added that if I had remainedin office, I would have continued to protect anybody who was prosecutedunjustly.Hitler took these statements on the whole quite calmly. Time and timeagain he even nodded approval; but when I touched upon the question ofthe independence of judges in connection with his Reichstag speech hesuddenly harangued against the generals and got into a hot fury whichslowly ebbed like a dying flame.Q. The prosecution alleges that there was a conspiratorial cooperationbetween you and your codefendants. Will you briefly describe yourrelations with the codefendants?A. As for these relations I have, in part, to answer absolutely in thenegative. A number of my codefendants I have only met here. Not witha single one of the defendants here did I have any personal contactbeyond official connections. These official contacts in most casesconsisted of just occasional conferences required by the work.As the defendants dock shows, the prosecution has selected a mere fewfrom the large number of officials of the administration of justice.All of them, together with other colleagues, worked only in that fieldto which they were assigned. If one would follow the principle ofconspiracy as expounded by the prosecution, the entire administrationof justice since 1933 would have to be considered one organizationin the meaning of the count of the indictment. And I believe that anopinion of that nature would best be rebutted by the fact that when Ileft the Ministry of Justice, that great change took place. That issufficient rebuttal for the assertion of personal homogeneity of theofficials and the judges.Q. We want to depart now from personal matters and discuss thecomplaints made against you. The objective charges made against youbegin with the centralization [Verreichlichung] of the administrationof justice. Will you give us your general point of view concerning thatquestion?A. When the empire was founded in 1871, certain agencies of theReich were founded as an over-all authority beyond the limits of theindividual federal state. The same occurred in the field of justice.At that time, it was called the Reich Justice Office [Reichjustizamt]and, in fact, was a Reich Ministry. Later, it got that name. The ReichJustice Office had almost exclusively legislative functions. It had todeal with regulations for the administration of justice.Once such a regulation had been passed, all states had to issueexecutive laws for the execution of the respective regulation. Thatmeant that after each major Reich law had been passed, more than 20laws had to be passed in the various states to carry out the principlesof the Reich law.What that machinery meant can be seen if one looks at the collectionof these executive laws of various states. With great surprise youfind that this fills two fat volumes. As for administrative tasks, theReich Justice Office, as already mentioned, only had to take care ofthe Reich Supreme Court, and in the course of time, the Reich PatentOffice. Here, also, the various states [Laender] had to cooperate. Theselection of judges for the Reich Supreme Court required most difficultnegotiations. One has to have seen that, in order to realize fully withwhat jealousy each individual state saw to it that these various postswere filled according to a definite key.It could happen that a small state could not even offer an appropriatecandidate for such a position at the Reich Supreme Court, but then onehad to preserve the claim and register it very carefully so that thenext time, they could be given it. It was just as difficult to selectofficials for the Ministry of Justice. That, too, required negotiationsand thus it came about that, long before 1933, everywhere, the desirefor a uniform administration of justice for the entire Reich wasexpressed. I may remind you that the witness Behl[179] has stated thateven the Social Democratic Party of Germany was expressly of that sameopinion.Q. Witness, you referred to the assumption of the administration ofjustice by the Reich.A. Before the recess I pointed out that the desire for a uniform,centralized administration of justice had already existed in the periodprior to 1933. The Reich Minister of Justice, Guertner, worked for thatidea of the centralization of the administration of justice with greatenergy. The fact that he as a Bavarian did so, although it is generallyknown how very much Bavaria was interested in a life of its own,explains best the fact that Guertner had very good reasons for doingso. As often occurs in life, by accident a circumstance arose whichspeeded up the execution of that idea. This is what happened:Once when I had a conversation with Kerrl, the Minister of Justiceof Prussia at that time, and visited with him the training camp forPrussian law students--a camp which has been repeatedly referred to inthis trial--I said to him that it must have cost a great deal of moneyto set up that camp; Kerrl laughed and replied, quite frankly:   Oh, it didnt cost me anything. The amounts were donated by   large firms, in whose cases we were very considerate about   prosecuting them under penal law. Naturally, the money was not   transferred to me directly, but it came to me via the Winter   Relief [Winterhilfe] account. However, the Winter Relief   Organization made it available to me, and with that money we   built up a very decent camp, as you can see for yourself.I was more than disgusted when I heard about those practices he thusunveiled. I made a report to Guertner.The right of supervision over the Ministries of Justice of the Laender,was not in the hands of the Reich Minister of Justice. Guertner and Iagreed that those practices must be stopped at the earliest possiblemoment, all the more so since one did not know whether or not inother Laender, similar things might be happening as were happening inPrussia. One could not tell what was happening because the ministriesof the Laender throughout had new men working with them concerningwhose persons, in some cases, one had certain misgivings, and justifiedmisgivings. Frank was the Minister of Justice for Bavaria, and Thierackwas the Minister of Justice for Saxony.That experience increased Guertners energy in carrying out his work ofcentralization. The basis for that work was laid down in the first andsecond centralization laws dated 16 February and 5 December 1934.[180]The result of the centralization, the transfer of the tasks of theMinistries of Justice of the Laender to the Reich, was this, from thepolitical angle: The entire administration of justice from now on layin the hands of a minister who was not a member of the Party and who,as Minister of Justice for Bavaria, had enjoyed the confidence of allparties from the extreme right to the extreme left. I myself, whoalso was not a member of the Party, remained at my post. The NationalSocialist Ministers of Justice of the Laender lost their officialpositions in the administration of justice.The opinions of the Party as to the centralization of theadministration of justice is evidenced best by a statement ofGoerings, which he made to me in 1941 when, in the course of aconversation, I said to him that the Party at every opportunity madedifficulties for our ministry, he said to me: That cannot surpriseyou. The reason lies in the centralization of the administration ofjustice under the circumstances under which it was achieved. That isthe reason why the Party as a group is opposed to the Reich Ministry ofJustice and makes life as difficult as possible for that ministry. TheParty is of the opinion that the administration of justice should againbe taken over by National Socialist hands. Goering added, I myselfwill never pardon Guertner and you for the way you acted in 1934.Q. I shall submit Schlegelberger Document 26, Schlegelberger Exhibit66,[181] in reference to the aforesaid statements. Will you please giveus a brief description of the organization of the Reich Ministry ofJustice?A. Under the very top, that is, under the Reich Minister of Justice,there were two separate under secretariats: the under secretariat forcivil law matters, the head of which was myself; the direction of thesecretariat for penal law matters which was in the hands of Freisler.Further, he was in charge of the so-called organization section[Organisationreferat], the Hereditary Farm Law [Erbhofrecht] and theInspection Office for Judicial Affairs [Justizpruefungsamt].Under the two under secretariats there worked a total of sixministerial directors each of whom was the head of his specializeddivisions. The number of these divisions and their sphere of workchanged several times in the course of time.Inside some departments, subsections had been created which were incharge of a Ministerialdirigent. The number of higher officials[182] inthe Reich Ministry of Justice amounted to approximately 250. Personnelmatters were divided into regions. As regards the East, I was only incharge of my own home province, East Prussia. Otherwise, I dealt withwestern and southern Germany, Freisler was in charge of the remaining[regions]. Freisler was in charge of the Peoples Court. The ReichSupreme Court and the Reich patent office were in my charge. The twodivisions, directed by Under Secretaries were entirely separate fromone another. Freisler and myself had different times at which we wentto report to the Minister. The Minister asked me to come to see himwhen Freisler had finished his report and had left the room. Only veryrarely, and only when one of my officials was to be appointed to a headoffice in Freislers sphere, or vice versa, did the two of us meet atthe Ministers. If one of the under secretaries was absent, his affairswere dealt with by the Minister together with the competent ministerialdirector. The other under secretary did not deputize for the one whowas absent.May I cite an example? In 1938 I had to go to the hospital as a resultof an accident, and at that time the Minister did not discuss the newGerman marriage law with Freisler, but with the head of the respectivedepartment. If the Minister were also absent, the Under Secretary,who was present in Berlin, did only a certain amount of duty for hiscolleague. That is to say, he was available for matters which couldnot possibly be postponed. In my recollection, that happened onlyvery rarely, for this was one point over which Freisler and I were inabsolute agreement. Neither had the wish to meddle with the othersaffairs.Furthermore, Freisler when he went on a business trip or when he wentaway for the summer holidays was practically always in contact withBerlin. Therefore, he told Dr. Guertner that a deputy for which I wasthe only possible candidate was neither necessary nor desirable. It didhappen that when the Minister did not feel well and left the officeearlier, he asked me by telephone to sign and to dispatch letters whichhe had already signed in draft form. Now and then that could haveconcerned matters which fell into Freislers sphere when Freisler couldnot be reached.I should like to cite as example the letter which the prosecutionsubmitted about the fight against political Catholicism. Concerningdetails accompanying that letter, I know nothing about this. Inparticular, I do not know what particular pressure was exercised orwhat instructions Hitler had issued in virtue of his right to lay downthe directives of policy but I should like on this occasion to saysomething about what was the practice of the Ministry in regard tochurch affairs. I should like to point out what the witness for theprosecution, the Catholic Priest, Schosser, testified here on 9 May.According to his testimony, the Ministry refused on the occasion of achurch funeral for Poles to take steps against the Catholic clergymen.DR. KUBUSCHOK: The letter which you have mentioned isDocument NG-630, Prosecution Exhibit 428.[183] The examination whichyou mentioned here of Father Schosser is on page 3021 in the Englishtranscript.[184]       *       *       *       *       *       *       *          V. EVIDENCE CONCERNING PRINCIPAL ISSUES IN THE CASE                            A. IntroductionThis major section of the volume contains selections from the evidenceconcerning leading questions or issues of the trial. The evidenceselected for publication herein constitutes only about one-twentiethof the total mimeographed record. Hence, all issues of the trial arenot covered, and numerous items of evidence mentioned in the printedmaterials are not reproduced herein. Where extracts from testimonyhave been reproduced, a footnote indicates the pages of the officialmimeographed transcript where the entire testimony can be found.Both prosecution and defense evidence is contained in each of thesections into which the evidence selected has been organized. Theprosecution evidence consists in the main of contemporaneous documentsof the Nazi era, most of them discovered in German archives by Alliedinvestigators after Germanys unconditional surrender. The defenseevidence consists principally of extracts from the testimony ofdefendants. A substantial number of the contemporaneous documentsoffered by the defense have also been selected for publication.With one or two exceptions, the contemporaneous documents have beenreproduced within the various sections in chronological order,regardless of whether they were offered by the prosecution or thedefense. In selecting defense testimony under the various topicalsections, considerable emphasis has been given to the testimony ofthe three defendants Schlegelberger, Rothenberger, and Klemm who wereappointed Under Secretaries in the Reich Ministry of Justice, andto the testimony of the defendant Rothaug, presiding judge of theNuernberg Special Court.The defendants were charged with participation in various types ofcriminal conduct by distortion and denial of judicial and penalprocess. The selections from the evidence below have been grouped intofive main sections (sec. VB through VF) treating of various types ofconduct by which it was alleged that the defendants engaged in criminalacts as principals or accessories.In Hitlers Third Reich many persons were placed entirely outsidethe judicial process. Therefore the first section (B) is concernedwith measures under which persons were committed to the protectivecustody of the police (usually the Gestapo) or to the concentrationcamps of Himmlers SS.The next four sections (C through F) deal with various methods wherebyit was charged that perversions of law and the judicial process wereemployed to persecute, imprison, and execute or exterminate largenumbers of persons. Section C, which contains evidence on numeroustopics, has been divided into three periods of time: 1933--January1941 when Guertner was Reich Minister of Justice; January 1941--August1942, when the defendant Schlegelberger was acting Reich Ministerof Justice; and August 1942--1945, when Thierack was Reich Ministerof Justice. The next section (D) deals with large groups of personsallegedly subjected to discriminatory treatment of many kinds: Germans,Poles, Jews of several nationalities, the Night and Fog prisoners fromoccupied western Europe, and others. Section E deals with the growth,development, and application of such concepts as treason, underminingthe defensive strength, and public enemies. These concepts were appliedin cases against persons who were not nationals of Germany as wellas against Germans. The final section (F) deals with the handling ofreligious matters.Because of the close relationship of the developments of these varioustopics to the crowded history of the Nazi regime, there necessarilyis considerable over-lap between the several sections into which theevidence has been organized. A case where a Pole was convicted oftreason against Germany (reproduced here in sec. E) cannot be divorcedfrom the materials concerning the general treatment of Poles (includedin sec. D2). The Night and Fog prisoners offer another example, sincethese prisoners were ordinarily kept incommunicado in concentrationcamps, and the evidence concerning them (D3) is closely related tothe evidence dealing with protective custody and concentration camps(B). The over-lap is often quite pronounced in the extracts from thetestimony of defendants. Most of the defendants were active in a numberof different fields and held different official positions during the12 years of the Nazi era. In making out his case, each defendant chosehis own course in grouping together various items. In facing thisunavoidable problem of over-lap, the editors have employed footnotesextensively in making cross-references between the materials containedin various sections, particularly in extracts from testimony wheremention is made of decrees and other documents reproduced in variousparts of the volume.B.

The numerous instancesof ill-treatment which have come to the knowledge of the administrationof justice can be divided into three different causes for suchill-treatment of prisoners.1. Beating as a disciplinary punishment [Hausstrafe] in concentrationcamps.2. Ill-treatment, mostly of political internees, in order to make themtalk.3. Ill-treatment of internees arising out of sheer fun, or for sadisticmotives.I should like to make the following detailed comments on those threecategories:_About No. 1._ In the remand prisons and penal establishmentsunder the Ministry of Justice, there was no need to introducecorporal punishment as a disciplinary measure. The experience of theadministration of justice has taught that a well trained, reliable, andconscientious personnel of wardens is in a position to set up and tomaintain model order under a strict discipline, even without corporalpunishment. The more training and discipline the prison guards have,the less need exists to introduce corporal punishment as a disciplinarymeasure.But if, contrary to this view, one is to suppose that there might bea need to introduce corporal punishment in concentration camps, itappears indispensable that this disciplinary measure and the mannerof its application should be determined, uniformly and unambiguously,for the whole territory of the Reich. It has happened recently thatcamp orders of individual concentration camps concerning this matterand the use of weapons, contained unusually severe instructions whichwere brought to the knowledge of the internees as a stern warning,while the warden personnel was administratively informed that theseregulations which dated mostly from 1933 were no longer applicable.Such a situation is equally dangerous for the warden personnel andfor the internees. It would therefore appear, after the question ofimposing protective custody was generally settled by the competentminister, that in the interests of all concerned, one should urgentlyand clearly define responsibility and legal aspect, furthermore thatthe same responsible authority would have to settle, by means of campregulations generally applicable, the question of corporal punishmentas a disciplinary measure, which is still unclarified, as well as thequestion of the use of arms by the warden personnel._About No. 2._ I cannot concur with the opinions expressed inthe enclosed letter. The present penal law, which I have to enforce,renders liable to particularly severe penalties those officials guiltyof inflicting ill-treatment in the performance of their duties,especially when such ill-treatment is used to extort admissions orstatements. That these legal provisions also reflect the will of theFuehrer and Reich Chancellor is shown by the fact that, during thesuppression of the Roehm revolt, the Fuehrer ordered the shooting ofthree members of the SS who had ill-treated prisoners in Stettin. Thatbeing the legal situation, it is out of order to grant silently onepart of the police forces permission to extort statements by means ofill-treating prisoners. Such a measure would destroy the respect forthe existing laws and would thereby lead necessarily to the confusionand demoralization of the officials concerned.Furthermore, such statements extorted by force are practically withoutvalue if they are supposed to serve as evidence in trials for hightreason. The courts which have jurisdiction in cases of high treasonconsider to an ever increasing degree statements of the defendants madebefore the police as worthless and without any evidenciary value forcourt decisions. This was the result of their getting convinced in thecourse of numerous proceedings that confessions and statements madebefore the police were extorted by ill-treatment.Moreover, I cannot follow the statements contained in the attachedreport in as much as the beating of Communists held in custody isregarded as an indispensable police measure for a more effectivesuppression of Communist activities. These explanations of the Gestapooffice show precisely that the methods used up to now have not beensuccessful in combatting the illegal Communist machine or to hinder itsdevelopment.Experience shows that such police measures may perhaps partially besuccessful but that they never can attain a total suppression anddestruction of an illegal revolutionary organization which alone is ofimportance in the long run. Behind such revolutionary organizationsthere are professional revolutionaries of great experience andfrequently exceptional intelligence. These succeed very soon by meansof cleverly camouflaging all more important functionaries in excludingfor all practical purposes the possibility of betrayal as a result ofmistreatment._About No. 3._ The experience of the first revolutionary yearshas shown that the persons who are charged to administer the beatingsgenerally lose pretty soon the feeling for the purpose and meaning oftheir actions and permit themselves to be governed by personal feelingsof revenge or by sadistic tendencies. As an example, members of theguard detail of the former concentration camp at Bredow near Stettincompletely stripped a prostitute who had an argument with one of themand beat her with whips and cowhides in such a fashion that 2 monthslater the woman still showed two open and infected wounds on the rightside of her buttocks, one 17.7 by 21.5 centimeters and the other 12.5by 16.5 centimeters, as well as a similar wound on the left side ofthe buttocks 7.5 by 17 centimeters. In the concentration camp at Kemnanear Wuppertal, prisoners were locked up in a narrow clothing lockerand were then tortured by blowing in cigarette smoke, upsetting thelocker, etc. In some cases the prisoners were given salt herring toeat, so as to produce an especially strong and torturing thirst. In theHohenstein concentration camp in Saxony, prisoners had to stand undera dripping apparatus especially constructed for this purpose untilthe drops of water which fell down in even intervals caused seriouslyinfected wounds in their scalps. In a concentration camp in Hamburgfour prisoners were lashed for days--once without interruption for 3days and nights, once 5 days and nights--to a grating in the form of across, being fed so meagerly with dried bread that they almost died ofhunger.These few examples show such a degree of cruelty which is an insultto every German sensibility, that it is impossible to consider anyextenuating circumstances.In conclusion, I should like to present my opinion about these threepoints to you, my dear Reich Minister, in your capacity as cabinetmember in charge of the establishment of protective custody and thecamps for protective custody.1. It seems now absolutely necessary that the competent minister shoulddecree unified camp regulations for all camps for protective custody,which shall regulate completely and unmistakably the question ofcorporal punishment as disciplinary measure, and the question of use ofweapons by the guards.2. It appears necessary that the competent cabinet minister order validfor all police authorities an absolute prohibition against mistreatmentof prisoners for the purpose of forcing statements.3. All mistreatments which are entirely or partly due to personalreasons must be prosecuted vigorously and punished under closecooperation of all governmental offices concerned.

In order to take preventivemeasures against this danger, it is to be examined in every single caseof race defilement whether protective custody is necessary after thesentence inflicted by law has been served.For this purpose I request that a short report be made 1 month priorto the discharge of the condemned from prison with the valid judgmentconcerning the case of race defilement attached.Apart from this I request that immediately after termination of legalproceedings in a case of race defilement in which a male person ofGerman blood has been sentenced, the Jewess involved be taken intoprotective custody and reported to this office.No publicity whatever is to be made of this order.

To defend prisoners held in protectivecustody, qualification and reliability are necessary to a particularlyhigh extent. Therefore, in making the selection, a very strict standardwill have to be applied. Mere membership in the NSDAP--as far as it wasacquired only after 30 January 1933--will generally not warrant thenecessary extent of reliability; on the other hand, this qualificationwill not have to be denied merely because the attorney is no Partymember. Only such attorneys can be considered whose attitudes provebeyond doubt that they fully approve of the political plans of theState and of the ideological aims of the movement. For the rest, itwill have to be assumed that attorneys not acting as counsel for thedefense in criminal cases--will generally not defend prisoners held inprotective custody either.I request that attorneys qualified according to these rules to defendprisoners held in protective custody and who, if possible, ought toreside at various places of your district be in sufficient numberentered into a list arranged according to State Police Offices. As totheir qualification I request that the president of the bar then beconsulted, the necessity of a strictly confidential treatment willhave to be pointed out to him. Agencies, other than the judicialadministration, will not be consulted. I then request that two copiesof the list be submitted and that the opinion of the president ofthe bar be attached. Concerning the attorneys mentioned in the list,personal data and qualification for each of them have to be attachedin addition to the character and political attitude of the attorney,particularly the manner of his professional training as counsel forthe defense in criminal cases has to be explained in this statement;furthermore, if possible, whether it can be assumed that the attorneyenjoys the confidence of the State Police Office.Negative reports, if such is the case, are requested.

The cases are decreasing._Hamm_ (Semler)--No detrimental cases. 1 case in Arnsberg with theexplanation that there is no intention to criticize the sentence. Therehave been frequent requests for calling back in cases where no warrantof arrest is issued._Berlin_ (Jung)--The State Police [Stapo] takes functionariesof the KPD [Communist Party] into protective custody after penaldetention. In cases where a warrant of arrest in high treason affairsis rejected, protective custody is to be ordered at once. Furthermore,in 1937 and 1938 a few priests and Jews in protective custody in casesof refusal of warrants of arrest. Protective custody justified on anacquitted sexual criminal (later conviction). No further annoyingclashes._Jena_ (Wurmstich)--Penitentiary inmates as a rule always inprotective custody after penal detention likewise traitors anddefaulters [violating restrictions acknowledged by signature uponrelease]. As regards the detrimental cases, improvement since 1936.Jehovahs Witnesses are arrested on principle after penal detention,but are mostly released after 34 days._Duesseldorf_ (Hagemann)--34 percent of the released are takeninto protective custody. Jehovahs Witnesses are released, if theycountersign. There are frequent requests for calling back in cases,where no warrants of arrest are issued._Stettin_ (Staecker)--Only in very few cases protective custodyafter penal detention. In 2 cases (abortion by female defendant Dr.Buchholz and 1 other case in accordance with section 175a of the penalcode [Sodomy]) protective custody was entirely justified as the resultof the appeal has shown. (Case Buchholz 4 years of hard labor.) Asa rule, Jehovahs Witnesses and high treason criminals are arrestedpending trial._Celle_ (Schoenering)--On principle, traitors, JehovahsWitnesses, homosexuals, and persons guilty of abortion are taken intoprotective custody after penal detention. 4 detrimental cases ofprotective custody: priest, RM 10,000 bail; race defiler, RM 15,000bail; acquitted because of proved innocence; Jew (after being acquittedof acting maliciously against the State); insulter of the SS (afterpenal detention)._Hamburg_ (Drescher)--Protective custody as preventative measureafter penal detention, etc., has to be acknowledged as justified, butnot as a correction of a judicial decision. No special details._Karlsruhe_ (Lautz)--Jehovahs Witnesses as a rule are taken intoprotective custody after penal detention. Protective custody afterrepeal of the warrant of arrest was justified in 2 cases._Graz_ (Meissner)--The Chief Public Prosecutor asked the Statepolice in 2 cases for actions of protective custody, because a13-year-old gangster could not be prosecuted and because the use ofviolence could not be clearly proved to a priest in a case of sexualcrime._Brunswick_ (Mueller)--There is one case, where protectivecustody as a correction of a judicial decision is embarrassing,because protective custody is justified (priest, sexual criminal). Inanother case, (priest, sexual criminal) the protective custody is notjustified. In general the State Police is trying to act in agreementwith the public prosecutor._Oldenburg_ (Christians)--On principle, functionaries of theCommunist Party are taken into protective custody after penaldetention, furthermore, Jehovahs Witnesses in almost all cases. Only afew unsatisfactory cases._Naumburg_ (Hahn)--Frequent request for calling back if no warrantof arrest is issued. The impression has been given that judges aredeciding for a warrant of arrest, because protective custody seems tothem harder than arrest pending trial. Often the criticism of justicebecause of actions of protective custody is not absolutely unjustified.Special example: A former SS Sturmfuehrer (disloyalty) after 1 year ofpenal detention was given another year in protective custody._Nuernberg_ (Bems)--Cases of protective custody after penaldetention, etc., have decreased, although frequently protective custodyis exercised, if no warrant of arrest is issued. Protective custodyas criticism of justice has not occurred any more. On principle, hightreason criminals, Jehovahs Witnesses and race defilers are taken intoprotective custody after penal detention.The minister ends the conversation by stating that in the interest ofjustice those cases are to be regretted where protective custody is tobe regarded as justified criticism of justice, besides no objectionscan be raised against preventative measures.

The most important cases are the ones after arrest pendingtrial. The taking into protective custody is performed more carefullytoday because of the reputation of justice. The complaint has beenmade that the length of protective custody is assuming the characterof punishment. In one case (public notary) protective custody afterrelease from arrest pending trial was justified. Some lawyers refrainfrom submitting a complaint of arrest because protective custody ispending. There are judges who in case of doubt issue a warrant ofarrest in order to avoid protective custody. In one case of criminalproceedings homosexuals were released from arrest pending trial andlater on legally acquitted; during the trial, however, they werebrought to court from protective custody every day. Monks from Dorstenwere taken into protective custody after their acquittal._Darmstadt_ (Scriba)--In one case defendant taken into protectivecustody while still being in court after acquittal. In some casesprotective custody was inflicted after repealing arrest pending trial,release, however, was obtained after objecting by the administration ofjustice. General picture: Decline of measures of protective custody inface of contradictory legal decisions._Berlin_ (Hoelscher)--In 1938 only 3 cases of protective custody.A decline of arrests has been observed._Duesseldorf_ (Schwister)--Frequent requests for calling backif warrant of arrest has been refused. It has even been noticedthat corresponding agreements were made between the investigatingor examining judges and the State Police (Duesseldorf). In one caseprotective custody was justified and in another case one additionalyear of protective custody. Those cases are very rare now; goodunderstanding exists between the court and the State police. Thereforethe impression that justice is being criticized does not exist._Naumburg_ (Sattelmacher)--A mitigation has been noticed, however,there are frequent requests for calling back if warrant had beenrefused._Hamburg_ (Rothenberger)--Cases of protective custody have beenincreased, because the warrants of protective custody are decided onin Berlin. In 6 cases, Jewish women have been taken into protectivecustody because of sexual intercourse with Aryans. In the case ofLaeiss _vs._ half-Jewess, she has already been under protectivecustody for 1 years. State police file notes from police records state:(1) Protective custody, to make the punishment finally effective.(2) Protective custody, to make the served sentence still moreeffective.(3) Protective custody, because of the big number of previousconvictions.(4) Protective custody, to prevent prejudicing the course of justicethrough the interference of lawyers as defense counsel._Rostock_ (Goetsch)--Good cooperation with the State Police, onlypreventive measures have been noticed._Graz_ (Meldt)--No difficulties, not the slightest disharmony, orcriticism of the law.The minister concludes the discussion by indicating that it is to bethe task of the presidents of the courts of appeal to see that arrestsin the courtroom by the State Police are avoided and recommends for therest to remain in contact with the State Police.

With the exception of Wandsbek where the articles ofthe Schwarze Korps evidently were not noticed, it was the generalopinion, expressed particularly by the district court president ofHamburg and Director Hansen, Altona, that the judges were actuallyextraordinarily disturbed by the attacks of the Schwarze Korps. Thestatements made by Senator Dr. Rothenberger have had a rather soothingeffect since there was now some hope for improvement. However, therewere doubts as to whether the Reich Minister of Justice would succeedin carrying his point against the Schwarze Korps i.e., the SS. Thesedoubts were based especially upon the former passive attitude of theministry.I. The attorney general then reported on the penal development of theevents of 9 to 11 November.[195] The former regulation according towhich the State Police is the final authority in deciding whether ornot such a case should be followed up, has been abolished followinga decision by the Reich Ministry of Justice. The Reich Minister ofJustice and Chief Public Prosecutor Joel have stated that it would,of course, be impossible to handle these things the normal legalway; if, at first, the law as such has been changed by order fromhigher authorities, then it would not be possible to prosecute thosepeople involved in the perpetration. Therefore, by way of examplethe conception of violation of the public peace would have to beabandoned. This can be legally justified because the perpetratorslacked the knowledge of illegality since they acted on order. Asfar as the criminal offenses committed during the encounter areconcerned, negligible acts should be disregarded. Otherwise, caseswill be withdrawn, but only by order of the Fuehrer, while seriouscriminal offenses, as for instance rape and race defilement have to beprosecuted. The order for prosecuting will be issued in every case bythe minister after, to begin with, the perpetrators in case they areParty members or members of a Party organization have been expelled bya special department of the Supreme Court of the Party which has beenestablished in Berlin.Goering had strongly disapproved of the events. In his opinion, it wasthe hardest blow the Party had ever received.Comments concerning these events should not be prosecuted under theHeimtueckegesetz if they were occasioned by well founded protest.Senator Dr. Rothenberger pointed out that nothing had happenedin Hamburg, thanks to Gauleiter Kaufmanns attitude whichMinisterpresident Goering had expressly recommended. He asked forunderstanding in the attitude of the Reich Minister of Justice and topass that understanding on to the judges.As far as prosecution under the Heimtueckegesetz is concerned, becauseof comments about the events between 9 and 11 November, he stated thatthe court might find itself in the position where it would have toinvestigate the facts.

The standpoint of the ministry is, which alsofinds approval here, that protective custody measures, insofar as theyare purely of a preventative nature, cannot be objected to; that,however, corrective measures such as have become known in various casesshould not be permitted.Senator Dr. Rothenberger requested _immediate presentation_ of allcases in which the judge is under the impression that the police areattempting to correct the verdict through their arrest measures. Inaddition to this, all cases should immediately be reported in which thepolice effect an arrest in the courtroom.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *    PARTIAL TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT NG-340    PROSECUTION EXHIBIT 257LETTER FROM BOUHLER, CHIEF OF THE FUEHRERS NAZI PARTY CHANCELLERY, TOLAMMERS, 26 JULY 1939, CONCERNING HITLERS DECISION TO PLACE PERSONS INSECURITY DETENTION UNDER HIMMLER FOR WORK IN CONCENTRATION CAMPS                                             Berlin W 8, 26 July 1939                                             Vosstrasse 4The Chief of the Chancellery of the Fuehrer in the NSDAPTo the    Chief of the Reich Chancellery, Dr. LammersSubject: People in security detentionDear Party Member Dr. Lammers,Some time ago the Reich Leader SS made a request to the Reich Ministerof Justice to the effect that some of the people in security detentionbe put at his disposal for important work in the concentration camps.The urgency for this increased, when on the 50th birthday of theFuehrer a great number of persons in protective custody were dismissed.The request of the Reich Leader SS was refused in the letter of 14 July1938 because these persons apart from carrying out work to fulfill therequirements of the penal institutes also did such work as appearedurgent under the Four Year Plan. When, however, the penitentiaryBrandenburg-Goehrden was inspected by the chief of the office formatters concerning pardoning, the Chancellery of the Fuehrer, it wasestablished that a large number of the people in security detentionwere busy painting cardboard soldiers for private firms. Consideringthe far more important work (which can actually be regarded as urgentin connection with the Four Year Plan) which is being carried out byprisoners, for example, in the concentration camp Sachsenhausen and inthe adjoining brick yard, the Fuehrer has ordered that all dispensablepersons in security detention are to be put at the disposal of theReich Leader SS immediately.At the request of the Reich Leader SS, after inspecting theconcentration camp Sachsenhausen in the spring, I supported the requesthe made to the Fuehrer. I was then given the order to ascertain theway in which the persons in security detention were occupied at thepresent time. During the process of my investigation I established whatwas required, and I also received the following report from the ReichMinistry of Justice concerning this matter:   According to the most recent information, there were 4,303   persons in security detention. Of these 4,096 are working; i.   e., 721 of them (16.8 percent) are carrying out work for the   requirement of the penal institutes and other authorities; and   3,375 persons in security detention (78.4 percent) are engaged   in work in connection with the Four Year Plan (including work   for export and for military use). The remaining 207 persons in   security detention (4.8 percent) were not working on the day of   my investigation, in consequence of illness or because they had   to undergo a term of imprisonment.There can be no doubt that the persons in security detention whoare working on the toys mentioned, and who, per person, enable theinstitute to earn daily RM 1.20-1.80 are inserted under the heading ofurgent work for the Four Year Plan.In consequence of my report in Obersalzberg, the Fuehrer, who alreadyhad leanings toward this interpretation after my first report, decidedthat the persons in security detention were to be incorporated into theconcentration camps under jurisdiction of the Reich Leader SS.I have on purpose refrained from informing the Reich Minister ofJustice directly. I request you to inform the Reich Minister of Justiceof the decision of the Fuehrer.I have informed the Reich Leader SS of the decision of the Fuehrer andof my letter to you.

Note by Reich Minister of Justice Guertner to Lammers, 28   September 1939, Concerning Executions of Three Persons Without   Trial and Urging Clarification of Problems Created by Punishment   Without Criminal Proceedings and Without a Sentence.                                _Note_1. _Publications in the press__a._ The Reich Leader SS and chief of the German police reportsthat Johann Heinen, Dessau, was shot on 7 September 1939, because ofhis refusal to cooperate in tasks for the protection of the security ofthe national defense. In addition, Heinen was a criminal who had beenconvicted previously for theft._b._ The Reich Leader SS and chief of the German police reportsthe following have been shot:(1) On 11 September 1939 Paul Mueller from Halle because of arson andsabotage. Mueller had been convicted previously 8 times to imprisonmentand penitentiaries because of crimes violating property rights.(2) On 15 September 1939 August Dickmann from Dinslaken, born 7 January1910, because of his refusal to fulfill his duty as a soldier. D.stated as a reason for his refusal that he was a Jehovahs Witness.He was a fanatical follower of the international sect of the seriousexplorers of the Bible [ernste Bibelforscher, Jehovahs Witnesses].2. _Statement of facts_--Details are not known here since thejudicial authorities had nothing to do with the matter. Whether themilitary judicial authorities have knowledge of it (case Dickmann) isnot known here either.3. _Legal basis for the executions without trial_--The Fuehreris said to have ordered these executions, or to have approved them.Furthermore, he is said to have ordered that the Reich Leader SS shouldmaintain by all means the security within the territory of the Reich,and this order includes also immediate execution in cases of actions inviolation of war laws (report of SS Brigadefuehrer Dr. Best).Upon the request for information about this order of the Fuehrer,Gruppenfuehrer Heydrich replied that the Minister of Justice shouldcontact the Fuehrer directly in regard to the executions.4. _Legal situation_--Should the information made available to theMinistry of Justice be correct, then a concurrent jurisdiction wouldnow exist in the nonoccupied territory of the Reich, that is outsideof the area of combat and operation. There would exist in this area aconcurrent jurisdiction for the punishment of war crimes between thePeoples Court, the military courts, and the Special Court on one hand,and the police on the other hand. According to which criteria shouldthe question of the competency be decided in the individual case?Within the nonoccupied territory the state of public order and securitydoes not permit that any authority should be hampered or disturbed inits activities.The criminal procedure according to the war laws is practically thesame as the procedure before the courts martial. The Special Courtshave just not been _called_ courts martial. I refer to the caseof the farmer Glein from Obersleben near Weimar, who during the nightof 18 September 1939 put fire to his grain-rick and thus destroyed 100hundred-weights of grain. He was sentenced to death by the SpecialCourt on 18 September 1939.5. In a further case (Ernst Georgi of Freiberg), a warrant of arresthad been issued against the defendant on charges of fraud. The StatePolice, Office Plauen, suggested to place Georgi at the disposal of theSecret State Police, and to cancel the trial fixed for the 18th of thismonth, since this file should be treated in a special way according toan order of the chief of the Security Police and, therefore, a transferto the trial in Freiberg would not be feasible.In this case the crime was committed before the war decree[Kriegsverordnung] took effect. After a short period the defendantwas returned to the public prosecutor. The trial took place, and thesentence (10 years penitentiary, and protective custody) was passed on26 September 1939. The Security Police did not refer to a general orderin this case. What the legal basis was for the interference with thecourt proceedings, is not known to me.6. I think it to be urgent that the problem, whether crimes committedin the nonoccupied territories should be punished according to thewar laws, or by the police without criminal proceedings and without asentence, be clarified in general.Berlin, 28 September 1939                    [Signed] DR.

[Noon]Lammers saw me by order of the Fuehrer.He said that yesterday he had informed the Fuehrer about the contentsof my manuscript. The Fuehrer said he had not issued _general_directions. He said he had ordered the 3 executions [Erschiessungen].He also could not give up this right in individual cases, since thecourts (military and civilian) did not prove capable of coping with thepeculiar conditions of war.Thus, he had ordered now the execution of the Teltow bank robbers.Himmler would contact me in this matter before the day is over.14 October 1939                                                  [Signed] GUERTNER   3.

Let me point out that these publications--alwaysusing the same phraseology--were apt to attract the same attention ofat least those persons who participated in the criminal proceedings.On the day before the shooting of Latacz the press had reported aboutthe trial which took place in the hospital for prisoners on remand.Latacz who prior to his transfer was lying in the prison hospital, hada bandage with metal braces. Thus, also the broad public was informedabout his physical condition, and knew that a resistance was hardlypossible in such a condition.

File Note of 6 March 1941 Submitted by Dr. Crohne to the   defendant Schlegelberger, concerning Executions Planned and   Carried Out on the Basis of Dubious Information1. _Gluth case_--In the summer of 1939 the almost 18-year-oldlocksmith apprentice Gluth set 4 fires in Marquardt near Potsdam inorder to disturb the population, and to show off afterwards as anespecially efficient member of the fire brigade. The medical expertstated that Gluth was still in the age of puberty and that the state ofhis development was equal to that of a 16-year-old boy. In the opinionof the experts his acts were caused by the physical and mental changesconnected with the age of puberty, and further by the awakening of thedesire to do important things, which is typical for this age. Sentence:10 years imprisonment.The Fuehrer ordered his execution. According to the statement of SSBrigadefuehrer Mueller, the expert opinion was known to the Fuehrer,but the latter stated that it would be foolish to save such persons,who are a danger for society for further infamous actions. On 19November 1939 Gluth was shot for offering resistance.2. _Trampe case_--Trampe stole jewels and clothes from theapartment of a friend, who was the wife of a soldier, and pawned thesearticles for RM 200. He had access to the apartment in his capacityof repair man. Afterward the soldiers wife and her husband agreedwith Trampe on the damage. Trampe defended himself by stating that hewas by want compelled to steal, that he intended to redeem the stolenobjects later and that he was sure from the beginning that the couplewould forgive him afterward because of their friendship and because ofhis distressed condition. The court accepted his statement as true andsentenced him to 6 years of penitentiary. The press reported that hisdefense was untruthful, and that it was not accepted as true by thecourt.Trampe was shot on 27 September 1940 by order of the Fuehrer. It is notknown here whether the shooting took place merely on account of theincorrect reports of the press.3. _Jackubetzki case_--The milker Jackubetzki had a savingsaccount in the Landeshaus in Breslau. These were the savings from hiswages. One day he came to Breslau without money and wanted to withdrawhis savings. Since the Landeshaus was already closed, he got the ideaof taking away the handbag from a woman walking in front of him inorder to get money for his trip home. He did that, and was sentenced to10 years penitentiary.Referring to a press report in the Nachtausgabe [Evening Edition](not in the file) the Fuehrer expressed, on 9 December 1940, by phonethrough the SS Gruppenfuehrer Schaub his astonishment about the factthat J. was not sentenced to death. In the Nachtausgabe the case wasmisrepresented; it could not be seen from the article that the deedconcerned was prompted by the occasion.On 26 February, Under Secretary Dr. Freisler conferred with SSGruppenfuehrer Schaub and related to him the details of theperpetration, whereupon Schaub considers the case as settled.4. _Kuhlmey case_--Kuhlmey in his capacity as an auditor knew anumber of manufacturers who were drafted into the army. He asked theirwives to authorize him to adjust their allowance cases. He cheated thewives of 4 soldiers by giving them altogether about RM 375 less thanhe had received at the public welfare office. He cheated the publicwelfare office of about RM 3,000 by obtaining allowances on falsepretenses and without the knowledge of the woman concerned, and bykeeping the money for himself. Sentence: 5 years penitentiary. Therestill are some minor cases to be sentenced.On 14 October 1940, Schaub notified us by phone that the Fuehrer hadlearned about the case through an article in the V.B. [VoelkischerBeobachter] of 9 October 1940. If, in the still open cases the deathsentence should not be imposed, a transfer to the State Police willbe ordered. It cannot be seen from the report of the VoelkischerBeobachter, under the headline, Soldiers wives thoroughly cheatedthat K. caused detriment first of all to the welfare office and inaddition also to a few women. It contains some hints though that K.also received subsidies which were not due to the women, but createsthe impression that the total amount of about RM 3,500 was withheld tothe detriment of soldiers wives.

IIIImmediately after I was recalled from the war, I realized that thingswere not as I had expected when plans for the Peoples Court wereworked out. It was overloaded with trials and this because it had tohandle cases which it had certainly not been intended to judge. Thishappened especially in cases which arose in the Protectorate of Bohemiaand Moravia because as yet there was no possibility of transferring thecases to the courts of appeal. But even among cases which are ready forsuch a transfer there are some which should not be dealt with by thecourts of appeal for various reasons.However right it is to exterminate harshly and uproot all the seeds ofinsurrection, as for example we see them in Bohemia and Moravia, it iswrong for every follower [Mitlaeufer], even the smallest, to be giventhe honor of appearing for trial and being judged for high treasonbefore a Peoples Court or, failing that, before a court of appeal.In order to deal with these small cases and even with the smallest,the culprits should surely be shown that German sovereignty will notput up with their behavior and that it will take action accordingly.But that can also be done in a different manner, and I think in a moreadvantageous one, than through the tedious and also very expensive andponderous channels of court procedure.I have therefore no objection whatsoever if all the small and smallestfollowers who are somehow connected with the high treason plans whichhave been woven and plotted by others are brought to their senses bybeing transferred to a _concentration camp_ for some time. Thiswould have the further advantage that dispositions would be takenquickly and that they would be doubly effective because of that, andthat these dispositions could be rapidly modified if by the measurestaken the culprit were brought to a better attitude.One can think, in addition to this, of the many cases of _article90c of the Criminal_ (_Penal_) _Code_, in which, by inconsideratelyexploiting the strong position of the foreign state, persons whohad to cross the border for some reason or other (work, or visitingrelatives) were used to find out something about the neighboring state.This occurred particularly frequently in the border areas which were atthat time Polish or Czech.In any case, I consider it to be an _absolutely_ essential prerequisitethat all these cases should be submitted first of all to the ChiefReich Public Prosecutor of the Peoples Court for penal prosecution. Ifhe considers that _article 153, Code of Penal Procedure_ can be madeto apply, then the Peoples Court will be able to give its consent tothis in nearly all cases. Then the accused would be put at the disposalof the Security Police with the injunction that he be placed in aconcentration camp for a certain period of time.I start from the principle that the conception of minor guilt in thesense of article 153, Code of Penal Procedure is naturally not the samein cases which are suitable for the Peoples Court, as in those casesin which the official judge has to decide. Even if this conceptionis relative and depends on the nature of the offense, a _legalextension of article 153, Code of Penal Procedure_ should surely bemade in order to presume insignificance of guilt for an act which canbe characterized as a crime, as, e.g., crimes in the nature of hightreason in the territory of Bohemia and Moravia.

The question remainedunsettled of whether the Fuehrer wants to request the transmittal ofsentences himself or to hear your opinion in cases in which no sentenceis submitted. At present, however, I do not consider it expedient topursue the matter by sending another letter to Reich Leader Bormann. Iwould, however, leave it to your discretion to inform me briefly andwith the utmost speed prior to the transfer of the prisoners to theSecret State Police about the factual and legal situation of all thosecases in which you think that essential details for the evaluation ofthe perpetrators character or of the crime have not been brought tothe Fuehrers attention. I shall then inform the Fuehrer of the detailsI learn from you as far as the case requires this. The transfer of theconvicted prisoners to the Secret State Police may be postponed inthese cases for a short period until you hear from me again.

In agreement with the Reich Leader SS, the following group oflawfully sentenced prisoners confined to penal institutions will betransferred to the custody of the Reich Leader SS.[201]1. Jews--men and women--detained under arrest, protective custody, orin the workhouse.2. Gypsies--men and women--detained under arrest, protective custody,or in the workhouse.3. Russians and Ukrainians residing in the Reich as non-refugees(excluding Latvians, Esthonians, and Lithuanians) detained underarrest, protective custody, or in the workhouse.4. Poles residing in the former Polish state territory on 1 September1939, men and women, sentenced to penal camps or subsequently turnedover for penal execution, if sentence is over 3 years, or includessubsequent protective custody, (including Kriegstaeter [perpetrators ofcrimes during war time] and persons in protective custody).5. Men _only_, in protective custody (except those sentencedby Austrian Law to workhouse according to sec. 1, par. 2,Reichsgesetzblatt, No. 165, dated 10 June 1932).6. Convicts sentenced to subsequent protective custody--men _only_(including Kriegstaeter). Excepted from this transfer are--_a._ Those sentenced by an armed forces court and by an SS andpolice court._b._ Prisoners of war._c._ Those sentenced by Dutch courts._d._ Those sentenced by former Yugoslav courts._e._ Foreigners, not coming under groups 14. People from theProtectorate and stateless persons are considered natives.Until further notice, the transfer is to be postponed for--_a._ Those sentenced by former Polish courts or by the presentcourts of the Government General. Poles, sentenced by former Polishcourts in the Occupied Eastern Territories can however be transferred._b._ Germans sentenced by German courts in the Occupied EasternTerritories, in the Government General, in Holland, in Norway, Alsace,Lorraine or Luxembourg._c._ Those sentenced by the courts of Alsace, Lorraine, andLuxembourg._d._ Nationals of the Protectorate.Those in protective custody and in the penitentiary with subsequentprotective custody are to be selected for special screening by the[department] concerned, Department XV of the Reich Ministry of Justice,and, therefore, are also not to be transferred immediately if theinstitution is convinced that release from protective custody wouldenter into the question within a predictable time. On account of theirfavorable development during the execution of punishment (not merelybecause of old age or similar reasons). Those who are sentenced toadditional protective custody upon completion of punishment for hightreason and sedition are generally to be selected for this specialscreening. Department XV of the Reich Ministry of Justice will decidewhich of the prisoners who are not to be transferred according to thisshall be excepted permanently from the transfer.The director of the institution is personally responsible for theselection of prisoners to be transferred.If doubt arises in individual cases whether the transfer shall be made,the decision of the Reich Ministry of Justice has to be requested.The same applies if a prisoner who is considered for transfer isstill needed as a witness, etc., in other proceedings or in cases ofadditional sentence by a court.II. The decisive day fixed for lawful sentence is 1 November 1942.Only prisoners lawfully sentenced before 1 November are liable fortransfer. Further directives concerning arrest, confinement in specialinstitutions, and so forth, of those legally convicted later, arereserved.III. Sick prisoners are not exempted from transfer, they are to betransferred as soon as they are transportable. Final decision on insaneprisoners is reserved, transfer at the present is postponed.IV. In preparation for transfer of prisoners belonging to groups I,16, excluding cases of postponement, lists bearing name and currentnumber of each prisoner, separate for each group, and 14 for men andwomen, are to be executed by the institutions. Four copies have to besent directly from the institution to the Reich Ministry of Justicefor the attention of President of the Senate _Hecker_. The firstlists are to be executed according to the status existing on 1 Novemberof this year. Supplementary lists, compare II, also, on the status at1 December of this year and 1 January 1943, and are to be submitted upto the 8th day of the month in question. Institutions having over 100prisoners for transfer, submit partial lists for 100200 prisoners,whenever completed.The lists must be divided as follows:    1. Number of list.    2. Surname and Christian name.    3. Date of birth (day, month, and year).    4. Place of birth.    5. Last residence.    6. Nationality.    7. Institution number.    8. Sentence or measure of security and improvement.    9. _a._ Acting court.       _b._ Executing authority and its reference number.   10. Start and completion of sentence--in case of ex-servicemen,       note that term has not yet started.   11. Offense--main offense only.   12. Able to work--yes, no.V. Prisoners not yet consigned to the proper institution, ortemporarily consigned to other institutions, will be specified by thecompetent institution, to which they are to be delivered as soon aspossible.VI. Slowdown of production in vital armament factories, is to beavoided during transfer of prisoners. Therefore, the transfer has tobe effected gradually with distribution over several months, as deemednecessary by the individual institutions, in consideration of thefactories. At the same time, the institutions most affected are alreadyfilled up because of changes in the execution plans. The number ofprisoners and the time of transfer for the different districts, will beannounced here from time to time.VII. With completion of the transfer to the police, the penal term isconsidered interrupted. Transfer to the police is to be reported tothe penal authority, and in cases of custody to the superior executiveauthority, with the information that the interruption of the penalterm has been ordered by the Reich Ministry of Justice.VIII. Preparatory to examinations of all male penitentiary prisoners,sentenced to terms over 8 years, the directors of institutionsconcerned received verbal instructions at the Reich Ministry ofJustice. These instructions are valid correspondingly for personsin protective custody and penitentiary prisoners with additionalprotective custody, whose transfer has been postponed until examinationof case by department XV of the Reich Ministry of Justice (compare I,par. (4)).IX. The information of this statute is to be given exclusively tosuch directors of institutions, for whom its knowledge is an absolutenecessity in consideration of the incarcerated prisoners. The number ofthese directors is to be kept as small as possible, by concentration ofthe prisoners concerned, in some cases in agreement with the adjacentdistricts. Concerning convicts with a sentence of more than 8 years,such concentration has already been ordered from here.X. I request that special care be taken for the apprehension of allprisoners, including those not delivered to the competent institution,or those transferred to other institutions for industrial reasons.

KUBUSCHOK (counsel for defendant Schlegelberger): I should liketo refer to another complex of questions. Witness, in the course ofthis trial you have often heard that persons against whom prosecutionwas pending or who had already been sentenced were turned over to thepolice. How did these transfers to the police come about?DEFENDANT SCHLEGELBERGER: These transfers are a very sadchapter for anybody who has a sense of justice. They came shortlyafter the beginning of the war in 1939. From publications in the pressGuertner found out that the police had killed people. Guertner madenotations about these notices in the press, had them filed and gave acompilation of these notices through Lammers to Hitler together withhis compiled notes, and he explained the situation in detail. Thepurpose was clear. Hitler should be made to discontinue these things.Lammers actually submitted these compilations to Hitler, but toldGuertner later that Hitler had said that he had not given a generaldirective to carry out these shootings but in individual cases hecould not do without these measures, because the courts, that is,military courts as well as the civil courts, were not able to takecare of the special conditions created by the war. At the same timeLammers announced that Hitler in a further case had already ordered theexecution by shooting.Q. I refer to Document NG-190, Prosecution Exhibit 284.[204]A. I am certainly not making a mistake in saying that that decisionon the part of Hitler was probably the most serious thing which everhappened to this man Guertner, whose main intention was to servejustice. It was an order which Hitler had given through administrativechannels to the police, and the execution of it was assured on thebasis of the means of power then prevailing. The attempt on the partof Guertner to reinstate the respect for court decisions thereforehad failed; but he was not satisfied with that. He wanted to insurethat the administration of justice should be given the authority tointervene in time and to attempt at least to thwart the execution ofthe order given to the police. That, of course, was only possible ifthe administration of justice was informed in time about the order thathad been given to the police, and that request by Guertner was actuallygranted. Subsequently the administration of justice as a rule wasinformed by Hitlers adjutant, Schaub, wherever an order of that kindwas given to the police.The question, therefore, as to how after one has been informed, one canmake an attempt to prevent the execution of Hitlers order involvedgreat difficulties particularly because the police had a time limit of24 hours after which it had to report to its superiors that the orderhad been executed. Guertner then was of the opinion that for thesematters he had to assign the one official in his ministry whom he coulduse as a capable man with the police--who shared Guertners opinionin these matters--and from whom one could expect, on the basis ofprevious experience, that he would show sufficient cleverness. Guertnertherefore charged my codefendant Joel with that mission.When the information about such an order was received, feverish workstarted. First one had to try to extend the police time limit; that is,to persuade the police to delay the report. That alone brought greatdifficulties, because the police official incurred considerable risk.But in some individual cases it succeeded. At the same time, the filesof the case were called to Berlin and all other bits of informationwhich probably had caused Hitler to order the transfer of the personconcerned to the police. Then a detailed report was made of the actand the culprit which justified the sentence, and telephone calls tookplace with various agencies whenever that seemed to have chances forsuccess. Some individual cases were successful. But if it could not beachieved that the order turning over the individual to the police wasrescinded, although everything had been tried, then there was no otheralternative than to issue a directive to the authority which was aboutto carry it out, telling them that they should no longer resist butshould turn over the man to the police.If the Reich Ministry of Justice had failed to give the man up, thepolice would have broken the resistance by force; the condemned personcould not be saved. During the war, civilian and military commandoffices in numerous cases were seriously charged with the fact thatthrough a defense which they had to consider as useless, they hadsacrificed many lives. Such a useless sacrifice it would have been ifthe Reich Ministry of Justice had instructed the prison authorities,via the executive office, to resist the police. The subject of thissacrifice would have been not only threats to officials or civilservants, but to the entire administration of justice, which would havebeen eliminated and its opponents would have triumphed. The actingofficial in the ministry would have been eliminated as a saboteur; andalready at that time he would have been replaced by a person who wouldwillingly and without exception have put the administration of justicein the service of the Party. The individual cases of transfer whichthe prosecution has described have to be evaluated from these pointsof view. I myself, after taking charge of the Ministry of Justice,immediately established contact with Minister Meissner in order todetermine basically that no order for transfer made by the police wasto be executed as long as the administration of justice did not have areport. This intention of mine was again foiled by Bormann. A letterfrom Meissner to me makes this apparent. Hitler had me informed byBormann that the obtaining of the opinion of the Ministry of Justicewas not necessary. Meissner, who shared my opinion, asked me in spiteof that, in those cases where the ministry believed that Hitler was notproperly informed, that a report should be sent to Meissner. I did thatin all cases.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *Q. What do you have to say about the Markus Luftglas case, a case oftransfer to the Gestapo, Document NG-287, Prosecution Exhibit 88?[205]A. This case, too, I no longer remember even though the name recallscertain memories. In my statements I have to refer to the documentsthat have been submitted, and by referring to them I would like todetermine the following: the Fuehrer order to the police was given tothe Reich Ministry of Justice on 24 October 1941, through the usualchannels by the Presidential Chancellery. That nothing happened in thiscase is absolutely impossible. It would have been inexplicable why myletter to Lammers in which I informed him of the release was writtenonly 4 days later, on the 29th, for letters of that kind were answeredimmediately in our office as a matter of course. The fact that ourletter is dated only the 29th shows me rather that in the meantimeunsuccessful interventions had taken place.Now I notice that in this letter to Lammers I informed him thatLuftglas had been transferred to the police for the purpose ofexecution. That is noticeable because the information about the ordersgiven by the police never said anything about executions, but merelystated transfer as the subject of the order. If in this letter toLammers, I therefore informed him that Luftglas was transferred forthe purpose of execution, this can only be based on the information wereceived from the police, and I am quite sure that I formulated theletter in that way in order to inform Lammers how the direct Fuehrerorder--that is, the order to the police--was actually worded and inorder to point out to him the effects of such transfer orders.In conclusion, in regard to this question of transfer I would like tosay that the Hitler order went to the police through administrativechannels. The police had legally and by authority the possibilityto execute the order. The Ministry, on the other hand, had only oneweapon, and that was the word. If this weapon remained without success,the Ministry was defenseless and had to submit to force.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *        C.

Liebscher, 7 months imprisonment.    Heeger, quashed by reason of the amnesty.On 15 May 1935 the 12th Great Criminal Panel of the District Court [12.grosse Strafkammer des Landgerichts] in Dresden pronounced sentenceaccording to which the following were sentenced for violation ofArticle 340[206] of the Criminal (Penal) Code:    Jaehnichen to 6 years imprisonment.    Zikera to 1 year 6 months imprisonment.    Heinz Meier to 3 years imprisonment.    Herbert Meier to 3 years imprisonment.    Tuerke to 3 years imprisonment.

Schupp to 1 year 6 months imprisonment.    Hensel to 2 years imprisonment.    Heinicker to 1 year 6 months imprisonment.    Putzler to 3 years 9 months imprisonment.The proceedings against Liebscher and Heger were quashed by virtue ofthe law concerning exemption from punishment [Straffreiheitsgesetz].After the sentences had been proposed, but before they had beenactually pronounced, the president of the 12th Great Criminal Panelreceived the following communication from the Reich Governor in Saxony:Office sealThe Reich Governor in SaxonyII 84/35                                         Dresden--A, 1. on 8 May 1935                                         Post Office Box: 78                                         Telephone: 24 371To the President of the District Court, Dr. RothDresden--A.Pillnitzer Strasse 41Dear President:I have been informed that a sentence of 3 years penitentiary hasbeen proposed for the defendant Standartenfuehrer Jaehnichen. Withoutwishing to interfere in the proceedings nor wanting to influence youas judge in any way, I should like to point out to you again beforethe passing of the sentence that the circumstances created by therevolution in 1933, which--no doubt--were still affecting conditions atthe beginning of 1934 should not be disregarded when passing sentence.Another point which seems to me worthy of consideration is the factthat one cannot accuse Jaehnichen of a villainous disposition and,above all, that the scum of the earth were to be guarded in Hohenstein.In view of these facts I leave it to you to examine whether theoffenses actually demand a punishment of such great severity or whetheran acquittal might be considered.As Gauleiter I consider it my duty to point once more to theexceptional circumstances.                                                  Heil Hitler!                                       [Signed] MARTIN MUTSCHMANN.Furthermore news was received here that the two lay judges who actedas judges during the trial, Regierungsamtmann Helbig and the merchantPesler, were expelled from the NSDAP after the sentence had beenpronounced. I do not know who was responsible for this expulsion.Finally, the prosecutor, Public Prosecutor Dr. Walther, an SA man, wasapproached by his Obersturmfuehrer after the sentence had been passed,suggesting that he withdraw from the SA.The fact that these measures coincided with the passing of judgmentsuggests some internal connection. This, however, would mean thatvery dubious and most unwelcome consequences have resulted fromthe proceedings which were legally perfectly correct. If, from thecommunication of the Reich governor, which is reproduced above, thereceiver was apt to gain the impression that here his decision as ajudge was being influenced by high quarters, the same might be said,only to a larger degree of the measures taken against the two layjudges. Such action as was taken against lay judges after the verdictwas returned, would naturally leave them under the impression thatthey are responsible before a certain authority for all their actions,carried out in their line of duty while acting as judges. This woulddestroy judicial independence, a factor which until now had beenconsidered the basis of an orderly administration of justice. Apartfrom that the lay judge who when commencing his duties is made to takean oath that he will vote to the best of his knowledge and belief willin this way be subjected to great inner conflicts. The consequencesresulting from such measures against the prosecutor would be no lessserious. This official also would be faced by great conflicts in theperformance of his duty. Thereby the orderly unbiased work of the legalauthorities would be endangered to such an extent that I would feelit my duty to examine, whether under these circumstances it is at allpossible for public prosecutors and judges to be party officials ormembers of the SA.It therefore seems necessary--   1. That in the above case the perplexity caused by these   measures should be removed by some suitable countermeasures, and   2. That provisions be made to avoid the renewal of such   occurrences which are incompatible with the administration   of justice and therefore with the security of legal right   guaranteed by the State.I beg to let me have your opinion concerning this matter and to informme of the measures taken over there. In view of the importance of thecase I should welcome a speedy settlement.                                                Heil Hitler!                                         [typed] signed: DR.

Regarding the detailsof the incidents on which proceedings were based, I beg to referto the enclosed copy of the indictment, dated 25 October 1934, andparticularly to page 21 of the result of the inquiry.On 3 May 1935 the prosecutor, Public Prosecutor, Dr. Walther, proposedthe following sentences:insert page 1 and 2 up toNews was received here that the prosecutor, Public Prosecutor Dr.Walther, an SA man, had been approached by his Obersturmfuehrer afterthe sentence had been passed, suggesting that he withdraw from theSA. The fact that this measure coincided with the passing of judgmentsuggests that there might be some internal connection between the two.This, however, would represent a very dubious and most unwelcome resultof the procedure, which was legally perfectly correct. As a result ofsuch measures the officials would be faced by the greatest of conflictsin the performance of their official duty. This would endanger theorderly unbiased work of the legal authorities to such a degree thatI consider it my duty to examine whether under these circumstances itis at all possible for public prosecutors and judges to be also partyofficials or members of the SA.It appears therefore necessary--   1. That in the above case the perplexity caused by these   measures should be ended by some suitable countermeasures, and   2.

When in cases based on such reports the necessaryinterrogations of the accused or the witnesses are procured by thecourt itself or by the expert of the prosecution, and the policeauthorities are not at all involved in the proceedings, I requestthat State police offices be informed of the proceedings as soon aspossible. If, because of the urgency of a matter, the transfer of filesis deemed inadvisable, the State police office is to be informed whenthe proceedings are instituted and if the occasion warrants, a copy ofthe indictment is to be submitted.The enclosed circular decree was issued with my approval; but I alsomade it known that I expect this interpolation of the competent Statepolice offices not to cause any great delay in the forwarding of theproceedings to the public prosecutor, and that the State police officesare merely transit agencies during this part of the proceedings. Theywill be exclusively concerned with information on the proceedings andnot with the decision about the necessity of further inquiries orperhaps even the question as to whether proceedings are to be turnedover to the public prosecutor at all.With these aspects in mind, I request that the effects of this circulardecree for the police be carefully noted, and that I be informed in theevent of any considerable delays.

These tasks can only be accomplished by the State policeoffices, if all political police-affairs dealt with by the local anddistrict police authorities within their district are submitted to thempromptly. As auxiliary organs of the Gestapo, it is the duty of thelocal and district police authorities to do so.Thus, _all matters in the affairs of the Gestapo are on principle tobe submitted to the office of the public prosecutor via the competentState police office_. In urgent matters of arrest, records may besubmitted directly to the office of the public prosecutor afternotifying the State police office previously by telephone. In such acase, a copy of the interrogation record is to be forwarded at once tothe State police office.The Reich Minister of Justice will instruct the office of the publicprosecutor to direct the requests for investigations of reports ofpolitical nature, received directly by him, to local and districtpolice authorities via the competent State police office._It is the responsibility of the State police offices to speedilyevaluate the proceedings channeled through their offices and to forwardthem without delay._    BY ORDER:                                      [typed] signed: DR.

Party members disregarding this warning, who demand fromthe person who has committed an offense e.g., the payment of a fine,possibly with an additional hint that this would settle the affair,will run the risk of a criminal prosecution.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *A. 15/38                                                      9 February 1938_The question of prosecuting or not prosecuting punishable offensescommitted by Party members, is exclusively a matter of decision by thepublic prosecutors office or by the Reich Minister of Justice._It has been noted, that Party offices have frequently approachedthe regional State police office or other State police officeswith the request not to prosecute punishable offenses committed byParty members, or not to submit their investigations to the publicprosecutors office. Since the officials of the Secret State Policeare at the same time assistant officials of the public prosecutorsoffice, and as such are obliged to prosecute all punishable offenseswithout respect to the person of the offender and without anyspecial invitation from the public prosecutors office, unpleasantdiscrepancies would result if such wishes were satisfied. Nobody butthe public prosecutors office or the Reich Minister of Justice candecide whether or not a punishable offense shall be prosecuted. Thepublic prosecutors office therefore has always the opportunity to makeinvestigations of its own, concerning incidents which, by the Partysrequest are not prosecuted any longer by the Gestapo, or to haveinvestigations made by the police authorities or by the constabulary,which would not exactly be in the interest of the Party. In the future,the lawful duty of the Secret State Police to prosecute all punishableoffenses must be respected, and all cases of doubt with regard to suchprosecution have to be reported directly to the appropriate ChiefPublic Prosecutor through the appropriate Gauleiter, or to the ReichMinister of Justice through the chief of the Party Chancellery, the aimbeing to accomplish an administration of criminal prosecution whichwill comply with the interests of the Party.However, this procedure must be adopted sparingly since the same, andunder certain circumstances more severe, principles will be applied toParty members as to non-Party members.

This suspicion is provedby his general attitude, for instance--(1) The notary joined the German National Peoples Party [DNVP] towardsthe end of 1932 in order to help in preventing the National SocialistGerman Workers Party from taking over exclusive State leadership.(2) In 1933 he was expelled from the Stahlhelm,[212] because he workedopenly against the affiliation of the Stahlhelm to the NationalSocialist State.(3) He did not adopt the German Salute in Court until fall 1937, andin the streets he fails to use it even today. On the occasion of hisinterrogation by the president of the district court on 13 April 1938,he referred to the German salute as the ancient salute given by Germangladiators to the Roman emperor.(4) He is opposed to the existence of the National Socialist Party andits union with the National Socialist State, and he expressed thisattitude not only in a letter to the Kreisleiter of Goettingen, dated11 April 1938, but also during his interrogation on 12 April at thebranch office of the Secret State Police, and on 13 April 1938 by thepresident of the district court.(5) In the plebiscite and general election on 10 April 1938 he votedNo. I appoint District Court Judge Weissgerber of Goettingen head ofthe inquiry.Berlin, 19 May 1938                                       The Reich Minister of Justice                                       As deputy                                   [typed] signed: DR.

These doubts are based on the following occurrence:Since 1 August 1932, Dr. Prelle had been a member of the NationalSocialist German Workers Party, Membership No. 1 255 200. In thecourse of a Party court proceedings he was accused of having made apurchase from the Jew Max Cohn in Naumburg (Saale) on 24 December 1935.On 18 February 1936, during the proceedings he submitted a questionablejustification in which he explained that not he himself but his wifewithout his knowledge had bought picture postcards from the Jew Cohnfor a total of 10 Reichspfennig. He continued, however, to explainthat in view of the speech made on 18 August 1935 by the president ofthe Reich Bank, Dr. Schacht, and in view of the fact that the Reichgovernment was using Jewish banks for raising Reich loans, every Statecitizen was entitled to buy as much as he wanted from Jews. As a resultof this, Dr. Prelle was expelled from the Party by a decision of thePartys Kreis Court at Naumburg (Saale) dated 30 June 1936, because hehad not made the Partys fight against Jewry his concern and did noteven support it.The right to commission someone with the establishment of these factsis being reserved.Berlin, 6 December 1938                                       The Reich Minister of Justice                                       As deputy                                    [typed] Signed DR.

There prevails agreement that it would be purposeless to appointspecial informants in the various branches of the administration ofjustice to inform the Liaison Officer, Amtsgerichtsrat Moeller. Thealready existing circle of informants, to which Moeller should fromnow on belong, is abundantly sufficient to inform the senior president[of the court of appeal] about wishes and difficulties, views on thereaction to new laws, moods of the judges, etc. If from this circlethings are brought forward which cannot be settled directly by thesenior president, Sturmbannfuehrer Eckhardt is prepared to put his SDapparatus at their disposal on instructions from Moeller.2. Senator Dr. Rothenberger expressed the wish to be able to fall backon the information apparatus of the SD in necessary cases, e. g., toascertain whether there is any truth in rumors which by repetition havebecome the subject of a criminal procedure. Sturmbannfuehrer Eckhardtconsents to this.3. Senator Dr. Rothenberger declares that he is prepared to put at thedisposal of the SD subsection current copies of such sentences as aresignificant on account of their importance for the carrying-out ofNational Socialist ideas in the field of the administration of justice,and which are being collected in the appellate court. SturmbannfuehrerEckhardt considers a current transmission of important judicialsentences in this way to be particularly valuable for the work of theSD.4. Sturmbannfuehrer Eckhardt requests that employees of the judicialauthorities be reminded before they travel abroad to keep theireyes open in foreign countries and to record their experiences andimpressions in a report on foreign opinion. Senator Dr. Rothenbergerpoints out that he has been kept informed up to now as to essentials,of one employees impressions on journeys abroad. In future, eachemployee of the judicial authorities is to make a report on foreignopinion at the close of his journey, a carbon copy of which will beforwarded to the SD subsection for information.5. Up to now, informants who are at the disposal of the SD have notbeen nominated for the local court districts Harburg and Wandsbeck.Senator Dr. Rothenberger wants to seek out suitable individuals and tonominate them to the SD subsection.For the rest, the parties concerned are in agreement that cooperation,with the wide consideration for the importance of the sphere of work onboth sides, is best guaranteed by any debatable questions being dealtwith directly by the liaison officer Moeller, either in writing ororally.Hamburg, 22 August 1939.

Will you tell us briefly what your educational background andtraining has been?A. I was born in July 1911 in Altenberg. Then, for 14 years I wentto elementary school, and I went to the Oberrealschule, Fuerth, andthere in the year 1931 I made my final examination. Then I studied forfour terms each at the Universities of Erlangen and Munich. In theyear 1935 I made the first state examination, the so-called ReferendarExamination. Then for about 3 years I was at the Nuernberg-Fuerthcourt as a legal clerk in the administration for training. Then, inJuly 1939, I made the second state examination, that is, the assessorexamination, at Munich. Thereafter, for a short time, I worked for aNuernberg lawyer. Then, due to wartime conditions, I was unemployedfor a while. In October I was taken into the Security Service atNuernberg. That was on 16 October 1939. I was there at the SD duringthe entire war. In 1945 after the collapse I worked for some time as anagricultural worker.Q. After you had passed your first state examination and prior to thetime that you had taken your second examination were you at any timeassigned, while you were in Nuernberg, to the defendant Rothaug?A. Yes, first I had two cases when I was appointed defense counselbefore the Special Court, and that is where I met Rothaug. And then for2 months I was there for my legal training. That was at the end of mylegal training period in February or March 1939.Q. You said that in October of 1939 you became a member of the SD.A. Yes, on 16 October 1939.Q. Before I put several questions to you concerning your activitieswith the SD, will you explain briefly the relationship between the SD,(Security Service) of the Reich Security Main Office (RSHA) and the SS?A. Relations between the Reich Security Main Office and the SS--well,the Security Service, SD, belonged to Office III of the Reich SecurityMain Office. That was the central office of the SD at Berlin. A largenumber of the employees of the SD, had been taken into the General SS.To that extent a rather loose connection existed between the SS andthe SD. In particular, the Supreme Chief of the Reich Security MainOffice was first Heydrich and after his death, Kaltenbrunner, whereasthe chief of the SD who was under Heydrich and Kaltenbrunner wasOhlendorf.[215] Is that sufficient?Q. Tell me how the SD was organized at Gau level?A. At Gau level principally every Gau had an SD department. That,according to the Gau level, was the SD sector, and the extent of thisSD sector was usually the same as that of the Gau.Q. How were these SD organizations which were attached to each Gauorganized? Were there departments in each SD organization within eachGau, and if so, what were these departments?A. In the SD districts there were departments [Referate], as we calledthem. Essentially there were four--III was the designation of the SDoffice in general; III-A, law and administration; III-B, folkdom andpublic health; III-C, cultural fields, including education; and III-D,economy.Q. When you were assigned to the Gau here in Nuernberg for the SD, towhich one of these four departments were you assigned?A. I was assigned to the department of law and administration.Q. And what was your position in that department?A. I was in charge of it. That is to say, for quite some time there wasonly one man in it, really. There was only one person.Q. Can you tell me in general--I will later ask you some specificquestions, but now tell me in general what your duties were as head oflaw and administration of the SD in the Franconia Gau.A. The SD as home information service, in our case through theReich Security Main Office had to inform about all developments invarious fields of German life. I personally had to report aboutall developments in the field of law and administration, positiveand negative developments which occurred in that field of law andadministration, to investigate and to report about them.Q. Being assigned to the law and administration section, did you conferwith the defendant Rothaug in connection with your official duties?A. Yes. On the basis of an instruction received from the inspectorof the Security Police and SD at Munich who was our administrativesuperior, from an instruction through him we had to take up inconnection with the prosecution of the Special Courts in order toinform the inspector, and in the last event, the Reich Security MainOffice, about the pending criminal cases, that is to say, the activityof the Special Courts. In the course of this action, it came to aconference of my chief with the president of the court of appeal, andin the course of that conference Doebig, the president of the court ofappeal, stated that he was not competent for any agreement that had tobe passed here, because as the Public Prosecutor, the prosecution wasunder his control. For that reason on the same day, practically at thesame hour, a conference was brought about with the General ProsecutorDr. Bens. On that occasion, the presiding judge of the Special Court,Rothaug, was present. Bens justified that by saying that the firsthand information about pending criminal cases before the Special Courtcould best be obtained from the presiding judge himself, because itwas he who was in charge of scheduling the cases and therefore couldgive the best information, and for that reason Rothaug was drawn intothat conference. The oral agreement came about to the effect that fromtime to time if my superior office was interested, I should get theappropriate information from Rothaug.Q. In connection with this series of conferences, when did you firstsee Rothaug?A. Well, the conference in question you mean?Q. No. As I understood the answer to the previous question, after youhad seen Doebig and Bens, you were finally told that you would conferin connection with your official duties with Rothaug. When then did youhave your first conference with Rothaug concerning your official duties?A. The first short conference took place immediately after thatconference with Bens and Doebig on the same day in Rothaugs office. Onthat occasion, Rothaug stated that he was quite ready to work togetherwith the SD, as far as information was concerned.Q. And thereafter, did you see him at regular intervals, and if so, howoften did you see him?A. At that time, an agreement was reached between Rothaug and myselfthat principally I should come into his office every Saturday, andthere he would inform me about matters which in his opinion wereinteresting for me--criminal cases--and give me all the information. Onthat occasion, we were also able to discuss any other legal questionsof interest that actually came up; and particularly during the firsthalf year I met Rothaug pretty regularly on Saturdays.Q. Now after these Saturday conferences with Rothaug, did you make areport to your superiors on what was said?A. I sent reports to the Reich Security Main Office about everything inthe way of information which I received from Rothaug.Q. And these reports which you sent to the Reich Security Main Officewent first to your superior located in Nuernberg, and then, as far asyou know, to Berlin and possibly to the head of the SS? Is that right?A. It really occurred that way, that whatever Rothaug consideredimportant he reported himself. I took stenographic notes, and I hadthem transcribed at my office, and on the basis of this information, Iwrote my report to Berlin--of course without any opinion on my part andwithout making essential changes which would not have been within myduties.Q. In these conferences with Rothaug, which occurred fairly regularlyevery Saturday morning, can you tell the Court in general what wasdiscussed? Later on, I want to ask you several specific questions, butnow, if you will, please tell us in general what Rothaug discussed onthese occasions with you?A. Mostly the information which he gave me was in a form ofinstructions about developments of criminality which he explained withexamples of individual cases. He informed me, for instance, that mailrobberies or black-out crimes were increasing and that they constitutedmost of the criminal cases at that time. Then he explained to me inwhat manner criminal procedure had to be developed in order to presenteffective measures against that undesirable development of criminalityand to manifest that in the way of jurisdiction. On that occasion, ofcourse, individual cases were also discussed. In addition to that, healso mentioned matters of legal and political development; also in thefield of substantive law, matters which came to his attention in thecourse of these proceedings, sometimes in the form of short dictationor of handwritten slips which he prepared. It was not only that thecurrent cases were explained to show the development in criminality butalso anything that occurred in the field of law and had to be correctedby higher offices, be it that it needed a negative or positive decisionthat he wanted to have written down and reported to higher offices.Q. Rothaug knew, I take it, that these notes and reports which hehanded to you were passed on by you in line with your officialduty--passed on to higher authorities in the Reich Security Main Officeand in the SS?A. That he knew for certain, and in my opinion that was what he wanted.It could be seen from remarks to the effect that such matters hadto be reported to higher offices so that from these higher officesappropriate countermeasures could be taken.Q. Did Rothaug discuss in these conferences with you the sentences heexpected to give in cases that were to be heard in his court in thenear future?A. Yes, the proceedings in the next period of time which were to betried sooner or later, as far as they were important, were discussedpartly on the basis of the files, partly on the basis of his knowledgeof the files; he gave me a short explanation of the facts and also hisopinion about the legal procedure, the legal dealing with the cases asfar as the application of the facts was concerned in consideration ofthe sentence to be expected.Q. What in general was Rothaugs attitude, so far as he reported it toyou, on the interpretation of criminal law?A. Rothaug, in principle, was of the opinion that particularly in timesof war on account of a certain laxity of security measures, be it dueto shortage of personnel or other things, criminality would increase;that not only an increase of serious criminal cases would occur, butalso of so-called political criminality; and that the activity of theSpecial Courts should be conducted in such a manner that an increaseof serious criminality of that kind should be forestalled; that anyattempt against the State in a political, criminal, or other mannerwould have to be wiped out by severe penalties.Q. Can you tell us what Rothaugs apparent attitude was towardforeigners, especially Poles, so far as the application of criminal lawto them was concerned?A. In my opinion, Rothaugs position was that particularly towardforeigners--Poles and others--that no clemency should be applied; thatespecially these elements had to be met with severe measures in orderto assure that attempts which would be made to counteract the successesof the armed forces should be choked off at the outset. It may be thathe would have used more clemency towards German criminals than toforeigners.Q. Can you tell us whether you are familiar with the decree againstPoles and Jews promulgated in 1941?[216]A. Yes, that is a concept for me.Q. You are in general familiar with the provisions of this decree, areyou not?A. Well, in detail--of course today I couldnt say--but in general, yes.Q. What was Rothaugs attitude toward Poles and Jews prior to thetime that this decree was promulgated so far as you know from theconversations that you had with him and from the reports that youpassed on from him?A. I believe that it was clear to Rothaug that here, if I may say so,there was a gap in the law; that that gap should be bridged; but thata judge with the right political attitude should be in a position, inspite of this gap, to sentence accordingly. He found the juridical wayto pronounce the sentences which he considered appropriate.Q. In other words, would you say that Rothaug achieved, without adecree, and prior to the time that it was promulgated, the same legaleffect that later could be achieved under it?A. That is correct, beyond doubt. As a Special Court judge inNuernberg, he achieved the same success. I should only think thatperhaps measured by conditions all throughout the Reich, he thoughtthat a formulation of these principles was needed.Q. Is it your feeling that Rothaugs outspoken comments on the need forsuch a decree, as was later formulated, was influential in the finalpromulgation of that decree?A. Well, as far as the various things are concerned that finally ledto the decree, I am not well informed about that; but that Rothaugsinformation may have contributed, that I believe.Q. In any event, prior to the time that that decree was formulated in1941, you had sent up in line with your official duty many of Rothaugscomments on what the law, or what the situation lacked at that time?A. That was certainly the case.Q. In discussing the cases with Rothaug in these Saturday morningconferences, do you recall any particular case to which Rothaugreferred?A. You mean in a particular category of a criminal act?Q. No, I do not refer to that. Perhaps my question was not clear. Imeant in spectacular cases which were to be tried by Rothaug, or otherjudges in his court. In other words, did you discuss, or did he discusswith you the more spectacular cases at any time?A. Yes, he did. I remember, for instance, the case of the Dachaucriminal, I think it was Poelmann.Q. One moment. I did not get that name.A. Poelmann. That man Poelmann, if I remember correctly, had takena large quantity of lard from a barn in Fuerth, I believe at night.There may have been several hundred pounds and also other things. IfI remember correctly, Poelmann was sentenced to death by Rothaug. Theverdict I believe was not executed, but through a pardon was commutedinto a long prison term, I think 8 years of hard labor. Rothaug talkedto me at that time about that pardon, which technically reduced thedeath sentence, which in Rothaugs opinion was a correct sentence, to aprison term.Q. Do you remember any other cases that you discussed with Rothaug?A. Yes, one typical case, the case of Katzenberger. That case Rothaugand I discussed also once, and I expressed my opinion that on the basisof information I had received, and also on the basis of opinion on whatwas known of the criminal, that the sexual relationship was not anaccomplished fact, because the law, insofar as I knew, required the actof sexual relation between a German and a party of non-Aryan descent.DR. KOESSL: May it please the Tribunal, I object against theexamination. I object to the examination in this manner, because theopinion which is stated by the witness, the legal opinion which isstated by the witness shows that he is not an expert, and furthermore,he has not been called as an expert witness.PRESIDING JUDGE MARSHALL: We see nothing in the answer inthe nature of which shows anything other than he was just stating aconversation, the way we get it.WITNESS ELKAR: I do not in any way wish to give an expertopinion here. I only wanted to explain why I came to speak about thecase of Katzenberger, because I was asked whether he spoke of any othercase, and particularly this case is one which was mentioned as thecase of Katzenberger. Therefore, may I continue with my statement? Atthe time the facts were not complete, because it was not proved so faras I know that the German woman was doing anything more, according tothe proof, other than that she was sitting on his lap, and Rothaug--Iremember that quite clearly here--said that one had to take the humanfacts into consideration and could hardly expect that a man of thatkind, he meant the man Katzenberger, would act otherwise once the girlhad been sitting on his lap, and that consequently, he considered theproof as given.MR. KING: Now may I for a brief moment digress to anothersubject. In your position with the SD you undoubtedly had anopportunity to observe the political influence that various people withwhom you came in contact exercised?A. Yes.Q. What do you know about Rothaugs influence with the Party men whoran the Gau Franconia. What are your impressions?A. Rothaug had some close connections to the Gau Inspector Haberkern.Haberkern as Gau Inspector could gain an insight in all matters goingon in the Gau, and in my opinion for a discussion of such matters,particularly in the legal field, he took the advice of Rothaug, sothat, since the Gauleiter depended on Haberkern, Rothaug certainlycould have his opinion go to the Gauleiter on legal matters.Q. What men besides Haberkern were influential in directing the affairsof the Gau Franconia?A. Well, first, Streicher was Gauleiter. After he left, there wereseveral staff office chiefs who were acting, and then Holz becameacting Gauleiter. Then Holz went to the army, and at that time theKreisleiter Zimmermann was in charge of the official business of theGauleiter and as far as I know, the relationship between Zimmermann,Haberkern, and Rothaug was very close.Q. May I at this point ask you to clarify one matter. You say thatStreicher, Haberkern, Holz, and Zimmermann, as leaders of the Gau,were, of necessity, members of the Party Leadership Corps?A. Yes.Q. Now in your opinion from what you were able to observe, didHaberkerns reliance on Rothaug, and Rothaugs influence over himresult in Rothaug having a very great influence on the Party LeadershipCorps here in the Franconia Gau?A. Insofar as Haberkern could indulge in the influence as to theLeadership Corps, Rothaug through Haberkern had the same influence, andI should like to assume that in the question of law Rothaug certainlywas the man who was the higher authority so far as the Gau wasconcerned.Q. Do you know whether Rothaug had ever taken an oath of secrecy as acollaborator with the SD?A. Yes, he did.Q. Do you know when that happened?A. That must have been in 1940, because in May 1940, approximately inthe spring of 1940, that is before the French campaign, the conferenceof prosecutors which I had mentioned took place, and I believe a shorttime afterward Rothaug was drafted for the SD and was put on oath bythe SD.Q. What was the higher, more responsible position in the SD, theposition of informer [Nachrichtenmann], or the position of collaborator[Mitarbeiter]?A. May I correct that? There were no official informers. You mean theconfidential agent [Vertrauensmann]? Then there was also the term ofhonorary collaborator [ehrenamtlicher Mitarbeiter]. The confidentialagent was the man who in a certain field of law, penal law or theadministration of justice, occasionally was used for information thathad to be kept secret. On account of the shortage of men, which existedduring the war, it had become necessary to bring in also honorary staffmembers [ehrenamtliche Maenner] who had certain functions, and who in adefinite special field, also had the function of rendering information;the informative material which had come from other places was digestedby them and put together in reports. All such people in the specialfield, that is the field of penal law, were a source of information.The honorary collaborator I would like to put on a higher level thanthe confidential agent.Q. I think I did use the wrong term in referring to the confidentialagent as informer, but in any event, you understood my question, and Ithink I understand your answer.Did you ever attend a trial which was presided over by Rothaug?A. Yes.Q. From your observation, can you tell us briefly how Rothaug conductedhis trials?A. Once it was the case Heller and Muendel, well known highwaytrap-setters [Autofallensteller]. Then the case Feldstengel. There wereseveral others. These were cases of burglary during the black-outs,black-out crimes.May I pick out here the principal matters such as they presentedthemselves to me after my experiences as an SD man. I think I amnot mistaken in assuming that Rothaug considered the trial beforethe Special Court as a means of direction and education and thataccordingly he conducted the main trial on a broad basis and factswhich constituted transgressions against the program of the Party,the directives of the political leadership, such facts were developedto such an extent that the illegal elements which were contained inthe opposition against the political leadership were brought to theforeground. I would like to say that he rather disregarded othercircumstances concerning the defendant, his office, his position. Hewanted to remove those circumstances, to leave them aside, in orderto develop clearly the criminality of the act of the defendant, andjust because he considered the trial as a means for the direction andeducation of the people, he used every means to make it possible for asmany people as possible to attend and underline matters which offeredpossibilities for the political education in order to exert influenceon the listeners in that manner.Q. In your conferences with Rothaug did he express the view that trialswere to be used as a means of political education?A. Yes, of course.Q. From your observation of Rothaugs conduct of trials where he wasthe presiding judge, your answer is that in practice they actually wereconducted that way, as a means of political education; that was thepurport of the answer to the next to the last question, I believe.A. Yes, that was my personal impression, which I gathered from thecomparatively few trials which I attended myself and also frominformation on the basis of the material about the trials. From thosereports, it could be seen that Rothaug had the intention to use themany trials as a means for political education.[217]       *       *       *       *       *       *       *_CROSS-EXAMINATION_DR. KOESSL (counsel for defendant Rothaug): Witness, yourposition was that of chief of a department?WITNESS ELKAR: No, in an Abschnitt. May I point out that therewas no such expression as Abteilung; there were special departments,Referate.Q. So it was Referat III-A?A. Referat III-A.Q. Referat III-A was part of the home forces?A. Yes.Q. Your work with Rothaug was based on general directives, on the basisof which the SD groups had to get in contact with the Special Courts;is that correct?A. The real cause for the contact with Rothaug as presiding judge ofthe Special Court was, as I explained yesterday, the desire of theinspector of the Security Police and the SD in Munich to be informedabout the decisions of the Special Courts, or to remain currentlyinformed about their decisions, because the inspector of the SecurityPolice and the SD in Munich was, at the same time, supposed to sendreports to the Reich defense commissar who, at that time, was inMunich, but whose field was all of Bavaria. A measure of that kind wasof a local nature, at first only for Bavaria, an internal instruction,let us say, from the RSHA, because a contact of that kind did not existat that time.Q. But it was a contact which was taken up all over Bavaria?A. Yes.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *Q. Do you still know what the purpose of the visit of the SD leaderswith Doebig and Bens was and what considerations, what principalconsiderations were discussed on that occasion?A. As I have already explained, subject at first on the occasionof that official contact, taking up of contact, was that from anauthoritative source the reports should be received about pendingcriminal cases, and of course also about legal problems in connectiontherewith. The SD through all its reports from the outside, receivedinformation about the consequences of court decisions on morale. It isclear to us today that the laymans point of view frequently deviatesquite essentially from the facts established in court. And in orderto provide a correction, a possibility of checking our reports, itwas necessary that we establish the official connection to the courtauthorities.Q. Therefore, it was intended that this contact should correct mistakesin the reports received from other sources, which mistakes were basedon reports from laymen and frequently caused misunderstandings of thefacts?A. That is essentially true.Q. Now, you discussed at first the conferences. You came to Rothaugfirst on Saturday mornings in order to get information?A. Yes.Q. Did you stick to that in the course of the following period, or werethere larger intervals between these meetings?A. If I should indicate a period first--Q. I asked only, was that regularly on Saturdays?A. In the beginning yes, the first half year.Q. And later?A. Later, either if an inquiry had been sent to us from some othersource or when, on the basis of reports which we had received fromother sources we had questions to put before him, or when Rothaug onhis part had to report anything on the basis of his activity, andI emphasized yesterday that he was very productive for us, that inthe field of political law, not only in the field of general law,but beyond that and also in the field of civil law, he brought to usexperiences and inspirations.Q. If I understand you correctly, Rothaug dealt with matters ofprinciple of a general nature not, for instance, the treatment ofindividual cases, the manner in which individual cases were handled.A. You have to distinguish here between the--you have to start herefrom the assignment which the SD had as information sources forthe whole country. As I emphasized yesterday, the purpose was toeliminate wrong developments first, to point them out. In case ofthese developments in the wrong direction it could only be mattersof principle in the beginning. According to the instructions we hadreceived, it did not suffice to point out a principal wrong, that isto say a gap in the law, but it was necessary that on the basis ofconcrete examples of definite individual examples that gap be proved,and if possible at the same time in this case, of course, by theexpert, recommendations had to be made for modifications. And on thebasis of this activity individual cases were the subject of discussionsand conferences. Frequently, as far as I remember, it occurred that attimes the individual case itself was discussed as, for instance, thecase of Katzenberger and another case which I still remember.Q. So it was a matter of justifying opinions if individual cases werementioned?A. Yes.Q. It was not a matter of interfering into an individual case on thepart of superior offices, an interference into a pending, into anactual proceeding?A. Well, of course it was possible that the individual case itself,through the leadership office, became known to the Ministry and causedindividual measures. I can give you an example. In the directivesconcerning files there is a provision according to which willsare to be attached to the files of the court. Furthermore, thereis some directive of some sort according to which last letters ofsoldiers who have been killed could be considered, under certaincircumstances, as having the force of a last will. That wasparticularly customary in the air force, that, in case a flier died,these letters were considered, and if there were any provisions inthese letters concerning the heritage, and there was no other proofof any will existing, they were considered to represent the will. Thathappened, for instance, in one case. There was a soldier by name ofSchneiderbanger. The woman who had lost her husband in the First WorldWar, and I believe already one son in this war, lost her last son. Itwas in air combat over London, I believe. She presented to the courtthe letter in which some provisions were included about his luggage, Ibelieve. The court considered that letter to represent his will, andasked for the original from the woman--asked that the original be putin the files. Since for sentimental reasons she objected to that, shewas threatened with a fine or a prison term. That affair raised a lotof discussion. Various offices of the Party intervened, and it camebefore us. I reported that case. In the opinion of the RSHA it wasnot a rare case, but a development which would have to be taken intoaccount either by law or by directive from the Ministry. It was strangethat in this case the reaction of the Ministry of Justice was not theissuance of a general instruction, but an order through channels thatthe woman in this particular case be permitted to keep the letter.PRESIDING JUDGE MARSHALL: One moment, please. The witnessanswered, some little time ago, that these reports to the RSHA and theanswers from them were for the purposes of justifying the opinions ofthe lower court. At that point, Dr. Koessl asked the question whetherit was intended as an interference of those opinions. I couldntobserve that the witness answered that question, and I should liketo know whether it was an interference and not merely an attempt tojustify.WITNESS ELKAR: In as much as we discussed these cases at ourlevel, one could not speak of interference in the individual cases. Howfar the RSHA, through conferences with the various ministries--in thiscase, the Ministry of Justice--could interfere, I am not in a positionto estimate.Q. I am not so much concerned as to how much they could do, but I amvery much interested in knowing what they did do, if anything, in thematter of interference.A. Well, of course we reported with the intention that a wrongdevelopment in individual cases should find correction occasionally,but I am not so familiar with that in the legal field. We receivedinstructions from superior offices that in this one or the other case ameasure from the Ministry or the respective superior office was causedby the report.DR. KOESSL: Wasnt it so that at that time the fact hadbecome apparent and noticed that offices which were outside theadministration of justice were frequently concerned with matters ofjustice; for instance, offices of the NSDAP, Kreisleiters, and so on?WITNESS ELKAR: Yes.Q. Were the conferences also concerned with the attempt of preventingsuch interference?A. I can hardly remember that when speaking to Rothaug that problemwas ever discussed to any extent. Occasionally, when mention was madefrom the outside, that question was touched too; but if I remembercorrectly, Rothaug was of the position that the Party, for instance,was definitely justified to make its intentions known to the court; hesaid in the same manner which, for instance, the administration of mailservice--in case of a fraud on the part of one of the officials--givesits expert opinion about the case, then in the same manner that rightshould be conceded to the Party. For that reason, he offered at alltimes information to the Party and gave also advance information aboutpending cases and an opportunity to state its--the Partys--point ofview.Q. That was originated by law, if I remember correctly, Witness. Wasntit provided that in penal cases against members of the Party, on thebasis of a legal decision, the Party had to be informed?A. Yes, that of course.Q. That is what I mean. Was there more involved?A. For instance, in cases of insidious attacks[218], a directive by theMinistry of Justice was required. That directive, as far as I know,came about in cooperation with the Party Chancellery.[219] It is truethat the Party Chancellery, certainly before it rendered its decision,received information from the Gauleitung concerned with that case. ButI believe that I am not mistaken to assume that Rothaug, even beyondthat in local cases of political significance, tried to get the opinionof the Gauleitung concerned.Q. You told us yesterday that you discussed pending cases on thepoints of view of the general development of criminality. Was that thebasis of your conferences on Saturdays and later on at more frequentoccasions?A. Perhaps I can make the answer a little clearer by emphasizing thecircumstances under which this more intense cooperation with theSpecial Court under Rothaug, in particular, came about. The conferencebetween Doebig and the others was concerned with the officialagreement, as I have said. The position and the tasks of the SD areknown to you. I assume that the SD was in a position to obtain theseofficial informations and opinions from the official sources, but wehad to try to find out about the matters which were, for instance, inthe more detailed files--matters about which information cannot beobtained through regular channels--or to find out about matters whichwent beyond the pattern of an official opinion about a penal case; thatis to say, as we have explained before, a particular experience or anopinion about another court. The obtaining of that information couldonly be the case if as an SD man I had a closer connection to Rothaugbeyond the official character of my mission. And Rothaug, after thatfirst official conference with Doebig--in a conference between himselfand myself--stated that he was prepared to do so.Q. Did you take up contact with other officials of the administrationof justice in your position at that time?A. Here again I have to deal with the administrative organization. Asyou have heard yesterday, the Abschnitt, after the SD Main Office, wasthe next lower echelon. It was not our task as such in all fields,lets say of law and of administration, to obtain and to collectmaterial of information. That task remained to the so-called fieldoffices. I believe we had five in Nuernberg. These field offices as faras I am informed had their confidential agents again; and that therewere legal men--members of the court--among those, is quite known. Asfar as my mission was concerned, that is to say, in order to appraiseand evaluate the material which came from the field offices, I neededof course a qualified person, an expert, who had a wider field ofexperience; and for that purpose I needed Rothaug. He agreed, and healso had the right attitude.Q. Yesterday you spoke about the slackening of the security machineryduring the war. Could you remember that preventive measures againstdanger arising through conditions of war was part of the discussionsand conferences with Rothaug?A. You mean measures to be taken by leadership offices?Q. In order to prevent possibilities of dangers arising from specialconditions, arising from emergencies of war.A. Of course.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *Q. Witness, I want to go over to another point. What concrete reasonsdo you have for judging what influence Rothaug had on Haberkern inregard to the leadership of the Gau; what influence was exerted throughHaberkern on the Gau leadership?A. I know that Rothaug was at the Hotel Haberkern, at the so-calledStammtisch [club table], that he was seen there frequently; I know,furthermore, partly from having been present there myself, in theBlaue Traube restaurant [Hotel Haberkern] that other leading menof the Gau were also present there. For example, the KreisleiterZimmermann occasionally; also the Higher SS Police Leader Dr. Martinand several other people; and I know furthermore that, at thisStammtisch, matters concerning the Gau were discussed. I can furthersay with quite a good deal of certainty that Haberkern, especially inlegal questions, based himself on the advice and actions of Rothaug,since Haberkern, as I believe I emphasized already yesterday, as GauInspector, at any time could have insight into any matters which wereof interest to the Gau and what was going on inside the Gau; he could,of course, on the basis of this insight inform the competent Gauleiter.Q. Did the Gau not have a definite office for handling legal questions?A. Yes, the Gau had a legal office, the Gaurechtsamt.Q. Was Rothaug in charge of this office?A. No. Rothaug was in the National Socialist Legal Workers Association[NSRB] the head of which in Gau Franconia, at times was also the headof Gaurechtsamt, namely Oeschey. In the NSRB, Rothaug had the positionof a Gau group leader of the [group] judges and prosecutors; you knowthat the NSRB was composed of [several] groups.As Gau group leader of [group] judges and prosecutors, Rothaug was inthe Gau Franconia, the judge, the leading jurist, politically; who alsofrom the political point of view, especially the personnel policiesof the Party had the primary influence on it--the most importantinfluence, that is, on the Gau leadership. The Gau leader depended agreat deal on its own initiative or due to the questions by the PartyChancellery, who had to advise and give opinions on certain personnelpolicies, questions of personnel policy. The Gau leader and theGaurechtsamtleiter had to find out Rothaugs attitude.Q. But, Witness, is it not evident already from the fact that the Gauleadership had to turn to Rothaug via the Gaurechtsamtleiter thatthe Gaurechtsamtleiter was the decisive man, the advisor of the Gauleadership?A. One should suppose that from the outside, just from looking at theorganization, but actually I should suppose--I think I can say thatwith certainty, that the Spiritus Rector, shall we say the guiding andthinking spirit even under the leadership of Oeschey, was Rothaug.Q. Now, did you have an insight into the attitude of Rothaug with hisassociates from the political point of view?A. Do you mean the association on the Special Courts?Q. Yes.A. In order to do so it is necessary--Q. Please, did you have an insight or not?A. Yes.MR. KING: May I ask if the witness wants to expand his answeror not. I think the witness should be permitted to if he so wishes.What is the ruling of the Court on that?PRESIDING JUDGE MARSHALL: Yes, he may answer it further if hisanswer requires an explanation. Sometimes a question calls for a directanswer; sometimes that answer is not fair to the witness unless heexplains why. In this instance he may answer.WITNESS ELKAR: Rothaug was operating on the principles fromthe National Socialistic point of view, that was correct; that a judgein a Special Court had to fulfill a certain minimum requirement froma political point of view; that it was not enough for Rothaug thatSpecial Court judges were appointed who, from the technical point ofview, met the requirements, but they must also have, politically, acertain maturity--shall we say, a certain political maturity.DR. KOESSL: Are you finished?A. Yes.Q. Insofar as the political maturity of the associate judges goes, didGross and Ferber fulfill that and Hoffmann--were all of those takenfrom the Special Court by Rothaug removed from the Special Court, or amI correct?A. It was so, the basic attitude of Rothaug toward the requirementsof judges in the Special Courts was that he emphasized occasionally,again and again, that these requirements were, of course, not fulfilledin all the points of the requirements, because in his opinion thepolitical orientation did not exist to the extent he desired it. Hesaid, however, that under his leadership, weaker judges would, shall wesay, fall in line.Q. Did the associate judges of Rothaug suffer politically in any way,such as through the SD, because they had different legal opinions anddifferent conceptions of law, because they had voted differently in thediscussions?A. By the SD? Do you mean to say by that that steps were taken from thehigher authorities?Q. Did Rothaug report about the unfavorable comments about hisassociate judges in order to have them reprimanded?A. That was not the case, for Rothaug stated again and again that underhis leadership the judges followed the corresponding course.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *Q. Can you remember whether it was Rothaug who made efforts to have theseverity of wartime legislation explained to the people--whether theseefforts of his were successful?A. You mean to say that the hints upon the enlightening form of thesesessions brought it about also that the population would understand itbetter now?Q. Understanding on the part of the population, of the severity as wellas a warning.A. As far as I remember, the material that was reported was notsufficient in order to judge this--in order to draw such summaryconclusions.Q. Did you, yourself, make observations that the people, thepopulation, felt that they had been warned?A. That there was a fear of the Special Court is a matter of generalknowledge. That this was in connection with the efforts of Rothaug, Icannot judge whether this was so.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *Q.

SCHILF (counsel for defendant Klemm): I shall now askyou to describe to the Tribunal the work you performed at the ReichMinistry of Justice. First of all, how was it that you got into theReich Ministry of Justice?DEFENDANT KLEMM: That happened in the course of thecentralization [of the administration of justice in Berlin]. TheMinister of Justice, Dr. Guertner, appeared to have the desire thatthe Reich Ministry of Justice, which comprised the administrationof justice of 16 states [Laender], have the Laender represented atthe agencies of the Ministry approximately according to their sizeand their importance. That is how it happened that on 1 April 1935,officials from every former Ministry of Justice in the states wereat that time, I believe, transferred to Berlin. From the Ministry ofJustice for Saxony, four officials were transferred to Berlin. I neverexpressed the wish to be transferred to Berlin. The fact that I too wastransferred to Berlin is probably due to the fact that negotiations hadbeen held between Thierack and Guertner. I dont know though. About mybeing transferred to Berlin, I heard at the middle of March 1935. Afortnight later, I was due to start work in Berlin.Q. What was this sphere of work which was transferred to you at theMinistry in Berlin?A. Because from 1929 I had worked for the prosecution, and also becauseat the Ministry of Justice for Saxony, I had dealt with specialmeasures concerning penal law, I was given at the Ministry of Justicea position in Division III at that time, which later became DivisionIV. I was appointed auxiliary advisor on high treason cases, and asdistrict Referent [Bezirksreferent] for several districts of districtcourts of appeal, both in political and nonpolitical cases.[221]       *       *       *       *       *       *       *Q. As an expert on political penal cases in those days, that is in 1935and 1936, did you have close connections with the Gestapo?A. The Referent for political penal cases for district courts of appealentertained no relations with the Gestapo. When general questions,questions of particular importance arose, they were dealt with by theSpecial Referat, or if there was just one question, it was handled bythe one Referent charged as the SS liaison officer to the police.Q. The prosecution submitted a document, which is Exhibit 31, NG-266.Unfortunately, I can only quote the pages of the German text. In theGerman document book, page 44, following. Mr. Klemm, I suppose you haveExhibit 31 before you?A. Yes, I have.Q. You know the contents?A. Yes, I know the contents.Q. This is a letter of 13 June 1936 from the Reich Minister ofJustice to the chiefs of the various agencies, particularly theOberlandesgerichtspresidenten, and general public prosecutors,informing them that in September or October of the same year, that is1936, a discussion with experts of the Gestapo was to be held, I askyou now whether that document is suitable to confirm your personalstatement that you never had anything to do with the Gestapo?A. That conference was a conference of prosecutor generals and of thePresidenten of Oberlandesgerichte. They were to be informed aboutstopping crimes, particularly concerning high treason and treason.For that reason police experts discussed the subjects. I did notattend this conference, but the speeches made there dealt purely withtechnical matters. They were speeches by experts from the centralorganization of the police, which had the most comprehensive view ofthese matters. I know that it has been tried to find out a little moreabout this exhibit.Q. Mr. Klemm, in this connection the prosecution has submitted anotherexhibit, that is, Document NG-323, Exhibit 32.[222] The first partof the document is a letter from the Reich Leader SS, Himmler, of 18February 1937 to the Gestapo office in Berlin; and on that subjectthe Reich Ministry of Justice stated his opinion on 10 March 1937giving instructions to the general public prosecutors concerning thecollaboration between the office of the public prosecutor and theGestapo.I ask you whether what you have said before is to be changed by thisExhibit 32?A. No, I do not have to change it. That circular instruction by theMinistry of Justice, as one can see from the file note, was draftedin Department II, not in Department III to which I belonged. Besides,this regulation is a purely technical one as to how the files are to behandled during the investigation made by the police.DR. SCHILF: May it please the Tribunal to refer to the factthat the file note which the witness mentioned is to be found on theletter of 10 March 1937, left upper corner. It is IIA and then thereare some Arabic numbers. In this connection, the prosecution has notsubmitted any further documents against you.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *      EXTRACTS FROM THE TESTIMONY OF DEFENDANT ROTHENBERGER[223]_DIRECT EXAMINATION_       *       *       *       *       *       *       *DR. WANDSCHNEIDER (counsel for defendant Rothenberger): Now[beginning in 1933], a great change occurred in your career. Could youtell the Court when and on the basis of what considerations you decidedto give up this quiet and secure life?DEFENDANT ROTHENBERGER[224]: The year 1933 came. On 5 March1933, there were parliamentary elections in Hamburg, as everywherethroughout the Reich. In these elections the National Socialist Partyobtained about 40 percent of the votes. Therefore, it was orderedto form a new government, because it was the strongest Party in theParliament.Until that time Hamburg had the government majority which consisted ofSocial Democrats and Democrats. The NSDAP, which was ordered to forma new government, formed a coalition government with the DemocraticParty, the German Peoples Party, and the German National PeoplesParty.The day after the election, that is on 6 March, the Reich Governorand Gauleiter of Hamburg Kaufmann, called me up. Until that time Ihad not known him personally. He asked me whether I would be willingto assume the position of the acting mayor in this new government ofHamburg. He told me that he had heard about me, and therefore he wasmaking this offer to me. I requested him to give me one day to thinkthe matter over, and then I refused his offer. I gave as a reason thatI considered that my task lay in the administration of justice, that Iwasnt inclined for representative nor for political tasks, and thesewere connected with the position of mayor of a city like Hamburg.Thereupon, he asked me whether in that case I would be willing to takeover the administration of justice of Hamburg as its chief, and Ianswered that I would.Q. In the subsequent time did you again refuse leading positions in theReich? Perhaps you can mention that in this connection here now.A. In March 1933 I thus became Justizsenator, as he was called, inHamburg, chief of the administration of justice. And the Tribunalalready knows that these Ministries of Justice of the individualstates, of which there were, I believe, 18 at the time, in 1935,were dissolved by the so-called centralization of the administrationof justice. Therefore, toward the end of 1934, the Reich Ministerof Justice, Dr. Guertner, approached me in Kiel where we met on theoccasion of a university festival, and asked me whether I would bewilling to become presiding judge of the Peoples Court, which atthat time was being created. I rejected that offer, even though thiswas the second position of a judge in Germany next to the presidentof the Reich Supreme Court. But for administration of criminal lawI had neither the experience nor the inclination. The politicaldevelopment of the Peoples Court, of course, one could not predictin any way at that time. But I remained in Hamburg and when in 1935the administration of justice was incorporated into the Reich and myoffice as chief of the administration of justice, Justizsenator, waseliminated. I became president of the Hanseatic District Court ofAppeals. That is a position of judge which, however, at the same timealso includes administrative jurisdiction. I believe that the Tribunalis already familiar with the fact that, from 1935 on, Germany wasdivided into, I believe, 35 or 37 areas of district courts of appeal,and at their top there was each time a president of the district courtof appeal. In 1936 to 1937 the Reichjustizfuehrer [chief of NSRB]Frank[225] approached me through a representative and asked me ifI would like to be his representative in Berlin in his capacity asReichjustizfuehrer. It was not difficult for me to reject that offer,because during the course of those 2 years I got to know Frank. Thepersonal characteristics of Frank have repeatedly been emphasizedin this trial, but I want to add one more attribute, that he wasextraordinarily vain and that he never forgave me that I could refuseto become his assistant.Q. In conclusion, in regard to this question, would you please statesomething about your additional positions in Hamburg which you had inaddition to your position as president of the district court of appeals?A. In Hamburg I had several extra duties during the years when I wasstill in Hamburg, that is, from 1935 on. That is in addition to mymain duty. I was Honorary Professor at the Hamburg University forcivil law, and there I, in a certain sense, continued my activity asrepetitor, that is, tutor, so to say. That is, I held lectures forstudents. From 1938 on I was president of the Reich Maritime Office.That was the final authority in decisions about collisions at sea andabout the litigations regarding the withdrawing of a license whichresulted from this for captains who were found guilty in case of acollision. From the beginning of the war I was president of the PrizeCourt [Prisenhof] in Hamburg. The Tribunal probably knows the functionsof such a Prize Court. Until August 1942 I remained at Hamburg,and from August 1942 until December 1943 I was in Berlin as UnderSecretary. In December 1943 I again left there, returned to Hamburg,and was a notary in Hamburg.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *Q. We now come to the question as to why you became a Party memberand a Gau Leader [Gaufuehrer] of the NSRB. Those are phases of yourpolitical life during which you participated actually and formally inthe NSDAP. Can you explain why you first became a Party member?A. For reasons of full conviction I became a Party member in 1933,because at that time this party appeared to me to be more united andless split up than the other, earlier parties; and in 1934 or 1935when Gauleiter Kaufmann approached me and asked me to take over theGau leadership of the NSRB, I had already gained my first impressionsand experiences in the struggle between the administration of justiceand the Party. It has been emphasized here time and again how, duringthe first period, after the revolution of 1933, every Kreisleiterattempted to interfere in court proceedings; the Gestapo tried torevise sentences, and it is known how the NSRB tried to gain influencewith the Gauleiter and Reichsstatthalter in order to act againstthe administration of justice. In this respect I gained very badimpressions in Hamburg with the Gaufuehrer at this time of the NSRB,Dr. Haecke. The Reichsstatthalter removed him from office and asked meto take his place, and I do not regret having taken that step becauseonly owing to the fact that I myself held that office, I was in aposition to eliminate attacks on the part of the Party against theadministration of justice from the outset. And that may only have beenpossible because I had a Reichsstatthalter in Hamburg who was smartenough and objective enough to realize pretty soon that any fightagainst the administration of justice can only lead to the destructionof the state itself. I gained influence on the man particularly bytwo events. First, because at the first opportunity when the attemptwas made to put an incapable man in charge of a penal institution, Irefused to do so. I asked to be sent on leave and asked him to assureme that that man would be removed. The case was mentioned here again--aman by the name of Laatz.Q. I shall submit an affidavit about that case.A. To describe the attitude of the Reichsstatthalter in Hamburg, itis important also to stress that the mayor of Hamburg today, who,after the surrender in 1945 was appointed officially and publiclyexpressed his gratitude for the calm and objective attitude displayedby Reichsstatthalter Kaufmann during all these years in Hamburg. Itbelongs to the same field that 2 years later I took over the Gau legaloffice and thereby excluded any competition; and it belongs to thesame complex of questions that during the same year my membership inthe Party was put down as 850,000, which gave me a possibility tostand up more strongly against the so-called old fighters [AlteKaempfer--earliest Nazi Party members]. On account of the identity,of course, between president of the district court of appeals andGaufuehrer, I was envied by all other district court of appeals becausethey continually had to struggle against the Party while I was savedthis struggle.Q. How long did you hold these offices?A. I held these offices until August 1942 when I was transferred toBerlin; then the Gau legal office was dissolved; and the office of theGaufuehrer of the NSRB, I gave up.Q. Then, you became deputy [Under Secretary in the Reich Ministry ofJustice] in Berlin.A. Yes, I became deputy in Berlin until December 1943.Q. What was your attitude toward the SD in Hamburg; could you tell ussomething about that? I am referring to Document NG-825, ProsecutionExhibit 433,[226] in that connection.A. The SD in Hamburg during the first few years had a bad selectionof personnel. There was the usual system of informers; I was spiedupon; the Reichsstatthalter was spied upon and that led to theirremoval. The Reichsstatthalter, when he found out about that, removedthe entire personnel from office from Hamburg. The new men whom heappointed, as far as they were concerned with matters of administrationof justice, came to me in 1939. In the meantime, the directive hadbeen sent down from the Reich Ministry of Justice to the effect thatthe SD should be considered and used as a source of information ofthe state by agencies of the administration of justice; and here alsoI was independent to nominate individuals who would not submit reportsintended to go against the interests of the administration of justice,but who themselves were in favor and sympathy with the principles ofthe administration of justice, and that is the basis for the conferencewith the SD Fuehrer in Hamburg which is contained in NG-825, the factthat I made suggestions to nominate men who were judges and whom Iknew would never submit reports which were against the administrationof justice. Since that time, also in Hamburg, no SD informer appearedin court proceedings, and, as far as I know, no reports were submittedwhich were against the administration of justice.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *         EXTRACTS FROM THE TESTIMONY OF DEFENDANT ROTHAUG[227]_DIRECT EXAMINATION_       *       *       *       *       *       *       *DR. KOESSL (counsel for defendant Rothaug): In what places andwhat official positions were you employed before you became presidingjudge of the Special Court of Nuernberg?DEFENDANT ROTHAUG: I have already mentioned that after theresult of the state examination had become known, I was soon calledinto the Bavarian administration of justice. My appointment was firstwith the public prosecutors office in Ansbach for the so-calledpost-practice [Nachpraxis]. This post-practice was supposed to lastfor about 3 months. In my case, however, it was interrupted after only3 weeks. Perhaps I had proved myself a good student, and after thatI was first transferred to the local court in Weissenburg. I want tomention that I was called to the prosecution in Ansbach on 1 May 1926.Until approximately August 1926, I was working at the local court atWeissenburg. Subsequently I came to the local court at Pfaffenhofen onthe Ilm.Q. You just mentioned Pfaffenhofen on the Ilm. Where were you living atthat time?A. I would consider it more to the point if I would first describe myofficial positions now, up to the Special Court in Nuernberg. Thatswhat you asked me, isnt it?I believe I have already mentioned that I came to the local court atPfaffenhofen on the Ilm. There I was employed until the turn of theyear 19261927. Subsequently I came to the local court at Ingolstadton the Danube. I was court assessor during all this time up till 1June 1927. At that time I became public prosecutor in Hof. In the latefall of 1929 I became Amtsgerichtsrat at the local court of Nuernberg.In the middle of 1933, I became first public prosecutor at the publicprosecutors office of Nuernberg-Fuerth; in the late fall of 1934,district court judge at the Schweinfurt District Court; and on 1 April1937, district court director at the District Court Nuernberg-Fuerth,and there I was, among other positions, employed as presiding judge ofthe Special Court of Nuernberg.Q. You mentioned Pfaffenhofen on the Ilm. With whom were you living atthe time?A. In Pfaffenhofen on the Ilm I was looking for a room. I was advisedto take a room with a family who were from Franconia because I myselfwas from Franconia. This family had a small meat factory outside ofPfaffenhofen on the Ilm. The familys name was Haberkern. That was in1926.Q. Is that the later Gau Inspector Haberkern who was the owner of theBlaue Traube where the club table [Stammtisch] was that was supposedto have been the basis for your political position of power?A. That is correct. That is the same Haberkern who later on became GauInspector of Nuernberg or more correctly was working with Gauleitung ofNuernberg.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *Q. On 1 May 1947 [30 April 1947], the witness Elkar[228] called you,and I quote, the highest authority on legal questions in the Gau ofFranconia. (_Tr. p. 2896._) A little later he calls you theSpiritus Rector in the NSRB.Doebig says you had been the leading spirit in the NSRB. (_Tr. p.1775._)What influence did you exert on the NSRB as a whole?A. First of all, may I say in general, particularly to the introductoryquestion, that I consider that those opinions expressed about me areconsiderable exaggerations. As for having been an authority on legalquestions, that is out of the question. I have always found that otherpeople found it a great deal easier; they always dealt with problemsfar more quickly, particularly those who passed these opinions. Ineffect, the way with us was that questions which concerned my Gaugroup, that is to say, the judges and prosecutors groups, were passedon to me. I then gave my opinion on those questions. My opinion waspassed on to the Gauwalter and he then passed the matters on in theroutine way which is the custom in every state; it was just passed onthen to the next authority.I really dont think that at any time or at any place I had to copewith a problem of world importance.Q. Did you receive immediate instructions from the NSDAP and theGauleitung concerning your work in the NSRB?A. I never received such direct instructions from the Gauleitung.Q. What were your duties as Gaugruppenwalter in the NSRB for thejudges and prosecutors groups?A. In part, that question has already been answered. All problems whichfell within the scope of that professional organization, the JuristsLeague, all problems which reached that organization could come to usfrom any quarter, as they could come from the population itself. Allthose problems were passed on to the Gaugruppenwalter to deal with, andthey were forwarded to that group, the members of which were in someway affected by the event under discussion.On the other hand, naturally, we also had to cope with the particulardifficulties and problems of our members and we had to take care oftheir affairs because, after all, they had joined a professionalorganization like ours for that purpose.I should like to give a practical example to explain this matter, and Iwill give an example of an event which actually occurred, an event withwhich we had to deal.When the administration of justice was centralized, certain officesof judges were downgraded. Here at the district court of Nuernberg,for example, the department chiefs who had had the rank of local courtdirectors [Amtsgerichtsdirector], overnight, and only because theadministration of justice was being centralized, were downgraded by onegrade. That was done without it being their fault in any way. Naturallythat caused a tension, and naturally the people whom it affected werevery much annoyed. They came to see me and told me about the matter.As far as I remember they were not Party members, they were of theolder generation, and they said that they had been treated in a wayin which people should be treated only if they had violated serviceregulations. I then gave a precise account of the occurrence, made areport, and drew attention to the fact that such treatment of officialswas untenable. To begin with, Berlin was against taking any interestand they used the well known slogan, The interests of the people haveto take precedence over the interests of the individual. However, byagain and again digging away at the matter, we succeeded in solving theproblem in a way which was satisfactory to everybody concerned.That was, for example, one of the duties with which we had to deal.Q. As Gaugruppenwalter for the judges and prosecutors groups, did youhave an office of your own?A. I neither had an office of my own nor a staff of my own. I merelyhad my chair and my two hands. The work that I had to do there I did asan individual, and as a rule I wrote it out with my own hand. I thensubmitted the matters to the Gauwalter.Q. Did you wear a uniform in that capacity?A. Except when I was in the army, all my life I have never worn auniform.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *Q. What offices were asked about the political attitude of a judge anda prosecutor, and who made out the final qualifications?A. Political qualifications were exclusively made under theresponsibility of the competent bearer of the sovereignty, that is,the Kreisleiter or the Gauleiter. For these questions they had aso-called Kreis personnel office, or Gau personnel office. When aso-called political qualification of a civil servant was to be made,these offices addressed inquiries to offices where the civil servantor official concerned was known; that is to say, if he was a member ofthe NSRB, they addressed an inquiry to the Gauwalter of the NSRB, or inanother instance to the competent office of the Civil Service League,or to the Ortsgruppe, local group of the Party, or to the SA, or SS.The answers to these inquiries were then gathered at these offices andfrom there, if necessary, by reviewing or examining the facts thatwere reported the so-called political qualifications report of anofficial was made out. This political qualification report was made outbecause the supervisory offices of this civil servant by provisions ofthe law were obligated to form a judgment on this question with theintervention of the Party.Q. How did this develop in your case, and according to what principlesdid that proceed?A. That was an affair which caused the least difficulty. The Gauwaltergave the slip that had been sent in by the competent Party officeto the Gau group administrator who was competent for that official.That was I, myself, in the case of inquiries regarding judges andprosecutors, as long as I was entrusted with that function. I thenreturned the slip after it was filled out to the Gau administratoragain, who on his part then reported to the Party office.It is important to know here that according to an express order a manwho was a Party member was not permitted to be judged as politicallyunreliable as long as a Party disciplinary proceeding had not beencarried out against him because of some established facts.During the time of my activity in regard to that function, it is ofsignificance that at that time almost all judges and prosecutors weremembers of the Party on account of the well known action on 1 May 1937.Q. Did you hear of a case in which a judge or a prosecutor wasdescribed as politically unreliable? And if so, what happened to thatman?A. In my time I did not hear of such a case. The declaration whichwe made in every case had the following stereotyped contents:Circumstances which could raise doubts as to the political reliabilityof the person concerned did not occur.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *Q. The witness Elkar said literally, and I quote, As far as I know,the relations between Zimmermann, Haberkern, and Rothaug were veryclose. (_Tr. p. 2896._) [Page 374, herein.]How did you come to know Zimmermann, and what were your relations withhim?A. I have already pointed out that it was only in the course of 1940that I met Zimmermann by accident when he was at the Blaue Traube.Q. How often did he attend sessions of the Special Court when you werepresiding judge, and do you know why he attended those sessions?A. I cannot remember one single case when Zimmermann attended one ofmy sessions. However, it is possible that he attended at the case ofSchmidt-Fasel, which has been discussed here several times.Q. As to Haberkern, you have already testified that quite by accident,as a young assessor, you met him in 1926 and that for many years youhad no contact with him. How and when did you hear that Haberkern wasin Nuernberg?A. That was in connection with the National Socialist change-over in1933. In those days his name often appeared in the newspapers, andthat was how I discovered that he was in Nuernberg and that he played apolitical role.Q. You have already said that you did not resume contact, not evenwhen against your will you were transferred to Schweinfurt. You havealso given us your reasons. When and how was it that you renewed yourrelations with Haberkern?A. It was in 1938 as far as I recollect. One day Haberkern rang me upand asked whether I was that Rothaug who in 1926 had stayed in hishome. I told him that I was that man, and he was very pleased and askedme to come to see him and his wife. They were the owners of the HotelBlaue Traube, Nuernberg. I told him that I would go to see him someday, and one day I did go to see him. That was how I came to the BlaueTraube.Q. What were Haberkerns offices in Nuernberg and the Gau Franconia?A. He was Gau inspector, the leader of the Hotel and RestaurantAssociation, and he was also an Ortsgruppenleiter. I believe he was theOrtsgruppenleiter of the old city.Q. Through this function did he have any contacts with your officialposition as judge?A. No. The Gau inspector, according to his official duties, has totake care of internal matters of the Party. As a leader of the Hoteland Restaurant Association all he could have done was to find me somerooms for my summer holidays. I had nothing to do with his local group[Ortsgruppe] because I belonged to a different group.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *Q. Witness, did the Party offices in Party affairs have their own legalconsultants?A. In this connection, one must point out that every Party office, eventhe Ortsgruppenleiter, the leaders of the local groups, had their ownlegal offices. I had nothing to do with that matter.Q. When were matters concerning legal questions brought to you?A. Only if simultaneously they affected the interests of the NSRB, andeven then only if they affected the interests of the Gau Group forjudges and public prosecutors.Q. Did the Gauleitung take any interest in the general administrationof justice?A. I never noticed that the Gauleitung of Franconia ever took anyinterest in the development of the legal situation.Q. Did the legal situation play a decisive part in the Gauleitung?A. I never noticed anything of that sort.Q. At the table at the Blaue Traube that has been mentioned here sooften, were there ever any discussions which have been laid downpreviously?A. May I summarize my statement and perhaps say for the last timethat I went to the Blaue Traube with the same intentions that otherpeople had when they went there, and with which other people are in thehabit of going to other pubs. As for conferences with agendas, theywerent held there for the simple reason that that would have beenparliamentary. I met other people there, too, but I didnt meet anybodywho went there with any political aims.Q. Were official matters discussed there?A. Not official, though Party matters were discussed there; butthere, as I think happened in those days at every table in every pub,political things were discussed, and the war was discussed. If somebodywere to ask me today what we talked about, I would not be able to givean account of even one trend of ideas that we discussed there.Q. Did you ever go to Haberkern with your own affairs, that is to say,to get any of your own wishes of a personal nature fulfilled?A. I never bothered Haberkern on any matter of that kind.Q. Do you know whether other people from your entourage asked Haberkernfor his help on their own behalf?A. I heard that they did.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *Q. When the witness Ferber[229] mentioned the doubts which the Reichleadership harbored for your political reliability, he said that the SDtook an interest in your remaining at Nuernberg. From the account ofthe witness Elkar, English transcript, page 2888, [page 369, herein,]we know that approximately in May 1940, you were called to a conferencewhich was attended by Doebig, Bens, and the SS section leader,Friedrich, and that in that way you got into contact with the SD. Whatwas the topic of those discussions when you joined in?A. That matter was rather different. To begin with, Elkar came to meat my office. Then Obersturmbannfuehrer Friedrich called and also aStandartenfuehrer whose name I no longer remember. All those threemen belonged to the SS. Those three men told me that they had come tocall on me because they wanted to introduce themselves to me, and theywanted to try and establish good relations between their office and theadministration of justice authorities.Conditions in general were then discussed, in particular the factthat the administration of justice in certain press organs, above allthe Schwarze Korps, was being subjected to continuous attacks. Theyconsidered that state of affairs undesirable, all the more so as theyalso knew that those articles were generally written on the basis ofone-sided information. They also asked for my opinion as to what Iwould think of all questions which arose here in Nuernberg concerningthe administration of justice, if they were to be dealt with to startwith on a lower level before a report was made on a higher level. Ithought that was a good idea. They asked me whether I would care to bethe mediator. I suggested district court of appeals and the generalpublic prosecutor since as it was, they had told me that they intendedto call on those officials, too.I would like to point out that the three of them had only called on mebecause Elkar had brought them along. As you know Elkar had been withme for training as a Referendar. At that time I had no idea what theSD was about, and what its functions were. The conference with Doebigand Bens was along the same lines and both men saw the point and agreedthat it was quite a reasonable plan which had been submitted to them.They suggested that it might be a good thing to let these matters bedealt with through me because the cases which occurred with me werecases which were to be treated later.I would subsequently be asked to attend that conference. I, myself--andI think it would have been the same with every human being--couldntimagine, or anyway, couldnt imagine very well what was going to happenat that conference. That was the basis on which developments went along.Q. What was Doebigs attitude to Friedrichs wishes?A. I believe I have already answered that question. As usual, he was infavor of cooperation.PRESIDING JUDGE BRAND: May I ask you a question. It wasntentirely clear what you meant in your testimony. You suggested thatinvestigations on a lower level should take place before the higherlevel. Investigations of what--what kind of matters?DEFENDANT ROTHAUG: Investigations is not the word I meant tosay. I wanted to say that by negotiations, matters which concerned theadministration of justice were to be settled on a lower level.Q. What kind of matters--which concerned the administration of justice?A. What we had in mind was attacks which within the sphere of the Partywere made against the administration of justice. I can illustrate thatby an example.Q. It is not necessary now. No, I understood you to act under thissuggestion as an intermediary. Was that your word?A. That I was to become the intermediary?Q. Yes, between what parties or what groups?A. Between the SD and the administration of justice.Q. Yes, and then you said since these matters are all matters to bedealt with by me afterwards, it was reasonable that you should be theintermediary. Did you refer to legal matters?A. That concerned matters--cases which might be brought before me orwhich were already pending before me. Matters in which those agencieswere interested for reasons of criminological developments, but theywere not interested in the individual case as such, in its treatment,or in the decision.Q. And what was the lower level where the matters were to be firstdiscussed?A. The main difficulties which arose and which gave cause to discussthis matter at all were made from up above--from a higher level. Areport was made on some occurrence or other to the SD; the SD passedthe matter on to Berlin; from there it was passed on as a rule withouthaving been settled or even examined to the press where it caused agreat deal of sensation.Q. Was this lower level, to which you refer, the local representativesof the SD?A. Yes, naturally.PRESIDING JUDGE BRAND: Go ahead.DR. KOESSL: Now, Witness, tell us please, what was to beprevented by the discussions, the report to the higher level; what wasit--was it that things were to be clarified after the higher level haddealt with it?DEFENDANT ROTHAUG: One cannot state all that in one reply insuch a general way. With these questions it always depended on whatthe individual case was like; what the attending circumstances of theindividual case was like; and it depended upon what the aims andobject of the participants were. Without going into the matter of theindividual case, it is impossible to give an objective answer.Q. The witness Doebig said, It was only a great deal later after Ihad left Nuernberg that I heard for certain that Rothaug worked inthe SD.[230] Later, Doebig stated that he remembered that the SDLeaders Friedrich and Elkar paid him a visit, but that he could notremember the subject which was discussed. Anyhow, he had never given aninference that the administration of justice would cooperate with theSD. (_Tr. pp. 18651866._) What position did Doebig take?A. I have already answered that question when I said that Doebig wasaltogether in favor of settling matters in that way.Q. How often would Elkar call on you in the subsequent periods?A. He said on Saturdays, and that makes it sound as if he had comeevery Saturday, but that is quite out of the question. He came on someSaturdays, but sometimes weeks passed or months until he came to seeme again about some matter or other. As was the case with many otherthings that were organized within the sphere of the Party, they draggedon and finally nothing much was done.Q. What did Elkar tell you during these discussions about the functionsof the SD, regarding the state of the Party?A. He told me, and I think that was probably right, that the SD as wesaw it was an institution of the nature of an official agency; that isto say, it was an organization of the police type; its activities andfunctions can best be described as an agency that gathered the opinionsof the people; one intended to find out what the people really thoughton official measures taken by the government, that is to say whatthey thought about laws, about judgments, about other administrativemeasures, etc. Those reports were then to be evaluated and passedon the competent Supreme Reich Authorities to enable them in theirgovernmental transactions and measures, to remain aware of the thoughtsof the people. In all these reports therefore, what mattered was notto find out who the people were who were critical and undesirable, buton the contrary, the intention was to find out what people were reallythinking; and therefore, it was undesirable and prohibited to prosecutein any way an individual who stated his opinion in this connection.That was roughly the scope of the functions of the SD.Q. In the English transcript at page 2912, the witness Elkar mentionedthe official character of the SD. I am showing you a book, and wouldask you to tell the Tribunal what the title is.A. The book is entitled Ministerial Gazette [Ministerialblatt]; it wasissued by the Reich Minister of the Interior; it was published in 1938.Q. Please turn to page 1906. At the right hand corner you will find acircular decree by the Reich Leader SS and Chief of the German Policeat the Reich Ministry of the Interior, dated 11 November 1938. Pleaseread out section 1 of that circular decree.A. Under the heading police administration, it says, Collaborationof the authorities of the administration with the SD was the subjectof the Reichsfuehrer SS (SD) circular decree by the Reich Ministryof Interior, dated 11 November 1938. Then, there is a file note.Then--one: The SD of the Reichsfuehrer SS (SD), as informationorganization, intelligence organization for Party and State, has towork in particular in support of the security police and has to fulfillimportant duties. The SD thereby acts on the instructions of theState. That necessitates close understanding and cooperation betweenthe SD and the authorities of the general and internal administration.In reply to inquiries by the SD, information has to be impartedtherefore to the same extent as if inquiries had come from a governmentauthority. The official agencies of the SD, in the same way, areunder obligation to reply to inquiries of the general and internaladministration.Q. Witness, what were the motives for which you met with Elkar anddiscussed matters with him?A. The main cause was that he knew me from his former training period.Q. You may continue.A. I said Elkar knew me since the time when he was in training, becausehe was assigned to me. He was by nature a very faithful person, andat the time when he was not yet with the SD, I was connected withhim by purely human relationships. That is how it came about that atthat time, after he had taken up service with the SD and a connectionwith the administration of justice and the SD was sought, he came tome first for I was known to him; and that is how in the subsequentperiod the entire relationship was purely a matter of comradeship.This is shown best perhaps by the fact that one day Elkar informedme that he would probably be transferred to the RSHA in Berlin forfurther training. Thereupon, I told him that in that case I would alsodiscontinue my activity because I would not start all over again with anew man.Q. What descriptions did Elkar give you about the further handling ofthe SD reports in Berlin?A. He said that the information which I gave him--which was usuallyan opinion on problems which were connected with the collection ofcomments from the people--he would incorporate into his reports.These reports in Berlin would then be divided according to whicheverparticipating Reich agency was interested and put at the disposal ofthose offices.Q. Did you have an insight into questions and tasks which were outsideof the administration of justice?A. I did not gain any insight into those questions.Q. Did Elkar tell you anything about the activity of the SDEinsatzgruppen in the east?A. No. I only found out about that now.Q. Did Elkar speak to you about the so-called final solution of theJewish problem by extermination, execution, or gassing?A. No word was ever spoken about this. I do not believe that Elkar wasinformed about matters of that kind either.Q. Did Elkar tell you about individual SD Fuehrers being entrusted withspecial tasks, as for instance, the feigned attack on the Gleiwitzradio station, or similar undertakings which were the subject of theIMT Trial?A. Matters of that kind were not discussed among us. The examples youhave cited became known to me only here in Nuernberg in the course ofthis trial.Q. What was the basic line of your conversations with Elkar, or thebasic topic?A. As I have already stated, the conversations were mainly on problemswhich were raised by opinions which were gathered from the population.That then led to problems of a general nature, for example, the generaldevelopment of wartime criminality in one field or another.In general, that was the direction in which our conversations developedand that was also the aim of such conversations.Q. Could everything be said in such conversations without restrictions?A. I believe that that was the only possibility at that time in Germanywhere a person could say exactly what he was thinking; and the reasonfor that is because, in this connection in particular, only thetruth was at stake for they were interested in finding out what thepopulation was actually thinking in regard to certain events, measures,laws, speeches, judgments, etc.Q. Do you know in what form these reports were forwarded?A. That is not known to me; I never read such a report.Q. According to Elkars testimony you directed your attention to thedevelopment of criminal and penal proceedings. (_Tr. p. 2890._)What ideas did you represent?A. I believe I have already stated my position on that question. I donot remember a great deal in detail regarding what was discussed atthat time. One question, for example, which interested us and whichdemonstrates how we came to speak about these matters and what opinionwe represented is the question which was frequently discussed in thistrial, and that is the contact of the prosecution during the trialwith the court because of the application for penalty. Opinions fromcircles of lawyers and judges and from the prosecution were gatheredfor this purpose at that time. I myself represented the opinion thatthis problem grew into a problem only because it was treated in awrong manner on the part of the administration of justice. The entirequestion could be solved by a small remark in the Deutsche Justiz,namely, by pointing out that the law does not provide that a formalapplication has to be made, and therefore it would have been sufficientto instruct the prosecutors to refrain from a formal application forpenalty and to be satisfied with adducing the evidence and then statingthe reasons which spoke for and against the defendant. With that, theentire excitement and fuss which was caused by the formal applicationfor penalty could have been avoided.Q. What reason did you give for this suggestion?A. The reason which I have just explained.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *Q. Elkar alleges that you had also talked about pending trials and haddiscussed also the facts as well as the legal situation and futurejudgment. (_Tr. p. 2891._) Was the name of a defendant evermentioned as long as trial was still pending?A. The names of defendants never played any importance in theseconversations. The manner of expression was general. The individualcases, as such, were of no importance at all and their outcome evenless so. It is possible that in the most infrequent cases--as anexample of a definite criminal deed, in order to demonstrate, forexample, the method of the consequences of this crime and to useit in the discussions of general questions, that an individual casewas mentioned, but not in a single case was it like this that Elkarever was interested in a certain pending trial or even wanted to getinformation about the final outcome in advance; such an evaluation wasnot possible in practice at all for the decision could be given only onthe basis of the trial after it was concluded. Thus, Elkars activitywas not aimed at such a goal.Q. By mentioning an individual case, did you ask for the opinion ofthe RSHA in order to find a basis for the political evaluation of theoffense?A. Never. I had no connections whatsoever to the RSHA. Moreover,such a method even in the Third Reich would have been an absoluteimpossibility, and it was never alleged that this occurred.Q. Did you, in any individual case, receive an instruction from theRSHA or a recommendation to direct the trial in a certain directionunder a certain point of view, or to pronounce a certain definitepenalty?A. This, too, was never alleged so far. Such a procedure, too, wouldhave been an absolute impossibility. No office would have dared tosuggest anything of that nature even.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *Q. We started with your relationships to the SD. On what formal basiswere your relationships with the SD? Were you a member of the SD?A. I was never a member of the SD; I dont know either whether therewas such a thing as a membership in the SD; or, whether the peoplewere assigned to the SD from the SS. Only during this trial did I hearthat there was such a thing as an actual membership in the SD. At thattime I assumed that it was an institution of the nature of an officialagency, the personnel for which was appointed by the SS. I never madeany application for any membership in this institution; I never signedanything.Q. Elkar says that in 1940 you had taken an oath as collaborator of theSD; that is in the English transcript at page 2896. Did you take anoath?A. I can say this with absolute certainty, that I never took an oathin that connection. The possibility exists that it was called to myattention that matters which I found out in connection with suchconversations were supposed to be kept secret. However, I do not havethe slightest recollection of this either, so I cannot imagine thatI was approached on this matter in a solemn ceremony. It is a fact,in any case--and this is why the people who worked for me also knewabout these occurrences--that the matters which were discussed there,without exception, I believe, I had also discussed with them and amongthem. Thus, I had no thought of violating any secrets or any pledges ofsecrecy.Q. What was the status called that you had with the SD?A. In former times I never worried about that because for me it was nota question of practical importance as to what I would be designated as,since I had agreed to hold conversations of the type that I used tocarry on with Elkar. Thus, in former times, there was no need to havesome kind of a rank for that, or whatever you want to call it.Q. Did you ever become a member of the SS?A. I was never a member of the SS.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *          b.

The extraordinary objection, which was introduced in 1939, was basedon a bill which had already been drafted. The purpose was to be able tocorrect obvious mistakes in judicial decisions, and thereby to effectuniformity in the practice of the courts.[233]Q. In article 2, section 3 of the law of 16 September 1939, it says:Against final criminal sentences, the Chief Reich Prosecutor at theReich Supreme Court can file an objection within 1 year after thesentence becomes final, if, on account of serious misgivings againstthe justness of the sentence, he deems a new trial and decision inthe case necessary. In paragraph 3 of the same section, it says, Ifthe first sentence was passed by the Peoples Court, the objection isto be filed by the Chief Reich Prosecutor at the Peoples Court, andthe second trial is to be held by the special senate of the PeoplesCourt. According to this, one should assume that the two Chief ReichProsecutors were those who had to decide whether an extraordinaryobjection was to be made or not. Please comment on this.A. This assumption would be incorrect. According to all the regulationsand the constitutional basis of this law, it was without doubt thatsuch a far-reaching statement could be made only by the head of theState for the government, because the extraordinary objection repealedthe sentence which had been pronounced, and returned the case to thestage at which it was before the trial. Thus, if an extraordinaryobjection was raised, a new trial had to take place as if nothinghad happened before. Therefore, through internal instructions, itwas assured that the two Chief Reich Prosecutors, the one at thePeoples Court and the other at the Reich Supreme Court, could raisean extraordinary objection only by virtue of an order of the Ministerof Justice as the representative of the leadership of the State. Andthis is not expressed in the law because according to the Germanconception of a trial, the Minister of Justice cannot make any directstatements in a trial. The two Chief Reich Prosecutors, therefore, madethese statements, as I said, only from case to case on orders of theMinister, which as a rule, were even issued so unequivocably that thestatement which had to be made, with the reasons for it, was in eachcase prescribed to the Chief Reich Prosecutors. Thus, the Chief ReichProsecutor just as the other authorities, for instance, the attorneysgeneral or the presidents of the courts were not prevented, if theythought that there was a cause for it, from suggesting on their own tothe Minister of Justice that he should issue such an order.Q. Witness, the material decision as to whether an extraordinaryobjection should be raised or not was thus made in the Ministry?A. The material decision was made exclusively by the Minister ofJustice. That is, only he personally made it on the basis of a reportmade to him by his Referent personally. In particular it was like that;in case of every decree issued by the Ministry it had been assured thateither by the signature of the Under Secretary or the Minister, or thedivision chief, it was made clear that the decision had actually beenmade by the Minister in this case.Q. Did you ever raise an extraordinary objection without having anorder from the Minister?A. That never happened.Q. You just said that the two chief Reich prosecutors as the officials,as supervising authorities of the administration of justice, forexample, attorneys general, presidents of the courts of appeal, etc.,had the right to suggest to the Minister of Justice that he shouldissue an order to raise an extraordinary objection. Did you make use ofthat possibility?A. I only did so very infrequently on my own initiative. I stillremember a few cases in which sentences pronounced by the senatepresided over by Freisler were concerned. We were _per se_ notvery much inclined to attack sentences pronounced by our own court bysuch a legal recourse. However, Minister Thierack, though not muchinclined to admit objections, occasionally could be made to do so incases presided over by Freisler. The cases which are pertinent here, Imay perhaps describe briefly. The first Senate of the Peoples Court inone case had condemned a person to death because of treason. The factswere as follows: The defendant had transferred a model 38 machine guninto the hands of the enemy; he had obtained the machine gun and givenit to an enemy agent. The enemy had known about this machine gun for along time because they had captured many of these machine guns on thebattlefield. Thus, only attempted treason could be the case, and theindictment was filed in that manner. Nevertheless, the Senate passedthe death sentence. Here the extraordinary objection was permitted. Asecond case was a death sentence against a member of the Protectorate,the opinion of which consisted of three-quarters of a page by Freisler.In this case I suggested that this was not an opinion at all, sincefrom the facts one could not find out at all what the defendant haddone; and because of this legal mistake the extraordinary objectionshould be allowed. This extraordinary objection, therefore, waspermitted.Q. Witness, could the defense suggest an extraordinary objection?A. Yes, the defense counsel could do it, too. The contents of suchpetitions frequently showed that pure clemency reasons were used bythem as arguments in favor of an extraordinary objection, and not basiclegal questions. In such cases it was suggested to them that they makea clemency plea. But, if the extraordinary objection was based on suchgrounds that there was a hope that it might succeed, I submitted it tothe Minister of Justice and supported it. However, and I have stressedthat here before, it was very difficult to get Thierack to allowextraordinary objection to be made in favor of a defendant.Q. May I interpolate a question? Were you, as chief prosecutor, thecompetent official who had to deal with such extraordinary objections?A. No, no, that was the Chief Reich Prosecutor of the Reich SupremeCourt at Leipzig.Q. Can you tell us something as to whether extraordinary objection wasmade frequently?A. During the early part of the war, when the extraordinary objectionwas introduced, that is, until approximately 1942, it was a veryinfrequent occurrence. It was altogether the exception that itwas made. From that time onward, however, their number increasedslowly, but I cannot even give a rough estimate as to the number ofextraordinary objections that were ordered. Originally, the Ministryof Justice, if a report was made by me as to whether an extraordinaryobjection was to be made--for example, in the case of a sentencepassed by the court of appeals--originally the ministry was agreeableto my using again and again the phrase that the sentence gave rise tomisgivings on some points, but these points were by no means of such aserious nature that the unusual recourse of the extraordinary objectionshould be used. That became different only when the new chief ofDepartment IV of the Ministry of Justice, Ministerialdirektor Vollmer,assumed office. I asked him about this one day, and inquired fromhim how it was that these days the Minister more frequently orderedan extraordinary objection to be made. In reply he said, since theFuehrer decree of August 1942, Thierack had all authority in the fieldof the administration of justice and, therefore, in the sphere of theextraordinary objection, too, he had more scope than hitherto.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *    PARTIAL TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT NG-715    PROSECUTION EXHIBIT 112        DECREE OF 21 FEBRUARY 1940 CONCERNING THE NULLITY PLEA               1940 REICHSGESETZBLATT, PART 1, PAGE 405Decree concerning the jurisdiction of the criminal courts, the SpecialCourts, and additional provisions of criminal procedure of 21 February1940.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *                                Part V       Nullity Plea [Nichtigkeitsbeschwerde] of the Chief Reich                              Prosecutor                              Article 34                   Prerequisites of the Nullity PleaThe Chief Public Prosecutor may lodge a nullity plea with the ReichSupreme Court against a final judgment of the local court, the penalchamber of the district court, or the Special Court, within 1 year fromthe date of its becoming final, if the judgment is unjust because of anerroneous application of law on the established facts.

It can order a warrant of arrest already before thedecision on the nullity plea. Outside of the trial, the penal senate,composed of three members including the president, decide thereon.Article 124, paragraph 3, of the Code of Criminal Procedure remainsunaffected.(3) If the Reich Supreme Court reaches a decision based on a trial,articles 350 and 351 of the Code of Criminal Procedure applyaccordingly. The president can order the personal appearance of thedefendant.(4) If the Reich Supreme Court quashes the contested sentence, it canmake its own decision on the case if the facts found by the contestedjudgment are sufficient for this; otherwise it will refer the caseto be retried and newly decided upon to the court whose sentence isquashed or to another court.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *                               Part VI                           Final Regulations                              Article 40                     Validity in the ProtectorateThis decree is also valid for the German courts in the Protectorate ofBohemia and Moravia.Berlin, 21 February 1940    The Plenipotentiary for the Administration of the Reich                                                          FRICK    PARTIAL TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT NG-677    PROSECUTION EXHIBIT 188     EXTRACTS FROM AFFIDAVIT OF DR. ESCHER, GERMAN ATTORNEY,[234]                CONCERNING THE USE OF THE NULLITY PLEA    Dr. Ernst Escher, Attorney            Fuerth, 7 December 1946                                          Rudolf Breitscheidstrasse 8                           _Sworn Affidavit_As a result of questioning by the American prosecutors in the Nuernbergcourthouse, I have the following declaration to make in connection withthe questions set before me concerning the procedure of the so-callednullity plea by the Chief Reich Prosecutor:1. Previous legal situation--It is true that the legal principle that aman cannot be tried twice for the same offense [_ne bis in idem_]is not clearly stated in the German Criminal Code, dated 22 March1924, and since subjected to frequent editorial changes; this maxim,however, was repeatedly acknowledged in the so-called motives of thatlaw. In all of the German legal terminology and literature, no doubthad ever occurred that an individual, once legally tried, could notbe resummoned before a court for the same criminal act, without theintroduction of additional evidence of proof. New proceedings againstan accused who had been legally acquitted, could only be initiated inaccordance with the rules concerning such a reconsideration of a oncelegally concluded trial (arts. 359 ff., in particular, art. 362 of theCriminal (Penal) Code).The accused was therefore assured that, once he had been legallyacquitted, he would not be summoned a second time before the court onthe same charge.These principles were never repealed in the Code of Criminal Procedureitself; they remained unaltered until the present, and the CriminalCode of 1946, issued by the [Allied] Control Council also incorporatedthem.2. During the war, Hitlers government, in a decree pertaining tothe competence of the criminal and Special Courts and coveringother regulations of criminal procedure, dated 21 February 1940(Reichsgesetzblatt 1940, I, p. 405, in art. 5, pars. 34 to 37), createdthe procedure of the so-called nullity plea[235] by the Chief ReichProsecutor and thereby annulled and destroyed this fundamental legalmaxim. Within a year after a verdict became valid, according to thisdecree, the Chief Public Prosecutor at the Reich Supreme Court wasempowered to use the nullity plea against the final sentences of thelocal courts of the criminal divisional courts and of the SpecialCourts if, due to an error in the application of the law to clearlyestablished facts, the sentence could be regarded as unjust.In a later decree, dated 13 August 1942, allowance was made for afurther extension in the use of the nullity plea. Published in theReichsgesetzblatt in 1942 (p. 508 ff.), this decree in article 7,paragraph 2, established the right of the Chief Public Prosecutor atthe Reich Supreme Court to employ the nullity plea, if the decisiondue to an error in the application of the law was unjust, or if therewere serious objections to the validity of the evidence on which thedecision was based, or to the sentence itself.By this decree, it became practically possible to employ the nullityplea against every final judgment and of summoning an accused man thesecond time before a criminal court despite the fact that his case hadalready been legally decided.As is evident in the literature, and especially in the publisheddecisions of the Reich Supreme Court, the nullity plea was notinfrequently employed. I refer to the official collection of ReichSupreme Court decisions, volumes 74, 75, and 76 of the publisheddecisions involving the nullity plea.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *I have been asked how the nullity plea of the Chief Public Prosecutorat the Reich Supreme Court was obtained legally. In this connection,I am only able to state that, according to regular procedure, thechief of the local prosecution--thus in Nuernberg, the Chief PublicProsecutor at the district court of Nuernberg-Fuerth--Chief PublicProsecutor Schroeder in the cases with which I was concerned--wouldsend the documents with an appended suggestion to use the nullity pleafirst to the attorney general at the court of appeal (during the lastyears, Bens) and from there to the Chief Public Prosecutor at the ReichSupreme Court in Leipzig.According to the text of the law, the nullity plea could also beemployed to the advantage of the condemned. In one case, I myself fileda nullity plea with the Chief Public Prosecutor at the Reich SupremeCourt. I was, however, informed that there was no justification for theinstigation of the nullity plea.                                          [Signed] DR. ERNST ESCHER                                                               Attorney          EXTRACTS FROM THE TESTIMONY OF PROSECUTION WITNESS                           ERNST ESCHER[236]_CROSS-EXAMINATION_       *       *       *       *       *       *       *DR. SCHILF (counsel for defendants Klemm and Mettgenberg):Now I am going to refer to the factual contents of your affidavit.(_NG-677, Pros. Ex. 188._[237]) This statement concerns itselfexclusively with the problem of the nullity plea. Therefore, Witness, Iwill ask you whether you consider yourself a particular specialist onthis problem and held yourself to be such an expert when, on 7 December1946, you made that statement.May I point out that the first part--I should like to say one half, thefirst half, is concerned with theoretical matters, that is to say, withthe interpretation of the law. The remainder is concerned with facts.Furthermore, you refer to literature and also to decisions made by theReich Supreme Court. May I ask you to give me your point of view?WITNESS ESCHER: On no account can I say that I am an expert orthat I have special knowledge of the problem of the nullity plea. Wedefense counsels, generally speaking, do not have much time to devoteourselves to scientific problems. As a rule we deal with problems onlywhen they have been brought to us by our practical work. Concerning thetheoretical aspect of the nullity plea, I have never in my practicestudied it, in detail, but when the nullity plea, became topical, Iexamined the questions which a defense counsel has to investigate. Whenin December 1946 I was asked what I knew about the nullity plea, what Ihad to say about my knowledge of this matter, I mentioned the two caseswhich occurred in my practice. It seemed necessary to me, however,to give a brief introduction concerning the situation such as it wasbefore the introduction of the nullity plea and such as I saw it afterthe introduction of the nullity plea. I read several decisions, but Iwould consider it conceit if I were to say that I possessed thoroughknowledge of the problem of the nullity plea.Q. Witness, in your practice you only came across two cases, isnt thatcorrect?A. Yes.Q. In spite of your statement, Dr. Escher, I have to discuss onetheoretical question with you. In your introduction such as youcharacterized it just now, on page 2 under 2 of your affidavit,you have drawn a conclusion, that is a conclusion as to what theintroduction of the nullity plea led to. You said, and I am going toquote literally: The so-called nullity plea of the Oberreichsanwaltwas created and thereby the basic legal principle, _ne bis inidem_, double jeopardy, was revoked and destroyed. As you made sucha far-reaching statement on that point, I would like to hear in briefas to what, at the time you deposited your affidavit, you understood bythe legal principle _ne bis in idem_, double jeopardy. I noted youmentioned that principle twice. May I ask you to give a brief accountto the Tribunal of your opinion as you held it at that time?A. The principle of double jeopardy meant that a person on whom alegal verdict had been passed could not without new facts havingemerged or without the condition of articles 359 and following of theCode of Penal Procedure applying, be retried by a court. Neither theprosecution nor the defendant after legal sentence had been passedcould demand a new trial unless the conditions such as they are laiddown in the law were fulfilled. That is, for example, perjury on thepart of a witness, the finding of new documents or similar fundamentalnew aspects. By that principle the possibility of the nullity plea waseliminated. And that and not more is what I believe to have stated inmy affidavit.       *       *       *       *       *Q. Witness, concerning your opinion on the principle of doublejeopardy, your view that that principle was eliminated by the nullityplea, will you maintain your opinion in the face of what I am going toread to you now? It is a paper by Oberreichsanwalt Retzer, Leipzig,published in _Deutsche Justiz_, volume 1941, No. 20, page 562, Iquote:   It is doubtful whether the nullity plea is possible if the   violation of the law which occurred refers to a condition of   the trial. It is undisputed in the case of a violation of the   principle of double jeopardy. The Supreme Reich Court in a great   number of cases revoked sentences where the principle of double   jeopardy had been violated.That is the end of the quotation. To make it clearer, the Supreme ReichCourt revoked these decisions by way of the nullity plea, and fourcases are quoted and the file numbers are given. My question--now thatI have read this to you--do you maintain your opinion?A. May I say briefly the nullity plea could only be made by theOberreichsanwalt, but not only against the defendant but also in favorof the defendant. It was, therefore, altogether possible that theOberreichsanwalt, if he considered a verdict unjust, should use thenullity plea in favor of the defendant. Such a case does exist, evenif through certain circumstances or errors a man is sentenced twicefor the same crime by different courts, which happened occasionallybecause, for example, it wasnt known in the case of a Nuernberg casethat this man had already been sentenced in Berlin. When that wasrevealed, the Oberreichsanwalt naturally could make use of the nullityplea in favor of the defendant. Such cases evidently are discussed inthe decisions which my colleague has just put to me. In those cases,the nullity plea was a blessing and worked in favor of the defendant,but in most cases, or at least in very many cases, the nullity plea wasused without any new facts or conditions, according to article 359 bythe Oberreichsanwalt against the defendant.Q. Witness, the essence of what I put to you is this: You said, by thenullity plea, the principle of double jeopardy has been destroyed, andthe other author says that the nullity plea was in fact to protect thatprinciple. I wanted to ask you whether you maintain your opinion, andyou have not answered that question as yet.A. I am of the opinion that the question, the way it is put, containsa little misunderstanding insofar as Retzer deals only with onespecial case of the nullity plea where it was made in order to revokedecisions which had been made in violation of the principle of doublejeopardy. Naturally, the principle of double jeopardy was not expresslyeliminated by so many words, but the effect of the introduction of thenullity plea was that a man, on whom a legal sentence had been passedwithout new facts or circumstances having come to light, could beretried by a court. Sometimes it could operate in his favor, but in themajority of cases it went against his interest, in my experience, thatis.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *EXTRACT FROM THE TESTIMONY OF DEFENDANT ROTHAUG CONCERNING A CASEWHERE, AFTER A NULLITY PLEA, THE REICH SUPREME COURT CHANGED A PRISONSENTENCE TO THE DEATH SENTENCE WITHOUT REFERRING THE CASE BACK TO THESPECIAL COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE[238]_DIRECT EXAMINATION_       *       *       *       *       *       *       *DEFENDANT ROTHAUG: * * * In order to elucidate how severe,for example, the Reich Supreme Court, in particular, generally judgedthe situation in those cases [sabotage cases during wartime] isdemonstrated by the case in the list of the death sentences of theSpecial Court Nuernberg in which the notation is made--Sentence of theReich Supreme Court. I believe it was in 1941. The following were thefacts:A Pole had given a civilian pair of pants to a Serbian PW in order toenable him to flee into his home country. In fact, the Serbian prisonerdid escape. The Pole confessed; however, he denied decisively that hehad intended that the Serb should join the Tito forces; that he onlydid it out of compassion. Therefore, we sentenced him to a penal camp,3 years in a penal camp. Thereupon, a nullity plea was filed, the ReichSupreme Court changed the sentence, did not even refer it back to us,but quickly sentenced the Pole to death by stating that, in theiropinion the facts which we had already determined ourselves, as I havejust told you in a few brief sentences now, were absolutely sufficientto pronounce the death sentence.And I still recall that the important point of view was--and I rememberit, because I was interested--that it could not matter in wartime whatconcrete intentions he had but that it was absolutely sufficient thatthe Pole could have counted upon the possibility that the Serb wouldjoin Titos forces.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *2.

In such cases, I will take the necessary steps. Inorder that such judgments be dealt with rapidly you, my Fuehrer, havecreated the nullity plea and the extraordinary objection for criminalcases. For civil proceedings, the right of application by the ChiefReich Prosecutor at the Reich Supreme Court for the resumption of theprocedure, could serve the same purpose as provided in an ordinancedrafted by myself. So as to avoid all such wrong verdicts, the publicprosecutors office is called on, in this draft, to participatein civil proceedings, and should stress the right of the nationalcommunity against the individual interests of the opposing parties.Apart from this it is desirable to educate the judges more and more toa correct way of thinking, conscious of the national destiny. For thispurpose it would be invaluable if you, my Fuehrer, could let me know ifa verdict does not meet with your approval. The judges are responsibleto you, my Fuehrer; they are conscious of this responsibility and arefirmly resolved to discharge their duties accordingly.I feel that it is my duty to you, my Fuehrer, to bring it to theattention of the judges if a decision does not conform to the opinionof the State leadership.

It has come to my knowledge that just recently a number ofsentences passed have roused the strong disapproval of the Fuehrer.I do not know exactly which sentences are concerned, but I haveascertained for myself that now and then sentences are pronouncedwhich are quite untenable. In such cases I shall act with the utmostenergy and decision. It is, however, of vital importance for theadministration of justice and its standing in the Reich, that the headof the Ministry of Justice should know to which sentences the Fuehrerobjects; for nothing is more dangerous than the creation of a so-calledatmosphere, of the causes of which the Minister of Justice is unaware.That is the reason for my request to the Fuehrer in the last paragraphof my letter. I repeat, this attempt to establish a direct contactbetween the Fuehrer and the Minister of Justice must be made at once ifirreparable damage is to be avoided.In explanation of the first paragraph of my letter, I enclose thementioned draft of the decree, which is to be provisionally discussedhere on the 17th of this month with the Reich Chancellery. Basicapproval has already been received from the Reich Finance Minister, theReich Minister of the Interior and the Reich Minister of Economics.Participation by the prosecuting authorities in civil cases was alreadyknown in Roman law. Nowadays, in the recently published Italian code ofcivil procedure, this participation has been extended, following thegeneral line of my draft, because, as is indicated in the report to theking, a purely platonic participation is no longer sufficient.The deceased Reich Minister Dr. Guertner, during the last days he wasstill in office, advised me to examine the question of whether anextraordinary objection should be created for civil as in criminalcases. I have adopted the right of the Chief Reich Prosecutor to askfor the reopening of a case but deliberately with such limitations,that by human standards no offense can be created thereby; this specialreopening will only be put into practice in so-called secular cases.

For this purpose, the public prosecutor may be presentat all proceedings and may give his opinion regarding the judgmentwhich is to be passed. He may submit facts and evidence insofar asthis does not affect the rights of either party with regard to thedisagreement.(2) Regulations which already provide for participation by the publicprosecutor in matters of civil law, are not affected.

Article 3(1) The high senate for civil matters at the Reich Supreme Court makesa decision by writ, on application.(2) The participants in the previous proceeding may be heard.                               Article 4(1) If the Reich Supreme Court grants the application of theChief Reich Prosecutor, it will again take up--as far as this isnecessary--the previous proceedings and the judgments passed, and willorder new proceedings and a new judgment.(2) The Reich Supreme Court determines whether the new proceedings andjudgment will be dealt with by the court previously concerned with thecase, or will be replaced by another court of the same standing, orwhether it will be dealt with by a senate of the Reich Supreme Court.                               Article 5(1) The new proceedings will be considered a continuation of theprevious proceedings.(2) The court is bound by the legal and factual judgment on which theReich Supreme Court based its writ.(3) No court fees will be charged for the new proceedings and judgment.

I askpermission to consider the telephone call made on Sunday, 22 March,concerning the case of Schlitt at Wilhelmshaven as granting my request,and I express my sincerest thanks for this.I entirely agree with your demand, my Fuehrer, for very severepunishment for criminals [Verbrechertum], and I assure you thatthe judges have honest will to comply with your demand. Constantinstructions in order to strengthen them in this intention and theincrease of threats of legal punishment have resulted in a considerabledecrease of the number of sentences to which objections have been madefrom this point of view, out of a total annual number of more than300,000.I shall continue to try to reduce this number still more, and ifnecessary, I shall not shrink from personal measures as before.In the criminal case against the building technician Ewald Schlitt fromWilhelmshaven, I have applied through the Chief Reich Prosecutor foran extraordinary objection against the sentence at the special senateof the Reich Supreme Court.

[Initial] L [Lammers]Dear Reich Minister Dr. Lammers:I am very much obliged to the Fuehrer for having complied with myrequest to take the sentence of the Special Court in Munich againstAnton Scharff as an opportunity to have me informed about his viewsas to the proper expiation for crimes committed under cover of theblack-out. I shall again inform the presidents of the district courtsof appeal and the attorneys general of this view of the Fuehrer as soonas possible.The short notice in the Munich edition of the Voelkischer Beobachterdated 24 May, which was enclosed in your letter of 29 May, does notmake the sentence comprehensible in my opinion either. In the judgmentthe following facts are stated. Scharff, who was not quite 19 years oldwhen he committed the crime, is the only child of a painters familyand comes from a very poor home. On account of an infection of thelungs his father is unable to work as a painter and his only occupationis in the office of the Nazi Party Public Welfare Organization inPfaffenhofen on the Ilm. The parents have barely the necessaries oflife.Since the middle of 1937 the defendant was thrown on his own resourcesand gained his living without parental help and away from home onpoorly paid jobs, first by agricultural work and recently as anunskilled worker with a firm in Augsburg. His conduct and efficiencywere satisfactory. As the defendant, whose wages amounted to 50 pfennigper hour, could not make both ends meet and contracted harassing debts,he absented himself from work several times in order to get betterearnings through odd jobs, such as helping in the loading of wagons atthe railroad station and also in this way to obtain dismissal from hisemployers who would not discharge him.Around Easter 1941 he left his job after having spent his last wages.He reckoned with his early drafting into armed forces, since he hadvolunteered for an antitank unit and, with consent of his father, hadenlisted for 12 years in order to bring his financial troubles to afinal stop. This time he did not find work at the railroad station.Thus, it happened that he soon found himself without means, and hitupon the idea of getting money by stealing a handbag. After havingwatched the district in question, he thought that on 18 April 1941 atabout 2200 hours he had found a fitting opportunity and snatched thehandbag from under the arm of a young woman whom he had followed forsome time when she was about to unlock the door of her house. Whenthe woman, a war widow, called for help and people approached, thedefendant fled and threw away the handbag but was arrested a short timelater without offering resistance.On the basis of these facts which help to elucidate the peculiarityof the offense and the character of the perpetrator, the court wasinduced to pass a mild sentence. Since no violence could be proved,the defendant was not convicted of robbery, but only of theft. Asextenuating circumstances, the clean conduct sheet, satisfactorywork, his youth and immaturity, as well as the hard life, full ofdeprivations, led by defendant, were put to his account by the courtand for these reasons the death penalty was dispensed with.I ask you to assure the Fuehrer that my unwavering attention isdirected to the safeguarding of the protection of the people againstpublic enemies through the severe punishment of criminals.

He who tries to escape this duty, however, has no right to live   among us as a member of the German national community.   We shall be equally unrelenting in our fight for the   preservation of our people as we were in our fight for power.   At a time when thousands of our best men, fathers and sons of   our people, are being killed in battle, nobody shall hope to   live who attempts to depreciate at home the sacrifice which is   made at the front. No matter under which disguise the attempt is   made to disturb this German front, to undermine the resistance   power of our people, to weaken the authority of the regime or to   sabotage production on the home front; the culprit shall die!   But there is this difference--while death brings highest honor   to the soldier at the front, the other who depreciates this   sacrifice shall die in shame.Every judge and every public prosecutor while doing his duty must keepthese words of the Fuehrer in mind. This will enable him to fulfill histask in such a manner as is demanded by the Fuehrer.I beg to give this outline immediately to all judges concerned with theadministration of penal justice and to all public prosecutors, and tobring it to the notice of all judges who will in future be concernedwith the administration of penal justice.

I consider it undesirable that officials of the publicprosecutors office pass on prior to the proceedings such directivesgiven them by a higher authority to the president of the court, asit has been done here. For I am afraid that judges, including thosesitting in the Special Court, are in some cases much more easilyinclined to pronounce a given penalty, especially the death penalty, ifthey hear that the Reich Ministry of Justice has given a directiveto the public prosecutors office to ask for such a sentence or thataccording to the views of the Reich Ministry of Justice this penaltyis necessary. I consider such a communication, given to the court bythe public prosecutor, as undesirable, also because the opinion of theReich Ministry of Justice conveyed by the public prosecutor, mightpossibly, in an individual case, but represent the personal views ofa minor official of the Reich Ministry of Justice, about which he hadinformed the competent official of the public prosecutors office.2. The president of the Berlin district court, according to what hereported to me recently, in the course of a visit to a criminal trialin Moabit observed the following:The trial was set for 0900 hours. Punctually at 0900 the presidentof the district court had taken a seat on the witnesses bench. Thejudges did not show up at first. Instead, loud voices could be heardfrom the conference room behind the courtroom. The president of thedistrict court got the impression of a heated debate in which onevoice could be heard above the others. According to what the presidentof the district court could observe, the defendants attention wasaroused, and he listened in the direction of the conference room. Noactual words could be understood by the president of the districtcourt, but he thought it quite possible that the defendant who wasvery much nearer to the conference room could hear details. Therefore,the president sent a marshal to the conference room with the order toinform the court about that. Shortly afterward the public prosecutorappeared first in the courtroom, then the members of the court. Theyall came through the same door which leads directly to the courtroomfrom the conference room. After the beginning of the proceedings thepresident of the district court soon could undoubtedly recognize thatthe extraordinarily loud voice he had heard before had been the voiceof the public prosecutors representative for that trial.3. Recently I learned from an official complaint[Dienstaufsichtbeschwerde] that immediately prior to the session thepresident of a Special Court had conferred with the public prosecutor.Thereby the punctual beginning of the session was prevented, and thefinal results were that all other people involved in the trial had towait unnecessarily for the beginning of the session. The president ofthe district court told the judge that if such talks seemed necessarythey should be timed in such a way that the punctual beginning of thesession would not be delayed thereby.4. It has been reported to me that repeatedly, even after the beginningof the session, especially after the end of the producing of evidenceand prior to the beginning of the pleadings, the public prosecutorsrepresentative repeatedly got in touch with members of the court in theconference room, during an intermission in the proceedings. In thesetalks, as I have been told, the question of guilt, but above all thesentence, had been discussed.5. I have been informed confidentially that a Gau office for legalaffairs [Gaurechtsamt] has conveyed the following information to theReich Office for Legal Affairs of the NSDAP:   According to a confidential instruction of the Reich Ministry   of Justice, details of which I do not know, the public   prosecutors have been requested to contact the judges about the   sentence to be asked for before the pleadings take place. This   request has caused extraordinary surprise, especially among   lawyers. The pleadings of the defense counsel have practically   become a mere formality. Prior to the pleadings of the defense   counsel the court and the public prosecutor have already agreed   upon the penalty. In practice, the court in almost every   case always agrees to the penalty asked by the Chief Public   Prosecutor.   Naturally, this does not only strike the defense counsel, but   gradually also the population.   In this connection, a change must take place immediately.   If a conference between the public prosecutor and the court   concerning the degree of the penalty is considered necessary at   all, at least it can be asked that the defense counsel, too, be   present at these talks and be permitted to clearly state his   point of view.It is my opinion that, as soon as the trial has begun, any contactsbetween the public prosecutor and members of the court are undesirable,because, as the events discussed above prove, misunderstandings areprovoked thereby.The public prosecutors getting in touch with the court, as requestedin the decree of 27 May 1939--4200. IIIa-4-758, and as it was alsosuggested in the concluding speech of the late Reich Minister ofJustice at the conference held in the Reich Ministry of Justice on 24October 1939 (condensed report, pp. 50 and 51), therefore, will haveto be limited to the time before the beginning of the trial. It seemspractical to have it take place already the day before the trial oreven earlier. At any rate I do not think it desirable that the contactsare made immediately before the beginning of the trial and that, inaddition, they happen in the conference room of the court, because thenoccurrences such as I have described under 2 and 3 of this reportcannot always be prevented. I consider it an illicit contact when thelatter takes place after the end of the producing of evidence or, evenmore, after the pleadings have been concluded. Therefore, the presidentof the district court in Berlin, upon my request, has conferred withthe attorney general of the district court. The latter has instructedthe public prosecutors within his area of jurisdiction to get in touchwith the president of the court--as far as this is necessary--alreadythe day before the trial or still earlier, at any rate, however, torefrain from making contacts after the beginning of the trial. Thepresidents of the courts have been notified by the president of thedistrict court accordingly, and have been instructed to refrain underall circumstances from any getting in contact in the conference roomimmediately prior to the beginning of the session. The prevention orlimitation of discrepancies between the penalty demanded by the publicprosecution and the sentence passed in court, which was the purposeof the decree of 27 May 1939 and of the detailed arguments of thelate Reich Minister of Justice, should be safeguarded by a timely andcomprehensive contact prior to the trial.Moreover, and as stated above, I consider it as undesirable in theinterest of the administration of justice, and in order to remove anyfears concerning influence exerted upon the judges, that officials ofthe public prosecutors office communicate the opinion of the ReichMinistry of Justice in the case on hand, or any orders which may havebeen issued to them concerning the penalties to be asked, to the courtoutside of the proceedings.In view of the general importance of the matter, I thought it advisableto report about it.

The front and thehomeland, the transport system, administration and justice must obeyonly one idea, that of achieving victory. In times like the present, noone can insist on his established rights, but everyone must know thattoday there are only duties._I therefore ask the German Reichstag to confirm expressly that Ihave the legal right to keep everybody to his duty and to cashier orremove from office or position without regard for his person or hisestablished rights, whoever, in my view and according to my consideredopinion, has failed to do his duty._[246] And that just becauseamong millions of decent people, there are only a few exceptions. For,today, one single common duty takes precedence over all rights, eventhe rights of these exceptions. It does not interest me thereforewhether, in the present emergency, leave, etc., can be granted or notto an official or employee in every individual case, and leave whichcannot be granted should not be saved up for a later date._If there is anybody who is entitled to ask for leave, it would befirst of all only our front soldiers and secondly the men and womenworkers who supply the front._For months I have been unable to grant leave to the eastern front, andnobody at home, whatever his office, should dare therefore to insist onhis so-called established right to leave. I myself am justified torefuse because since 1933 I have not taken 3 days leave--a fact whichis probably not known to these individuals._Furthermore, I expect the German legal profession to understandthat the nation is not here for them but that they are here for thenation, that is, the world which includes Germany must not decline inorder that formal law may live, but Germany must live irrespective ofthe contradictions of formal justice._ To quote one example, I failto understand why a criminal who married in 1937, ill-treated his wifeuntil she became insane and finally died as a result of the last act ofill-treatment, should be sentenced to 5 years in a penitentiary at amoment when tens of thousands of honorable German men must die to savethe homeland from annihilation at the hands of bolshevism, that is, toprotect their wives and children._From now on, I shall intervene in these cases and remove from officethose judges who evidently do not understand the demand of the hour._The achievements and sacrifices of the German soldier, the Germanworker, the farmer, our women in town and country, that is, themillions of our middle classes, imbued only with the idea of victory,demand the corresponding attitude on the part of those who themselveshave been called by the people to protect their interests. In timeslike the present there can be no sacrosanct individual with establishedrights but all of us are merely obedient servants of the nation.Deputies!Men of the Reichstag!A tremendous winter battle is behind us. The hour will strike whenthe fronts will come out of their rigidity, and then history willdecide who was victorious in this winter--the aggressor who insanelysacrificed his masses or the defender who simply held his position.During the past few weeks I have read continuously about the violentthreats of our enemies.

A Letter from Schlegelberger to Hitler, Enclosing a Proposed Decree                        for Hitlers SignatureThe Acting Reich Minister of Justice                                                   Berlin, 6 May 1942My Fuehrer!Repeatedly, and finally in the session of the Greater German Reichstagon the 26 April of this year, you expressed that the front and thehomeland require the unrelenting punishment of criminals, and that thejudgments of the courts which do not meet these requirements cannot betolerated.[248]In order to accelerate the setting aside of such decisions, you, myFuehrer, created the extraordinary objection to the Reich SupremeCourt.[249] With the help of this legal resource the judgment againstSchlitt, which you mentioned in the session of the Reichstag, wasquashed within 10 days by sentence of the Reich Supreme Court. Schlittwas sentenced to death and executed at once. I believe, however, thatthe desired aim could be achieved even better and quicker if the ReichMinister of Justice, by means of an authority of confirmation, weregiven decisive influence on the award of punishment.If you, my Fuehrer, could decide, by signing the attached draft of adecree, to transfer to the Reich Minister of Justice this right ofconfirmation for cases in which you do not want to decide yourself, thefollowing would be achieved thereby:The entire administration of penal justice be placed under thesupreme control of the Reich Minister of Justice as far as the awardof punishment is concerned. He could then achieve an increase ofinsufficient punishment in every case.The Reich Minister of Justice would pronounce the nonconfirmationeither himself or, more probably, in view of the approximately 300,000penal sentences per annum, through the presidents of the courts ofappeal.In case of a nonconfirmation, the president of the court of appealwould himself fix the punishment or bring about another judicialdecision on the measure of punishment.The Reich Minister of Justice could, as soon as it is obvious that acriminal court cannot master a case, transfer the matter to anothercourt.It is guaranteed that the Reich Minister of Justice will immediately beinformed about all important criminal matters. The attorneys generalwho, according to the draft, would have to propose the nonconfirmation,are under his direction. I can absolutely rely on the insight andwillingness to serve of the 35 presidents of the courts of appeal.Should they ever lack the necessary severity, I myself would pronouncethe nonconfirmation.Therefore I believe that, if you, my Fuehrer, will agree to the draft,I could assume the responsibility that the punishment awards of thecourts will no longer lead to complaints.                                                 Heil, my Fuehrer!                                          [Signed] DR. SCHLEGELBERGER[Draft]    Decree by the Fuehrer on the authority for Confirmation in    Criminal cases of                             1942.                                   IAs far as I shall not decide myself, in my capacity as holder of thesupreme judicial power, I charge the Reich Minister of Justice toregulate within his jurisdiction the confirmation of sentences passedby special courts and other penal courts. In this connection thefollowing is ordered:                                  III authorize the Reich Minister of Justice to pass on to the presidentsof the courts of appeal the right to refuse confirmation to the amountof penalty following a valid judgment upon application of the generalprosecutor in as much as such nonconfirmation of the sentence is notpronounced by the Reich Minister of Justice himself.                                  IIIIn case the president of the court of appeal denies confirmation ofthe sentence, he will return the case to the same or another court foranother award of penalty. In case it was wrongly denied or disregardedthat the culprit was a peoples parasite [Volksschaedling], brutalcriminal, dangerous professional criminal or a dangerous immoralcriminal, he is also entitled to quash the sentence for award of a justpenalty and to pass the case to the same or another court for a newtrial and judgment.                                  IVUpon demand of the general prosecutor, the president of the court ofappeal, by calling in two judges as advisers, can also commute thesentence in free procedure himself.                                   VThe court to which the president of the court of appeal has passedon the case will, with the aid of the prosecutor, decide by writ orjudgment in a proceeding that will be freely determined by itself.                                  VIIn case of urgent reasons dictated by public interest, the ReichMinister of Justice can pass a pending trial on to another court withinhis jurisdiction.                                  VIIThe Reich Minister of Justice, in accordance with the Reich Ministerand chief of the Reich Chancellery and the head of the PartyChancellery, is entitled to issue instructions for the execution ofthis decree.                                                                 1942                                                    THE FUEHRER         The Reich Minister and Chief of the Reich Chancellery  2.

It seems to me indeed the only andsafe way to master insufficient punishment in legal sentences.The Fuehrer agreed to the decree in principle but could not decide onsigning it; moreover, suggested whether it was not appropriate to soonfill in the position of Reich Minister of Justice and to leave thereform in question as well as the other reforms also to the new ReichMinister of Justice.3. Under Secretary Dr. Schlegelberger, who visited me here, has beenbriefly informed by me on 8th instant about the state of the affair.He told me that he had already interested the Reich Marshal [Goering]also in the draft of the decree, and that he [the Reich Marshal] hadpromised him to speak in favor of the decree.Under Secretary Dr. Schlegelberger further stressed the fact that thedecree would naturally lose all its value for him if the confirmatoryauthority would pass to party offices (Party Chancellery, Gauleiter).To that I replied that one could perhaps consider to listen to theparty before using the confirmatory authority. With regard to thisquestion on 9th instant, Under Secretary Schlegelberger presented thenotes of the same day to me. (Rk. 6833 B). He promised me also to sendmore material to the case in hand.4.

H. LammersBerlin W 86 Voss-StrasseSubject: Draft of a Fuehrer decree concerning the authority for           confirmation [of sentences] in criminal casesReference: Your letter dated 21 May 1942--Reich Chancellery             7010 B.Dear Dr. Lammers:During the session of the Reichstag held on 26 April 1942, the Fuehrerrequested the Greater German Reichstag expressly in considerationof the exigencies of the war, for the authorization to take allmeasures he deemed expedient without being bound by the existing legalprovisions.[251] The Fuehrers choice of [expressing his desire] thisway shows the importance he imputes to sovereign acts of the State[Hoheitsakten]. It is not proper to limit pronounced sentences--whichhave a certain effect on legal affairs--in their guiding effect onlegal and factual circumstances by questioning their irrevocabilitythrough further unpredictable interventions, after all lawfullyprovided legal resources have been exhausted. This applies to a specialdegree to the judgments of courts which, in every case, represent aconsiderable intervention into the personal conditions of the peopleinvolved and, moreover, have a certain effect on the entire nation,be it as an intimidation or as a satisfaction with the strong,order-establishing hand of the State. Moreover, the arrangement ofthe life of the people requires that the further development of legalconditions starts from certain fixed basic conditions which cannot beshaken from any side, and that the security of the law be guaranteed.If the Fuehrer expressly requested the right of direct interventionover all formal legal provisions, then this emphasizes particularly theimportance of the modification of a judicial sentence.The proposal made by the Reich Minister of Justice, however, is likelyto obliterate the impression of this authorization, and to impair itsimportance. However, this would be an inevitable consequence of thetransfer of the correcting authority to the presidents of the courtof appeal and of the strong decentralization originating thereby. Theproposed decree of the Fuehrer would be nothing more than anothereffort to correct insufficient sentences as has been repeatedlyundertaken before by the Reich Justice Ministry. In addition to theanalogy provision of article 2 of the Reich criminal (penal) Code, I amespecially thinking of the extraordinary objection, the nullity plea,the participation of the public prosecutor in civil proceedings, thepublic parasite decree, the decree against desperate criminals, andthe provisions concerning dangerous professional criminals and immoralcriminals.[handwritten] Justiz 3Despite all these provisions we were not in the position to silence thecomplaints on judgment inadequate in consideration of the exigenciesof war. We observed again and again how these provisions were appliedas mildly as possible, and not at all with the required readiness forresponsibility and strictness which actually would have been possible.It is my conviction that the proposed decree of the Fuehrer willhave the same fate as the measures whose execution remained with theadministration of justice.It must be expected that the presidents of the courts of appeal willshrink from an intervention into the independence of the judge,of which they still have the old conception. They will bring thejudge concerned on to the right path, not so much guided by theirown conviction, but in order to get him to pass a sentence whichwill satisfy the threatening criticism. Even less, however, can oneexpect, for the same reason, more rigorously enhanced measures againstan obstinate or incapable judge. Therefore, we must not expect theelucidating and guiding decisions hoped for in the material andpersonal field, the value of which lies first of all in the educationalinfluence on other judges and on the public, but only measures orindications limited to individual cases.In a formal respect, the following misgiving should be stressed: Withthe wording provided under paragraphs I and II of the draft, theFuehrer literally deprives himself to a vast extent of the right ofcorrecting sentences. In all cases which are brought to the Fuehrersknowledge only after the president of the court of appeal or theMinister of Justice has decided on the confirmation of a sentence,this decision was taken by order of the Fuehrer. Even with regardto the authorization by the Reichstag there would not be any room forthe Fuehrers decision, since by the proposed decree he would haverenounced the authorization legally assigned to him, in favor of theMinister of Justice or even of the president of the court of appeal.Because of these considerations I am not able to agree with the draftof a Fuehrer decree as suggested by Under Secretary Schlegelberger.In view of the importance which I assign to these fundamentalobjections, I have refrained for the time being from showing theadditional objections I have to the structure of the decree and itsindividual provisions.

If the judges read the correction inthe bulletin of the Reich chamber of attorneys of 20 May 1941 and thensee there is no vindication of the judges to the public, a furtherincrease of the displeasure among the German judges can scarcely beimagined.                                  III was confidentially informed of the draft of the law of April 1941concerning the treatment of asocial elements.[253] According to thislaw the custody of these persons is exclusively in the hands of theReich Security Main Office, and so the sterilization insofar as thedecision of this office as to whether a person is asocial has beendeclared binding on the eugenics court. I consider so extensive adisregarding of a judicial authority very dubious, and I propose thatthe local court consisting perhaps of a judge, a physician, and arepresentative of the police should decide whether an asocial elementshould be kept in lifelong custody or should be sterilized.                                  IIIDay before yesterday I undertook a careful review of the courts ofBremen, and I learned anew that there is in Bremen a complete lack ofsuitable younger men to become judges. One of the reasons for thislack was the fact that the customary manner in which lawyers hadhitherto applied for the judicial career has been made impossiblebecause only up to 4 years of their activity as attorneys may beincluded in their service age for purposes of calculating salaries. Asthe Finance Minister has agreed, for the annexed eastern territories,three-quarters of the period of service as an attorney may be addedto the service age for purposes of calculating salaries. I proposethat this provision shall also be issued for Bremen, because of thespecial circumstances. In view of the whole development of the judicialsituation in Bremen, I should consider it very regrettable if theBremen lawyers were deprived of the opportunity of becoming judges.

The Fuehrers speech at the meeting of the Reichstag on 26 April1942 has, as far as the administration of justice is concerned,caused alarm among the judges of my district. Uncertainty in theadministration of justice was threatening, since the Fuehrersreproaches--except in the Oldenburg case, particulars of which were,however, not given either--were held in general terms, and the questionon what reasons the Fuehrer based his reproaches could not be answered.As soon as possible, I called together the judges of the court ofappeal and informed them, and through the presidents of the districtcourts, the judges of their courts, and of the local courts that I,too, did not know the reasons for the Fuehrers reproaches, but thatit was the duty of all of us to examine ourselves earnestly as to theextent to which he was to blame; the judges were to continue to dotheir duty and were to hold themselves responsible to the Fuehrer andto their own conscience; the sentences passed by the courts of thisdistrict have always been severe, except for some cases, and thisstandard should be kept up in the future. It has been reported to methat my words have had a calming effect; the administration of justicein this district continues to proceed along the proper lines, andaccording to my observations the standards of sentences have remainedthe same.Among the population, the Fuehrers critical remarks about theadministration of justice have given rise to spitefulness as well asto sympathy for the profession of the judges. At the moment the matteris hardly talked about, but it has not been forgotten. Above all, itis painful for the judges that the number of persons is increasing whodo not believe that the judges pass unbiased sentences. In my opinion,endeavors must be made to restore the confidence of the people in theunprejudiced administration of justice. At any rate all things haveto be avoided which could further that impression. I have asked theattorney general to take measures to prevent the sentence demanded bythe prosecution from leaking out previously. It is quite natural thatif it becomes known before the trial that the prosecutor will demandthe death sentence with the approval of the Ministry of Justice, itwill easily be believed that the judges are prejudiced.According to my observations, information about the sentence whichthe prosecutor will propose with the approval of the Reich Ministryof Justice, is disturbing to the judges, even if mentioned only inthe course of conversation, which is understandable on account ofthe authority of the Ministry of Justice and the position of thejudges. Even old, experienced judges find their unprejudiced stateof mind upset. But according to my observations, the judges areabsolutely ready to accept general directives and to follow them in theadministration of justice. Therefore, I think it highly desirable thatthe directives which are issued at the conferences of the presidentsof the courts of appeal in the Reich Ministry of Justice as well asthose given some days ago at the meeting of the attorneys general inthe Reich Ministry of Justice should be submitted in writing to thepresidents of the courts of appeal for the information of the judges. Ithink this will greatly assist the administration of justice.2. The number of death sentences passed within the area of this courtof appeal shows the following development. There were--    1940                       27 death sentences.    1941                       52 death sentences.    1942 (first 6 months)      45 death sentences.The increase is due to wartime conditions and to the extension of thesphere of the death sentence by the law of 4 September 1941. Of thedeath sentences passed this year, 6 were passed for offenses againstwar economy, 10 for sexual offenses, 8 for crimes of violence, and 20for theft.On an average, 5 to 6 weeks elapse between the pronouncing of thesentence and the execution.3. Since last May, police officials have appeared frequently in thecriminal court in order to report to their superior office aboutthe proceedings. The president of the district court at Dortmund hasreported the following cases to me:   (1) In the middle of May 1942, a habitual criminal was   tried before the criminal court and was sentenced to death.   A Kriminalsecretaer [detective] of the local criminal police   attended the trial as an observer. He told the president   himself, and expressly pointed out during the trial, that the   Reich criminal police office had instructed him by teletype to   attend. I heard that this criminal police official telephoned   the prosecuting attorney before the trial and told him that   he could imagine why he had been sent. The official had a   conversation with the prosecutor during the deliberation of the   court. During this conversation he declared that the police   would have no reason to take action if an order for security   detention would be made. He indicated that his presence was   connected with the speech of the Fuehrer. I have neither spoken   to the prosecutor nor have I had any reason to ask for a written   statement. For the president who informed me vouches for the   truth.   (2) At the end of May, a trial was held before the criminal   court against another criminal who was condemned to death. An   official of the criminal police was summoned as a witness.   Before the opening of the trial this official submitted to   the court a letter from the Reich criminal police office, in   which the local police authorities were requested to inform   that office of the result of the trial--especially whether the   demand for the death penalty, which was to be expected, had been   complied with--and of the mitigating circumstances mentioned   in the courts findings in the event that a punishment other   than the death penalty be awarded. Unfortunately, the president   failed to take note of the exact contents of the letter. The   official attended the proceedings after having been interrogated   in the witness box.   (3) At another trial held before the criminal court, at which   the death sentence had been demanded but was not passed, a   criminal police officer who had been summoned as a witness took   the courts findings down on a sheet of paper.   (4) An SS member in uniform, holding the rank of a sergeant,   attended a trial before the Special Court in which, among other   persons, the wife of a Landrat was involved. He asked for   permission to be present at the hearing and said that he was   coming from _Kassel_ on behalf of a police or security   authority.   (5) An official of intermediate rank of the local secret State   police office participated as observer at another out-of-town   trial of the Special Court lasting several days. No further   details are known.   (6) A detective from Bochum participated as witness at   the trial of a juvenile perpetrator by the Special Court   in Bochum. He compared the penalty imposed by the Special   Court with another penalty--a term of imprisonment for many   years--allegedly imposed the day before by the penal chamber at   Bochum upon a juvenile perpetrator (because of poisoning?). On   this occasion he remarked, with regard to the sentence handed   down by the penal chamber, that the police had but to examine   whether there was a motive, in order to interfere. This remark   was made after the trial.4. As the attorney general has already reported to the Reich Ministryof Justice, the Secret State Police recently did not commit twocivilian workers from the Ukraine who had shot a forest keeper in theDortmund district court area to the court for prosecution, althoughthe court had issued a warrant for arrest and the Special Court wasprepared for an immediate conviction. They were hanged later on bythe secret State Police. Furthermore, it was reported to me by thelocal court at Haltern that on 19 June 1942 a Polish laborer washanged in its district by the police because he was said to havehad sexual intercourse with a German woman. I enclose a copy of thereport dated 29 June 1942. If the rumors are true that the Fuehrerhas transferred capital jurisdiction to the police to this extent, itwould be desirable to inform the judges and public prosecutors of thisarrangement through official channels, as it is assumed that the policeare engaged in unauthorized and unlawful activity. Publications in thedaily newspapers give the impression that these were executions ofsentences which had been legally imposed.5. The office of racial policy [Rassenpolitische Amt] of the NSDAPissued a treatise on National Socialistic policy with regard toforeigners for official use by the Party of which I receivedconfidential information. It contains regulations for marriages betweenGermans and members of other nations which are of importance withregard to the exemptions of foreigners from the marriage clearancecertificates which are subject to the approval of the presidents ofthe courts of appeal. I propose to ask the office of racial policyto submit this treatise to all presidents of the courts of appeal.Applications for exemptions from marriage clearance certificates haveassumed large proportions within my district. The procedure which Ihave adopted is in accordance with the principles of the treatisepolicy with regard to foreigners.6. The district of this court of appeal has been very disturbed byair-raid alarms at night during recent months, until about two weeksago. Air raids occur only occasionally now, keeping within moderatelimits. In a number of places the Wehrmacht has started employing maleinhabitants to replace the antiaircraft personnel. Older age groupshave been trained for this purpose in daily courses from 1900 till 2200hours. 15 officials and employees of the court of appeal have beendetailed for this.                                              [Signed] SCHNEIDER    TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT NG-417    PROSECUTION EXHIBIT 23        SUMMARY BY DR. CROHNE OF THE REICH MINISTRY OF JUSTICE           CONCERNING GOEBBELS SPEECH TO THE MEMBERS OF THE                     PEOPLES COURT, 22 JULY 1942    _Report on the Speech of Reich Minister Dr. Goebbels before the            Members of the Peoples Court on 22 July 1942_Reich Minister Dr. Goebbels stated at the outset that he had been askedby President Thierack to address the members of the highest Germancourt of justice. He had gladly complied with this request. What he hadto say had a special political aspect owing to the Fuehrers approvalof his comments, the draft of which he had submitted to the Fuehrer.The civil servants of the administration of justice had, owing to thenature of their work, always been subject to public criticism. Alsotoday decisions of the courts were criticized and called alien tothe spirit of the German people. One must not reply to the reproachthat justice had failed by protesting that always only certain casesof wrong decisions had been singled out and the great number of thegood and correct judgments had been disregarded. We are dealing herewith a principle, i.e., of a wrong attitude of many judges who couldnot redeem themselves from their old ways of thinking. The one-sidedteaching at the universities is to be blamed for it to a considerableextent and also the fact that the judge lived secluded in hisprofessional surroundings and knew too little of life itself. Decisionsalien to the spirit of the German people had, however, very detrimentaleffects especially during wartime. All must be done to remedy thesituation before it is too late for the administration of justice. Noprofessional men except the judges had heretofore had the guaranty ofbeing irremovable. Even generals could be removed. A powerful statecould not renounce the right to remove officers unsuitable for theiroffice because of inaptness or other reasons. This had to apply to thejudge as well. The idea of the irremovable judges he went on to say,originated in an alien intellectual world, hostile to the German people.The Minister then referred to individual judgments that nowadayswere unbearable. He cited in the first instance the case of the JewLeo Sklarek. (In the Ministers speech stated by error is the caseof Barmat.) He could not understand that this notorious Jewishprofiteer, who after his emigration to Prague had been a spy, hadonly been sentenced to 8 years penitentiary (the judgment of thePeoples Court of justice of 16 April 1942 was delivered for havingincited to commit high treason, based on paragraph 92 of the PenalCode). The judgment which the court of Eichstaedt had delivered, inthe case of a man killed in action in the East having been insulted,was also untenable. A woman upon receipt of the news of his death whohad uttered, Thank God, had been acquitted by reason of impossiblejustification. The Minister also referred to Moelders letter.While making his decisions the judge had to proceed less from thelaw than from the basic idea that the offender was to be eliminatedfrom the community. During a war, it was not so much a matter ofwhether a judgment was just or unjust but only whether the decisionwas expedient. The State must ward off its internal foes in the mostefficient way and wipe them out entirely. The idea that the judge mustbe convinced of the defendants guilt must be discarded completely. Thepurpose of the administration of the law was not in the first placeretaliation or even improvement but maintenance of the State. One mustnot proceed from the law, but from the resolution that the man mustbe wiped out. The criminal must know beforehand that he will lose hishead, should he assault the foundations of the State. These drasticmeasures must not be left to offices outside of justice but are theduty of justice. The big sacrifices of life which must be made by thebest part of the people during the war give us a special reason totreat the offender with all ruthlessness. We must bear in mind thatduring the winter 19411942 every criminal had better billets in theprisons than 3 million German soldiers. Today we have an entirelydifferent conception of certain offenses which in normal times wouldnot have been considered serious at all, but are now regarded asdeserving death penalty; (theft during an air-raid alarm, robberyof handbags during black-out hours, and heavy penalties in casesof listening to foreign wireless stations this action being mentalself-mutilation). Justice ridiculed itself by placarding summons tomissing persons prior to their being pronounced dead, as everybody knewthe missing person in the East or even in any enemys country could notreport at all.In this connection the Minister went on to speak about the Jewishproblem. He went on to say that if still more than 40,000 Jews whom weconsider enemies of the State could freely go about in Berlin, this wassolely due to the lack of sufficient means of transportation. Otherwisethe Jews would have been in the East long ago. The officers of justicemust recognize their political task also while attending to theJews. To feel sorry for them would be a blunder. It was an untenablesituation that still today a Jew could protest against the charge ofa president of the police who was an old Party member and a high SSleader. The Jew should not be granted any legal remedy at all nor anyright of protest.In his final comments the Minister pointed out again that the Statemust apply all means to ward off its foes at home and abroad. During awar it was therefore necessary that the idea of the expedient decisiontook the first place in justice. The people had to be possessed withthe will of absolute self-maintenance. He recalled the words whichthe Fuehrer had said on 30 January 1933 to him on their way fromthe Kaiserhof to the Chancellery of the Reich upon entering thechancellery, Nobody will ever get me out of here alive.[254]After this speech President Thierack expressed his thanks to theMinister for his fundamental comments and said that the Minister hadgreatly assisted him once before and asked him to repeat his inspiringand directing instructions also in future.

This controlconsisted in an extensive participation of the Ministry and of thesupervising judicial officials, and presidents of the district courtsof appeal and of the district courts in the sentencing-activity ofthe individual criminal judge on the principle that, especially incriminal cases with a political implication, the judge must receiveassistance when pronouncing a sentence. Actually, it involved then asubstantial extension of the already existing consultative obligationsof the public prosecutor to the Ministry and, on the other hand, theintroduction of a consultative obligation in the relations of thecourts to the Ministry as well. According to numerous reports fromthe whole territory of the Reich, these measures have met with anextremely _dissentient reception among juridical circles_. Thecomplete break with the hitherto prevailing conception of judicialindependence which the control of penal jurisdiction means, is saidto have been, to a certain extent, very unfavorably commented uponwithin the judiciary. In certain cases, this is even said to have ledto outspoken expressions of opinion against the National SocialistState which allegedly wished to suppress judicial independence inorder to surrender justice to a right of control by political offices.The origin of this attitude on the part of certain judges in thisrespect is always the conventional conception of judicial independenceaccording to which the judge was exclusively subordinated to thewritten law and therefore did not need to follow any directives even ofthe most general character, that may be issued by the administration ofjustice with reference to any precise line of conduct in jurisdiction._Politically enlightened judges have_ likewise, according to thereports, viewed _the control of jurisdiction with misgivings_.In this, they have indeed not so much perceived a danger to judicialindependence, for it was clear to them that its implication up to now,namely, exclusive subordination of the judge to the law, has beendeeply altered to suit the National Socialist juridical philosophy, asin the fact that the obligations to the National Socialist ideologymust have precedence over the obligations to the law if jurisdictionwas not to be in opposition to the political objectives of the nationsleadership. Since the execution of law in the National Socialist Statehas important _political_ tasks to fulfill, a certain influenceon the judges must be made possible in the form of instruction onimportant political viewpoints which the individual judge cannot graspoutright by himself.As reported, however, these judges have likewise given an unfavorablereception to the method of control of penal jurisdiction, for itamounts only to an attempt with inadequate means to solve from awrongly selected principle _the_ very problem posed to theadministration of jurisdiction, namely _the uniform political andideological_ adjustment of the judge.The intention of the administration of justice to gain influenceon legal jurisdiction through the channel of the Ministry and thepresidents of the district courts of appeal and of the district courtswas therefore doomed to failure. The indispensable prerequisite forthe possible success of such a gain of influence would have been thatthe officials exercising the control base their action on a unifiedpolitical principle. As shown by experience, however, this has by nomeans been the case.On the whole, the objective pursued by the leaders, who have beenat the head of the Reich Ministry of Justice so far, in introducingthe control of jurisdiction in order _to reduce_ the far fromnegligible number of _wrong sentences, can only be reached undercertain conditions_. Indeed certain sources of error have beenremoved with great difficulty. Without active handling of the basicproblem of the political and ideological adjustment of the judiciaryitself, a real improvement [Gesundung] of the execution of law cannotbe expected in the long run.The following example extracted from a series of similar cases ischaracteristic of the situation created by the introduction of thecontrol of jurisdiction.Roaming about at night at his place of domicile for several months, aPolish civilian workman stole from gardens and dwelling places money,numerous articles of underwear and clothing, as well as other articlesof daily utility. As the competent special court established, he hadcarried this out under cover of the black-out.In line with provisions, introducing reporting as a duty, the presidentof the competent district court of appeal had brought the case bytelephone to the knowledge of the Reich Ministry of Justice. In itsreply to the telephone message the Ministry advised the following daythat the death penalty would probably not be deemed necessary for thePole. That in any case the public prosecutor would receive explicitinstruction before opening of the court hearing as to the penalty whichshould be asked against the Pole. The Ministry thereupon instructed thepublic prosecutor to propose 10 years of particularly rigid confinementin a place of detention. The court ruled accordingly.As reported, the hypotheses under which this verdict took place, aswell as the degree of the sentence itself, met with lively criticismon the part of politically awake lawyers. On the one hand it causedconcern that by the direction of the administration of justice insuch a manner the judge might from the outset be relieved of personalresponsibility for his verdict. In as much as in a very great numberof cases it becomes known to the court that the public prosecutor isbeing supplied with instructions regarding the application in criminalproceedings, it merely needs to comply with the request of the publicprosecutor, thereby evading embarrassment which might possibly resultfrom mistrials through reference to the concept of the Ministry. Onthe other hand, the case as described illustrates that the successof such a control stands and falls with the persons to whom suchcontrol is entrusted. If confusion prevails in the Ministry itselfas to the line which the administration of justice should follow inregard to the Pole, there naturally is no guaranty that mistrials areexcluded through the concept of control. The verdict in the case underconsideration must be considered a faulty judgment; because underprevailing conditions there is no justification for the leniency whichit expresses on behalf of a Pole who commits crimes under the cover ofthe black-out.In connection with this and a series of similar cases reports of judgeswhom this development fills with serious concern stressed over andover again the _need_ for informing the _judiciary about thegreat goals of the leaders of the State_. At the present time thereis but a comparatively small number of judges who make an earnestendeavor to analyze the State political necessities as such, and thepolitical foundation of the administration of justice. Unfortunately,it has so far been a fact that any civil servant in the administrationwho has just passed his second state examination in law has been morefully informed about the political goals of the State leaders and thepolitical opportuneness than perhaps any president of a senate.Also, this circumstance should be recognized as an important reasonfor the failure so far experienced in the administration of justice.Consequently, there exists a greater need than ever for bringing thejudges much closer to the problems of State leadership and of Statenecessities as they arise newly all the time due to the war.In the opinion of others, the former heads of the Reich Ministry ofJustice likewise failed to fully realize their intent of remedying thelack of judgment of some judges in the case of decisions on penal caseswith political aspects by controlling the administration of justice. Itwas said that in meetings held in the Ministry, the presidents of thedistrict courts of appeal had been instructed to explain in officialmeetings to the judges under their jurisdiction how serious thesituation is which is now encountered in the administration of justice,and in that connection to discuss examples for faulty verdicts, amongother things also dealing with such which the Fuehrer himself hascriticized. Some of the presidents of the district courts of appealand of the district courts had discharged this task in such a mannerthat they manifestly refrained from expressing an opinion of their own,thereby making known that they themselves held a different opinion.This led to increased insecurity on the part of many judges.An extension of report requirements yielded in some districts resultsalong similar lines. It was partly made compulsory for judges at localcourts, for example, to report every case of even moderate import tothe president of the district court who on his part passed it on to thepresident of the district court of appeal and he to the Ministry. Insome districts every judge at the local court was held to make a reporteach session on all cases which had come up. According to anotherreport all judges of a district court of appeal had met to consult on averdict which a judge of the local court was about to pronounce.Going by the Fuehrers criticism of some individual verdicts, theMinistry occasionally makes reference as to the Fuehrers opinion inprinciple--so it is reported--in regard to certain delinquencies,urging upon the presidents of the district courts of appeal to acquainttheir judges with the Fuehrers attitude as it more or less was assumedto be. This, too, resulted, in part, in completely confusing theconcepts of the judges. To cite an example, a verdict was discussed ata meeting of the presidents of the district courts of appeal held inthe Reich Ministry of Justice, according to which a woman, whose childhad fallen into a vessel of hot water while playing and scalded itselffatally, had been sentenced to 6 weeks of imprisonment. The Fuehrercriticized that case because the loss of the child was hard enougha punishment for the mother and that, therefore, court proceedingsreflected the concept of justice in form but were not in harmony withthe natural concept of justice. When this case was passed on by thepresidents of the district courts of appeal and of the district courtsto the court judges, it was, in part, understood to mean that _inprinciple_ it was the Fuehrers intent that women should be punishedvery mildly only.The following case is cited as an illustration of the practical resultof an interpretation of the Fuehrers will along such lines.--A womanhad planned to give to the judge, who was considering a civil complaintmade by her, a parcel with foodstuffs, a few days before the casecame up in court for a hearing. Thereupon, the judge initiated courtaction against her because of an active attempt to bribe a judge.Bearing in mind the purported will of the Fuehrer that mild sentencesshould be imposed upon women and using such will as justification, theinstruction was given that the woman was not to be punished at all.Only at a later date was this instruction modified in that it was ruledthat a small fine was to be paid.In connection with these and similar cases it is reported that it is avery doubtful principle to bring to the knowledge of the judges what ismerely the purported or assumed will of the Fuehrer. Naturally this isbound to lead to constant conflicts for the judge. Considering thingsfrom all angles it is evident from the numerous reports which havecome to hand that the so-called _directing of the administrationof justice_ met with but a _limited amount of the success_at which it had aimed. Aside from the numerous doubts which arise asa matter of principle, _the amount of work involved to make thisdirecting practically possible is not commensurate with results sofar achieved_. Compulsory reporting, which met with a considerableamount of criticism by the public prosecution even before introductionof the directing policy, has been considerably increased after theintroduction of the directing policy and now extends even to thepresidents of the district courts of appeal and of the district courts.This is said to have brought about a very considerable delay andburden in work which can neither be reconciled with the simplificationand acceleration nor with the number of personnel at this time stillavailable to the judiciary. Over and above this, the duty to submitreports has considerably paralyzed the power of decision and readinessto assume responsibility on the part of the judges, in as much as inmany instances they are relieved of responsibility by other instances,as a result of which they feel to have been deprived of their essentialtask as judges.                    EXTRACTS FROM THE TESTIMONY OF                     DEFENDANT SCHLEGELBERGER[256]_DIRECT EXAMINATION_       *       *       *       *       *       *       *DR. KUBUSCHOK (counsel for defendant Schlegelberger): I am nowstarting on a new group of questions. Do you wish me to start on itbefore the recess?The prosecution charges you with directing the administration of penallaw through the Reich Ministry of Justice. Please state your views.DEFENDANT SCHLEGELBERGER: Concerning these questions, we mustdifferentiate between the position of the public prosecutor and that ofthe judge. The public prosecutor is an administrative agency dependentupon the instructions from his superior agencies. The judge isresponsible merely to the law and his own conscience and judgment. Thequestion to what extent and under what prerequisites the prosecutor hasto report to his superior agency has been laid down in administrativeregulations. The more important the individual question, the higher theagency the opinion of which is requested. It has therefore always beena matter of course that the importance of penal cases according to thecase itself, or according to the punishment which is to be expected,has to be reported to the higher authority. I notice the suggestionwas approved and an instruction was issued, an instruction which asfar as it concerned a matter which was being dealt with at the trialalways had to be interpreted in such a way that in the last analysisthe public prosecutor had to make his decision dependent on the courseof the trial. In 1939 Guertner--I myself had no part in these mattersat the time and I dont know what part Freisler played--pointed outto the public prosecutor that they should see to it that a greatdifference between the demand for a sentence of the prosecution and theactual sentence pronounced by the judge be avoided.                               [Recess]Q. Witness, we were discussing the guidance of the administration ofcriminal justice. Please continue with your explanation.A. Before the recess I had referred to a decree by Guertner whichrequired a constant connection with the courts in order to avoid adiscrepancy between the plea of the prosecution and the final verdict.May I continue on this point?I should like to assume that this decree or this order finds itsdefinite reason in the fact that at that time a large number of newlaws had been promulgated for which precedence in sentences did notexist and could not exist. Only gradually it was possible, with regardto these laws, to form a firm foundation based upon sentences andopinions of the supreme judicial authority. Frequently, therefore,surprises occurred if the prosecution in applying the law had adefinitely different position from the opinion of the Tribunal. Thepurpose of that decree was to avoid this ambiguity as far as possible,and to reduce these differences to the least possible measure, alsoconcerning the extent of punishment, which depended on the findingsof the court. That quite apparently, as a matter of course, couldonly be achieved by a conference before the trial. The reportssubmitted by the prosecution, by the president of the Kammergerichton 3 January 1942, and from the same year by the president of thedistrict court of appeals at Hamm, revealed that some misuse had takenplace. It is stated there that the prosecutor after the presentationof evidence--that is to say, during the proceedings--had pointed outto the court what sentence with the approval of the Ministry he woulddemand, and in so doing created the opinion in the court that heexpected that sentence and that penalty.From this report can be seen that the presidents of the districtcourts of appeal quite rightly considered this behavior a misuse. Thereport by the president of the Kammergericht I had not seen until now.I do not know what steps were taken after that report was receivedby Freisler. Maybe this is a case again, one of these cases, whereimportant matters had been neglected by him.The report from the president of the district court of appeal at HammI remember very clearly. I had made up my mind to put this matter onthe agenda of the next meeting of the presidents of the district courtsof appeal. These meetings had the express purpose to discuss suchquestions which had been raised in the reports. Owing to the fact thatI left my office soon thereafter, there was no longer any opportunityfor me to carry out these intentions.Q. The two reports you mentioned were submitted by the prosecutionas Document NG-445, Prosecution Exhibit 73 and Document NG-395,Prosecution Exhibit 74 with the Documents NG-505 and 508, Exhibits 71and 72.[257] The prosecution also charges you with having influencedthe jurisdiction of the judges. I ask you to state your position withregard to these documents.A. In the course of the examination today I was compelled on variousoccasions to explain to what degree the Party intended and tried towrest various fields from the administration of justice and turnthese competencies over to the police. In July 1941 that question wasespecially acute because there was an attempt to take away from theadministration the prosecution of Jews and Poles. The opposition basedits arguments on sentences which revealed a certain ignorance on thepart of the judges of conditions of actual life. Under any form ofgovernment one has heard complaints about the fact that the judges werefar removed from the facts and experiences of daily life. In the oldReichstag there was hardly any debate on matters of justice withoutthese complaints, and such complaints naturally coming up during thewar and in the course of many events the complete changes of allconditions of life and national economy found plenty of nourishment.It was the duty of the central agency to acquaint the judges with suchgeneral points of view and to demonstrate to them what the influence oftemporary conditions and recent conditions would have to be upon thepolicy of criminal law. Apart from that, one had to be vigilant againstthat danger which I have described, namely, that certain fields of theadministration of justice could be wrested from them.At that time sex crimes of Poles were very frequent. The reason forthat could possibly have been that these laborers who had been broughtinto Germany, in many cases, came into a living community with thefamilies of the employers, that the husbands were usually at the front,and that the Poles themselves, that is, the greater part of the Polesthemselves were in Germany without their families. The ground for sexoffenses, therefore, was conditioned by these elements, and some judgesdid not recognize that.In the documents submitted by the prosecution one case is mentionedwhich was tried before the Penal Chamber Lueneburg. It is the caseof a sex crime committed by a Polish agricultural laborer. Thatdefendant was granted extenuating circumstances, because, and Iquote, He did not have the same restraint toward female co-workersas a German agricultural worker would. That opinion apparently wasuntenable. The Reich Supreme Court sharply rejected it. It was alsovery dangerous at the same time, because if reasons of that kind hadbecome known to Hitler there would have arisen a new grave danger tothe entire administration of justice. Therefore, I saw cause to find adifferent job for this judge who apparently was not aware of prevailingconditions. Cases of this nature and many others which may not havebeen quite as wrong but could have made a certain impression gave causeand reason for a type of propaganda which promised a great deal ofsuccess and that made me write that letter of 24 July 1941 to the courtauthorities in the provinces where I pointed out that in the casesof definitely criminal elements a sexual crime as a rule should beconsidered according to the legal provisions and regulations as a crimeto be punished with death. The actual documentary background for thatletter is to be found in the document of the prosecution. Therefromone can see in what cases the police may have corrected the sentencesby the judges, and one cannot overlook the fact that such frequentinterventions on the part of the police to improve on the sentences bythe judges represented a signal for the much desired event of takingover the power to punish by the police, and the man in charge of theMinistry conscious of his duty had to take that into account.Document NG-508, which my defense counsel has mentioned, is thereproduction of a passage from a Hitler speech concerning theadministration of justice; it was a speech before the Reichstag; andthat concerned in general the necessity of severe punishment in timesof war; and according to my duty I brought this speech to the attentionof the judges.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *Q. In Document NG-102, Prosecution Exhibit 75,[258] you made thesuggestion for a confirmation of sentences by the presidents of thedistrict courts of appeal. Under what circumstances did you make thatsuggestion?A. This suggestion to have the sentences by the courts confirmed is inclose causal connection with this practice of transferring prisonersto the police.[259] Hitlers Reichstag speech of April 1942 left nodoubt in my mind that these interventions would increase, and mysuggestion was to the effect that Hitler should delegate the right,the prerogative which he reserved for himself, to the Ministry ofJustice and to the presidents of the district courts of appeal. Ifthis had been achieved, the whole matter would have remained in thehands of the administration of justice, for even the applications fornonconfirmation according to my draft were supposed to be made bythe attorneys general who in turn had received instructions from theMinistry.My letter in regard to this question of confirmation shows again whatmeans I had to use. I could not reveal the real reason if I did notwant to be unsuccessful from the very beginning. Bormann, however, inthis case saw through my reasons. In a letter from Bormann to Lammers,Bormann writes, this attempt was again a confirmation of the will ofthe administration of justice to keep these matters in their own hands,as, for example, the question of analogy [analogy provision of article2, Reich Criminal (Penal) Code], or the extraordinary objection or thenullity plea; but in the Ministry of Justice there was not the will toapply these means with the necessary severity. Above all, Bormann sawclearly that if my draft had become law, Hitlers right of interventionwould have been destroyed with one stroke. All the presidents of thedistrict courts of appeal were supposed to pronounce their decisions inHitlers name, and if they had confirmed in the name of Hitler, Hitlercould no longer have attacked their opinion. If I may use a commonexpression, I can say that Bormann, the fox, did not fall for the trap.In that connection, perhaps, I may point out two things. Lammersremark in the document shows that I refused to have the Party drawninto this confirmation procedure basically. Furthermore, the documentshows how I had to go about such things. These confirmation sentencesexisted in the case of military courts, that is also in the case of airforce courts which were subordinate to the Commander in Chief of theAir Force, that is Goering. Thus, I could count an understanding formy suggestion in the case of Goering, and, therefore, I secured hissupport through a special oral report on my suggestion.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *_CROSS-EXAMINATION_       *       *       *       *       *       *       *MR. LAFOLLETTE: Doctor, I would like to go back, now, toProsecution Exhibit No. 75, which is Document NG-102. Briefly that wasthe series of letters and correspondence beginning in May 1942, whichcontains your proposed method of handling clemency matters afterHitlers speech of 26 April 1942. Do you remember?DEFENDANT SCHLEGELBERGER: Yes, it is a question of confirmingthe sentences.Q. Yes. On 6 May 1942, you wrote Dr. Lammers--addressed the letter toReich Minister Dr. Lammers--   Dear Sir:   During our last conversation, I already told you that I   intended to propose to the Fuehrer the introduction of a   confirmation of judgment passed; a plan to which you agreed.I am leaving out a sentence; I dont think it is necessary. Its in therecord here.   Today I am transmitting to you an open letter to the Fuehrer   along with draft of the decree requesting them to the Fuehrer.   Copies for your files are attached.Then on the same day, 6 May 1942, you wrote to Hitler, and you startedthe letter, My Fuehrer, and you stated, among other things:   If you, my Fuehrer, could decide by signing the attached draft   of a decree, to transfer to the Reich Minister of Justice this   right of confirmation for cases in which you do not want to   decide yourself, the following would be achieved.Then it lists a technical analysis of the decree, as you see it. Then Igo to the last paragraph of your letter addressed, my Fuehrer, of 6May 1942, which reads in the English text:   Therefore, I believe that, if you, my Fuehrer, will agree to   the draft, I could assume the responsibility that the punishment   awards of the courts will not lead to complaints any more.Now that followed the speech of Hitler on 26 April 1942. Do you recallwriting that letter?A. Yes.Q. On 12 May 1942, in this same exhibit and document, you write againto Dr. Lammers, and this time you say:   Dear Reich Minister Dr. Lammers:   With regard to your request, I am sending you today some   material from which, I think, follows that a Reich Minister of   Justice controlling criminal justice cannot dispense with the   possibility not to confirm a sentence. I may add that when the   draft of the decree was already under way to you, Reich Marshal   Goering explained to me in detail at a visit in Karinhall that   he in the sphere of Wehrmacht justice, sector Luftwaffe,   could only overcome the difficulties of heterogeneous legal   administration by this confirmation, and that in his opinion it   was definitely necessary to introduce the confirmation also for   civil justice.Then I am going to skip a sentence and Id like to read the lastparagraph of the letter:   I would be especially grateful to you, dear Reich Minister   Lammers, if you would present the matter to the Fuehrer again. I   have the hope therewith that, if the Fuehrer rejects the present   handling of criminal justice, and on the strength of your   argument, knows that the confirmatory proceeding is the only and   safe remedy, he will not withhold this remedy from the Reich   Minister of Justice.   With best wishes and Heil Hitler,   Yours very sincerely, signed Dr. Schlegelberger.As I recall your testimony, it was that Hitler had been very abusive toyou in his speech of 26 April 1942, and that after that you had made upyour mind to resign. Is that what you testified to?A. Yes. I have said that I wanted to make it clear whether theseattacks were directed against the administration of justice, and inthat case I was determined to let matters drift toward a break and towithdraw from my office.Q. Now I know that you said in 1941 that Goering had said to you thathe would never forgive you and Dr. Guertner for centralizing justice,is that correct?A. Yes.Q. And now when you desired to have a conversation with Goering, wouldyou go to Karinhall or would he come to the Reich Ministry of Justice,as a rule?A. No, no. In such cases when Goering wanted to speak to me, he calledme up and asked me to come and see him. Goering at that time dealt witha case in which he wanted to have a legal opinion. That was why hewanted to talk to me. On that occasion, we came into that conversation.Q. Did Goering agree to support your plan at this conversation you hadwith him between 6 and 12 May 1942, or do you recall?A. I take the liberty to explain that. I told him what my plan was, andhe told me, But that is the only possibility to handle these things.[He said] I could not get anywhere in my field if I did not have thatright of confirmation.Q. Now in May 1942--about that time during May and June 1942--ReichMarshal Goering would have had the capacity to be a very strong ally,did he not?A. That could be stated in that general way, and now in retrospect Icould not state for any particular month because the relations betweenHitler and Goering changed continuously. And with Goering it might havebeen similarly. It depended upon the question in what temper Hitler wasmet.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *      b.

National socialism, which was born duringthe First World War, is the pivotal point of this revolution. Havingwelded the German nation together politically from 1918 to 1933into a national community it is about in the present World War toorganize Europe anew and to create a new world philosophy. It goeswithout saying that during such a world revolution certain fieldsof human endeavor cannot keep pace. Among such fields belongs, inparticular--along with all the arts and sciences--jurisprudence. Thefirst decisions in history were always made by men and nations inthe elementary struggle for power. But the aim of this tremendousreorganization of the world is that for the first time in history notpower, but justice will be victorious. In periods of transition thisjustice must prevail in different ways from the ways it chooses inuntroubled times of peace. The scope of a peacetime administration ofjustice is often too narrow to do justice to present events. Thus, ahistorical revolution such as the present one will, of necessity, bringabout a crisis in law, and particularly a crisis in the administrationof justice; and the extent and intensity of this crisis depend on theextent of the revolution. A crisis is customarily defined as a stateof the most violent intensification of the symptoms of a sickness,which is followed by a decisive turn, either toward the worse, tofinal descent--death in the case of man, and dissolution in thatof a public institution--or the pendulum swings to the other sideafter the climax of the crisis, toward recovery. The present crisisin the administration of justice today is close to such a climax.A totally new conception of the administration of justice must becreated, particularly a National Socialist judiciary, and for this thedruggists salve is not sufficient; only the knife of the surgeon, aswill later be shown, can bring about the solution.                                  IIWhat is the present state of German justice? Complete and clear frontsare drawn--on the one side are all the activist forces in Germany,particularly the old guard of the Party, to whom todays justice is ahindrance in the pursuance of their aims. Natural friction occurs dailybetween elementary law, such as it is experienced by the activists, andthe law as it is administered by the legal authorities of today. Inevery German village, and in every German city, modern jurisprudence,as the representative of the law, especially the judge and his verdict,have lost their influence considerably in the ancient strugglebetween might and right. We find that the pronouncement of justicedoes not enjoy in our totalitarian state the authority it deserves. Onthe other side are the representatives of justice who complain aboutthis condition, namely, about the extensive elimination of judicialprocedures; the lack of authority of the verdicts; the revision oflawful judicial sentences by police measures; the dwindling confidenceof the people in their judges; the slight regard generally accordedthe judges position in the press, on the air, and in films, etc. TheGerman judge, the true representative of justice, stands alone andunprotected, presuming upon his so-called independence, above all,justice; and the German judges have hitherto not succeeded in gainingthe _confidence of the Fuehrer_. It is true, German justicehas become, organizatorially speaking, a united Reich justice, andall efforts are being made to create a National Socialist justice.Jurisprudence strives--if only with varied success--to fit into theNational Socialist ideology. A close relationship based on trust,however, does not exist between the Fuehrer and German justice, norbetween the German nation and the NSDAP which represents the people onthe one hand, and German jurisprudence on the other. This distinguishesthe present crisis from all the previous ones. The fact thatjurisprudence has been greatly criticized at all times lies in the verynature of the problem. It has even been stated that criticism followsthe pronouncement of justice as inevitably as the shadow follows thebody. From all periods of history, and from all civilized countries,cases can be cited which originate in the excitement over an injusticewhich a judge may have done to a person (Platos Apology; Voltaireswritings in connection with the trial of Calas; Zolas Jaccuse). Hewho goes to the judge believes that he is in the right. If he triumphs,he considers it a matter of course; if he is defeated, he thinks he hasbeen wronged. However, the present condition is basically different.Justice today cannot turn to anyone. It has not gained so far theconfidence of the leaders nor that of the NSDAP, and it is about tolose the confidence of the people. But without such confidence, withouta connecting link with the leaders and with the people, justice iscondemned to a final decline. It requires this confidence as manrequires the air he breathes, in order to be able to live.                                  IIIIn a situation of this nature those who are responsiblefor the administration of justice have a historicalresponsibility--_self-recognition_. There is a painting by Raphaelin one of the rooms of the Vatican, the Stanza della Segnatura, whichrepresents the goddess of justice [Justitia] with her three genii--thegenius of truth, holding her torch on high; the two-faced genius ofwisdom; and her third companion, holding up a mirror to the goddess,the genius of self-recognition. Why does the Fuehrer, the Party, andthe people criticize the administration of justice? What are thecauses? What suggestions can justice itself make to the Fuehrer, inorder to eliminate this condition?1. Occasionally, the opinion is expressed that an authoritarianstate can tolerate _no_ strong judiciary _whatsoever_. The dynamicsof national socialism exclude, it is said, the static which is thevery essence of justice. The independent judge is a sad remnant of aliberalistic epoch, and there is no real justification for a separateministry of justice in addition to a national ministry of the interiorand the police. Also the National Socialist Reich came to power withoutthe support of law; indeed, it did so _despite_ the law. Consequently,it can solve its future problems without the help of the law, or atleast without a strong legal system. History shows time and again--andthe period since 1933 has confirmed it in many spheres of publiclife--that progress is a series of contradictions. White followsblack. It is understandable that many old Party comrades raise thecry: fight against the judge _per se_; and they do so as a reactionagainst the legalistic state of the 19th century, against the neutral,unpolitical administration of justice, against judges who were trainedunpolitically, who were taught to follow closely to the letter of thelaw, and whose independence finally resulted in the separation of thepeople and the state. Two aspects of this reaction are valid._a._ The bourgeois-liberalistic state which, under the influence ofthe doctrine of the division of power, empowered the courts to controllegislation and administration, has finally been superseded by theunity of the Reich. The courts are merely an organ of the state, asthe arm is only a limb of the human body. However, this arm can neverset its own head aright. Law must _serve_ the political leadership.Justice is not control of the leadership, neither is it protection ofthe individual _against_ the state; rather, it is a function of thecommunity which should serve to _regulate_ the community life. Thefunctions and the jurisdiction of the judge, in particular his relationto other departments, will therefore have to be redefined. But beforethis decision is reached, which is of such far-reaching consequencesfor the entire development of our Reich, the administration ofjustice itself has to be reformed radically in the interests of theReich itself. This decision must not be influenced in any way by theexperiences which the leadership has had with the law during thepast 10 years. Otherwise, the danger exists that an unorganic andplanless undermining from within, and a gradual fragmentation of theadministration of justice will occur--as they have already set in,because the administration of justice has failed. The criterion,however, for the functions of justice and particularly of the judge inthe National Socialist Reich must be a justice which meets the demandsof national socialism. Therefore, suggestions must be submitted to theFuehrer which clearly define what such a justice, and particularly aNational Socialist judge, must be like._b._ In the second place, this reaction of antagonism toward lawis justified because the _present moment_ absolutely demands a rigidrestriction of the power of law. He who is striding giganticallytoward a new world order cannot move in the limitation of an orderlyadministration of justice. To accomplish such a far-reaching revolutionin domestic and foreign policy is only possible if, on the one handall outmoded institutions, concepts, and habits have been done awaywith--if need be, in a brutal manner--and if, on the other handinstitutions that are in themselves necessary but are not directlyinstrumental in the achievement of a great goal and which, in fact,impede it, are temporarily thrust to the background. All clamorabout lawlessness, despotism, injustice, etc., is at present nothingbut a lack of insight into the political situation. The question issolely: Is a strong judiciary incompatible with the National Socialistauthoritarian state (Fuehrerstaat) _per se_, that is, permanently, oronly _temporarily_?2. He who is used to thinking along historical lines and whounderstands the essence of national socialism will have no doubts as tothe answer. Justice has at all times been the strongest pillar of everygreat civilized state. Great empires fell when despotism and corruptiontook the place of justice and of order; great empires rose to heightsbeyond imagination when the central figure, the actual creator, theembodiment of the concept of justice--the judge--represented authority.It was accepted as a matter of course during the classical age of theImperium Romanum that the most exalted and honored place in the statewas occupied by the praetor along with the consul--not to mention theenormous cultural influence that Roman praetorian law has exerted forcenturies on the whole of Europe. The judge was the highest official ofthe state also during the height of the British Empire. Italian fascismalso recognized the importance of this question for the preservationof its empire by agreeing with me on the following propositions at theGerman-Italian Conference held in Vienna in March 1939.                             Proposition 5   The judge, in contrast to other civil servants, derives his   authority directly from the state leadership.                             Proposition 8   Among civil servants the judge occupies a unique position in   the organization of both states.What a far-reaching influence was exerted on the Germanization processof the East in the early Middle Ages by the highly developed citylaws, particularly by the law of Magdeburg and Luebeck! The law andtherefore the judge has always been one of humanitys most prominentrepresentatives of civilization. Also the aim of the gigantic strugglefor existence in which the German people are at present engaged is toreplace power and despotism by justice and order (the new order) inEurope and the entire world. There is no order without a strong law.Likewise the inner worth of the National Socialist Reich consists inthe fact that every citizen does not think of it, his Reich, as theembodiment of the interests of individual pressure groups or parties,but of his sense of justice. In the eyes of the German people, moreso than in the eyes of many other peoples, justice is and remains themost treasured gift; it is not the illusion of equal rights for all,but is in line with the old Prussian saying, to each his own. Thesuperficial view that an authoritarian state cannot tolerate a vigorousjudiciary is therefore wrong. The better the inner strength of a stateis consolidated, the better is justice assured and the stronger istherefore the judiciary. Only a state based on external force must beafraid of a strong judge, and history has shown time and again thatnothing leads faster to self-annihilation than a paucity of laws and afeeble administration of justice. The judge is the representative ofjustice. It is he who in the eyes of the people is the guarantor ofjustice, not the professional jurist nor the public prosecutor, nor theattorney; because he, the judge, administers justice, uninfluenced byfriend or foe, unbiased and unswayed by the quarrels and tendencies ofthe day, not prey to human foibles. With him rests the decision overlife and death; he intervenes decisively in every sphere of human lifeand in the most treasured possessions of a people such as liberty,honor, family, work, land, etc. Here the people expect an unflinchingrepresentative of a strong law who seeks the truth and justice withintense devotion and a clear mind. Nor can a political leader, even thebest, nor a Landrat nor a Gestapo official be at the same time a judge.They all perform completely different functions; they must direct,organize, plan, and look into the future. Their decisions too must bejust, but the idea of justice is not the guiding principle of theirvocation. They all require a counterpoise in the form of a magistrateof whom the great Ulpian says: Priests are we, because we fosterrighteousness and preach the knowledge of what is good and just.Corruption, personal selfish interests, vanity and craving for powerwhich happen to play an important part in human life, cannot--apartfrom having a rigid political leadership--be better prevented thanthrough the fact alone that a strict judiciary authority exists.3. And this is where the awareness of their mission and the historicalobligation begins for the men responsible for the German judges.They are to see that the fire of justice never quite dies not evenduring the most difficult times of a great world revolution. TheGerman ideals of justice embodied in a strong judiciary must--sinceit is timeless--be fitted into the future construction of a NationalSocialist Reich. This, however, is possible only when the firecontinues to glow. Political situations require constant measures ofopportuneness, and every stubborn resistance to it--on principle orfundamental deliberations--is senseless. But one must be constantlyaware of the danger that the very convenient putting aside of aregulated administration of justice conceals the _tendency ofhabit_. It is the task of a new German justice to prevent such adevelopment. This cannot be achieved, however, by bewailing the presentcondition or even by resigning herself to it. She must look into themirror and ask herself: _What can I do to put at the disposal of theFuehrer a justice and judges in which he may have confidence?_                                  IVTheoretically, the constitutional position of the German judge,especially his position in respect to the Fuehrer, is not difficult tosolve. Overcoming the division of power the Fuehrer is not only thelegislator and executioner of power, but also the _supreme judge_.Theoretically, the authority to pass judgment is therefore only his.If he could carry out this authority also in practice, there would beno more judiciary problem and no legal crisis. But he cannot do so.Therefore, he has transferred his authority to the individual judge,that is, directly without any further administrative channels. Thejudge acts differently from any other official who is a member of asometimes rather long official hierarchy, by virtue of a decree issuedto him _direct_ by the Fuehrer. This is the meaning of freedom of thebench. Every other private Party official or public office has toabstain from all interference or influence upon the judgment. Thissuperior position corresponds to the obligations of the judge to findjustice exclusively according to National Socialist ideas. _Because ajudge who is in direct relation of fealty to the Fuehrer must judgelike the Fuehrer._ In order to guarantee this, a direct liaisonofficer without any intermediate agency must be established betweenthe Fuehrer and the German judge, that is, also in the form of ajudge, the supreme judge in Germany, the _Judge of the Fuehrer_. Heis to convey to the German judge the will of the Fuehrer by authenticexplanation of the laws and regulations. At the same time he must uponthe request of the judge give binding information in current trialsconcerning fundamental, political, economic, or legal problems whichcannot be surveyed by the individual judge.That only the best are considered worthy of a privileged position suchas the judge holds can also be seen from another reason. The formerlegislation was suspicious and therefore casuistic toward the judge. Itattempted to regulate every conceivable fact of law, thereby degradingthe judge to a subsumptive mechanism. The Fuehrer as legislator,however, knows that a living peoples law which can be understoodby every citizen and which is to reach a truly just sentence in theindividual case can be established only by an elastic legislation withfar-reaching opinions of the judge. The multicolored and versatilelife is therefore fettered as little as possible by the law today.Every Reichsgesetzblatt teems with such general terms as--normalsentiment [of the people], dignity and etiquette, honesty, NationalSocialist ideology, etc. This loose binding to the law of the judgewithout an excellent judiciary personality is, however, a contradictionin itself and will forcibly endanger justice, unity, and securityof law considerably. National Socialist free method of legislation,creation of a living peoples law, and quality of the judge thereforenecessarily act and react on one another.Repeated theoretical demands for a National Socialist personality asjudge are not enough. One must recognize reasonably and clearly thatthe present type of judge--no reproach should hereby be made to anindividual judge--in his historic development, his training, and hisselection does not and cannot meet this demand. And just as reasonableare the practical deductions to be made from this.                                   VThe _historic development of the German judiciary_ is in short thefollowing:At the same time at which the Roman law, which in no way whateverwas connected with the German national consciousness, was introducedin Germany (15th century), the freely elected German _peoples_judge was replaced by the _civil servant_, the professionaljudge. He studied at first at Italian universities, and later--upto the present time--his method of thought was influenced by legalreasoning in accordance with Roman law. Originally he, though an alien,was nevertheless, in his capacity as the highest official of theindividual sovereigns, an authority in the country; thus, 19th centuryliberalism, with its hypertrophy of laws, its plethora of courts,its wild pursuit of litigation, and its juridical thinking, led to asteady increase in the number of judges, and indeed to a debasing,vulgarization, and bureaucratizing of the judges. In a liberal statethese judges became independent simultaneously in the sense of acomplete detachment from people and state. The authority of the judgecan be determined by two entirely different means: Once by grantinghim a superior position and by letting only few qualified men with astrong personality become judges--then the authority and the so-calledindependence will as a matter of course come out to a certain extent asa by-product--or else the judges position will be formally convertedunder severe stress into a bureaucratic civil service position in whichhe will attempt to carry through his conception of law by being grantedindependence through legal guaranty. Prussia, and with her the restof the German states, consequently the second German Reich, took thelatter way.National socialism will have to proceed on the first path. Becausethe nature of national socialism is in direct contrast to thisdegeneration of the old German, nonbureaucratic peoples judge whichoccurred historically through foreign influence. National socialismwill revive the concept of German judge as prototype the same as itcreated the concepts of Fuehrer, followers, folk-community, honor,loyalty, farmer, soil. It will also have to clear the concept of Germanjudge as prototype of human society from all that is foreign to him,all that has stuck to him in the course of the developments of thelast centuries, and ask itself the question: What does a German mindunderstand by the term judge?According to the concept which every German has of a German communitythe judge is a fundamental type of human life. Just like the farmer,the soldier, and the various types of trade, the judge too belongsto every community developed beyond the most primitive state. Thecharacteristics of the prototype of judge are--1. That he is _independent and not confined to directions_. A judge whohas to ask someone else for the sentence is just as much a caricatureas a farmer without a plough and a soldier without a weapon. Upon thefact that the judge can use his own discretion is founded the magic ofthe word judge.2. And a second item is in our description of a German community.The judge has a strong inner _authority_. He is the interpreter oflaw who is superior to all other servants of the state in knowledge,experience, and humanity. That the German people have a fine feelingfor a strong, responsible, independent judge for the decision of itsinterests, can be seen among other things from the following: Inspite of all judiciary crises and in spite of every reproach againstthe judges and their decisions, national socialism has never called:Dismiss the judges, we do not wish or require judges any longer! Thediscontented have always turned only against the present ones andhave demanded better. Neither the laborer nor the farmer, neither thebusinessman, nor the tradesman has ever voiced the desire to appointfor the settlement of their arguments in place of a judge an officialwho is bound by instructions. However, something entirely different hasoccurred, with the Fuehrer a man has risen within the German peoplewho awakens the oldest, long forgotten times. Here is a man who in hisposition represents the ideal of the judge in its perfect sense, andthe German people elected him for their judge--first of all, of course,as judge over their fate in general, but also as supreme magistrateand judge. The mail received in the Fuehrers office in one day wouldprove this. No wonder, that next to this man, the German bureaucraticjudge who represents so little of long established judiciary grandeurhad to lose further authority. The special interest we have in thiselection of the Fuehrer to supreme judge in the united Reich is theacknowledgement of the _true_ judge. This does not infer a renunciationof the concept of the judges itself, as is sometimes concluded, but itdoes infer a renunciation of the bureaucratic judge. The spontaneousrecognition of the Fuehrer as supreme judge of the German people isessentially due to the fact that the Fuehrer wholly independent,separate from any influence or person, not supported by any machine ofstate but solely by the loyalty of the people fights for the rightsof the German people within and without its borders, that is, allqualities which personify a true judge.3. And thirdly, there will be only _one_ judge in our community. Justimagine! There is a judge on every corner of a market place which wesee before us. One feels that 3 of them are too many, while there maysafely be 4 tailors, even 40. That they might not have enough workwould not fundamentally disturb our imagination. But 4 judges. Thesymbol that there is only _one_ right, only _one_ justice as presentedso clearly in the single judge, would be obliterated. One would beginto compare as in the case of 4 stores--where do I get better right?The authority of the judgment suffers if more judges than needed arepresent.Practical considerations also make a _radical reduction of the numberof judges_ imperative. During the next decades Germany simply willnot have enough young students who have the requirements for theprofession of a judge, who have the inclination and aptitude to becomea lawyer, and especially a judge, in such an active period. Thethorough laying off of personnel which must take place in the entireGerman administration after the war is even more urgent and justifiedin the case of judges, as this reduction is in line with the essentialsof judges, they being the representatives of the one _law_ and the one_justice_.                                  VIThe historic evolution of the German judge is also in conformitywith his _training_ and his _selection_. To decide what is rightdoes not require constructive or scientific thinking but above all,it presupposes the art to appraise human beings, to understand humanemotions and the ability to comprehend all phenomena of life. Trainingmethods of today lead to abstract thinking, to materialism, and to anignorance of the ways of the world. The theoretical scientific methodtaught nowadays in universities is apt to imbue the student afterbeing first introduced to a juristic line of thought with abstractconceptions and with a system of logic which makes it very difficultfor the student to find his way later on in a world of facts. Theoutcome is the abstract lawyer, subject to so much criticism who doesno longer recognize human beings but only conceptions, moreover, it isalso the source of ever recurring disagreements between politicallytrained National Socialists and lawyers. Very often there is a world ofdifference between them. The point from which all training reforms mustgo out must be paragraph 20 of the Party program, which reads:   The curriculum of all educational institutions must be adapted   to _practical life_.In detail this means--1. Substitution of the logical, abstract method of thinking by a_method of conception taken from practical everyday life_. Nolecture with a deductive training method, given by a professor toa hundred or more listeners, but some kind of working community ofperhaps twenty to thirty students who will be introduced inductivelyto the system--that is empirically from life--by a teacher endowedwith scientific, practical and educational talents. These teachers areeither university teachers who carry out at the same time the duties ofa judge or administrative lawyer, or else judges in office who teachsimultaneously at a university. The selection of about 200 qualifiedleaders who must be held in readiness at the end of the war for afundamental reeducation of our youth is the most pressing problem. Onlysuch men are able to guide the productive energies of the beginnersinto the right channels, and so prevent a false, abstract education aswell as the cutting of lectures and the cramming down of lessons.2. These working communities to be established in universities mustever maintain close contact with practical work (court, administration,Party). The strict division practiced heretofore--at first 3 yearsuniversity training exclusively, then 3 years practical work--hasprovided them with a dangerous, theoretical preinoculation.3. A man who chooses to be a judge and who therefore administersjustice to all phases of human endeavor must know life itself, thereal and practical life. Therefore, anyone who after passing theprobationary state examination, at the approximate age of 26, hasworked for 2 years in the judicial sphere as a candidate with somecourt--as has been customary heretofore--has not the calling of ajudge. He has only become acquainted there with a small sector oflife from a very definite angle. Only he who has steeled himselfand proved his mettle outside a safe civil service position shallpass judgment and decide over human lives. He may stand his test inaccordance with his inclination in economic life (banking, industry,shipping, commerce, agriculture), or as an attorney who looks at theobjects of justice from another angle, or by taking an active partin Party or administrative life either at home or abroad. The decisivefactor is that the future judge has not lived his life only behindbars. He also must have stood before the bars, in real life. Theserequirements lead us to recognize two facts._a._ No one should be appointed a judge before the age of 35. Tojudge requires a ripe judgment, a certain spiritual detachment, and avery pronounced character; qualities which can hardly be asked of a28-year-old candidate who has never had to struggle in real life._b._ No one who has acquired a life position in another professionwishes to become a judge at the age of 35, unless the followingprimary conditions are created: _The position of a German judgemust be of such high standard with regards to ideal and materialrewards as to attract even the best of our youth._ By an _elasticlegislation_ and the _freedom of the bench_, the leadership ofthe State places such full confidence upon the judges--as are grantedto no one else in an autocratic state--that only the best can beconsidered to deserve this confidence. He who has begun a thing must goon with it; if there are to be men in an autocratic state invested withthe freedom of the bench, then this freedom should be granted to a fewand exceedingly well qualified men only.                                  VIIThe demand to reduce the number of judges--I reckon with a reductionfrom about 16,000 to about 8,000 for Germany proper--gives us theproblem of _a fundamental reform of the entire organizationfor the administration of justice_. A mere reduction of thepersonnel without a simultaneous reform of working methods and of theorganization would not result in improving the work but only to itsdeterioration as is the case everywhere else in general administration.I have laid down my conception of this reform of justice in thefollowing detailed proposals:1. The general political satisfaction of the people and the concept ofa national community of interest, which is growing more and more, willalready _by themselves_ relieve the courts of much work.2. Much work is done which is only in a general way connected with theadministration of justice and which is more of an administrative thanof a judicial nature. This work can well be done and without harm _byother administrative departments_. I mean herewith a large part of thework done by voluntary jurisdiction, such as recording of deeds andgeneral registry work. The core of the administration of justice froma political point of view--that is, the administration of criminallaw--must, on the other hand, remain in its entirety in the care ofthe judiciary as it should under no circumstances be torn and split upamong several other ministries.3. The organization of the courts, comprised at present of fourlevels--lower court of first level, district courts [Landgericht],court of appeal, and the supreme court--must be converted into anorganization of _three levels_--district court [Kreisgericht], Gaucourt, and supreme court--to conform to the new political organizationof the Reich and to party jurisdiction.All proceedings at law must be based upon the district court[Kreisgericht] which will no longer be provided with three judgesas at present the district court [Landgericht] but only with one.Moreover, _trial by one judge only will be the ideal and the rule ofthe administration of justice_. The district judge is the principallink between the judges and the people. Establishing the facts at thesource is decisive for all subsequent findings, as this establishedthe closest contact with real life in respect of time and locality.The exodus from the country to higher positions, observed withmuch concern in the case of judges and which is in concurrence withthe exodus from the country by the people in general and also ofinterior administrative organs, must be counteracted with all meanswith the aid of political pressure on the personnel concerned. Thedistrict judge must be--from a human and from a professional point ofview--the most efficient judge of all. Legislation has placed all meansat his disposal for a quick and correct judicial decision. It must be_he_ who is directing all proceedings at law, and not the partiesas has been customary heretofore. A state of affairs is untenablewhere the parties at times just tested their ground in the court ofthe first level, and where they were reluctant to admit the truth andthe evidence, because they will go to the Reich Supreme Court in anycase. The better the guaranties created in the first level with regardto personnel and proceedings, the less will be the justified demandfor the _means for legal redress_. Of course, the possibilityfor a re-examination of each and every judgment (with the exceptionof petty cases) must remain. The authority that goes with the worduncontestable may be only accorded to the decisions of the Fuehrer.But the primary conditions for the application of legal remedies willbe rendered more difficult. The capitalist conception of the value ofmatter in litigation shall no longer be the standard as at present,but the standard must be the importance and the effect a judgment willhave on the public in general and on the further evolution of justice.The Gau court at the residence of the Gauleiter and Oberpraesidentwill be designated as court of appeal and will be provided with threejudges in accordance with the _Fuehrer principle_; the ReichSupreme Court with three or five judges sits as court of revisionalso in accordance with the Fuehrer principle, therefore not subjectto the outcome of voting but to leadership. I am, in principle,against all centralization. In spite of the foregoing, the place forthe Reich Supreme Court of Greater Germany is in the capital of theReich, consequently in Berlin and not in Leipzig (a compromise of thesecond Reich). The Reich Supreme Court will not act as at present asa court of revision for all cases of a certain value of the matter indispute. It is only competent with regard to maintaining a uniformadministration of justice and to guarantee stability of law.Titles such as Amtsgerichtsrat, Landgerichtsrat, Oberlandesgerichtsrat,and Reichsgerichtsrat are out of place to describe the activitiesof judges of the future. A judge does not give counsel but passesjudgment. Therefore, the only title that corresponds to the matter inquestion and with his activity is the title of judge.4. The merger of the present day Amtsgerichte and the Landgerichte toestablish a Kreisgericht [district court] with its seat probably atthe residence of the Landrat [county councilor], or of the districtparty leader, means the _abolition of many smaller courts not capableof sustaining themselves_. Apart from this, the conception of theAmtsrichter as the father of a small community has died out longago. In his place stepped the young and forever coming and goingassistant [assessor] who has to prove himself or the Amtsgerichtsratwith his all too narrow outlook on life who has very often becomeembittered because he had not been promoted or did not have enough todo. The decisive factor is not his judicial wisdom but his authority asa human being. Consequently, _the honorary (unpaid) justice of peaceshall_ try petty cases of every day occurrence in each community.He is not requested to have a legal training, in as much as it ishis duty to reconcile the parties and to restore the peace betweenneighbors. The man who enjoys the most authority of all men in thecommunity--in accordance with the prevailing characteristics of theplace, he may be a trusted senior party member, a pensioned officer, ora farmer--will be given the chance to perform here a most beneficialactivity. Besides, for judicial matters requiring the attention of atrained lawyer, the judge of the district court [Kreisrichter] in hiscapacity as a circuit judge will hold court in case of need on specialcourt days in communities belonging to his district. In this way everyGerman fellow citizen has access to a court in his place of domicile,moreover, the judge heretofore confined to a too limited sphere for hisactivities will automatically disappear.5. The duties of a judge must have an exclusively judicial character.All duties not requiring for their discharge the special schooling,experience, and training of a judge must be transferred to the_judicial administrator_, the higher, intermediate civil servantof the administration of justice. The satisfactory experience madeby the general interior administration, and by financial and postaloffices in regard to their well versed, old time magistrates and chiefinspectors may well serve as an example. _To relieve the higherofficials_ of some of their duties and to delegate them to lowergrade civil servants prevents the former from becoming narrow-minded,short-sighted, and trivial and imbues the latter with the_readiness to assume responsibilities_. The duties of a judicialadministrator--in places not provided with an official domicile of adistrict judge--consists of preparing current work and applicationsintended for the district judge [Kreisrichter] but also for the justiceof the peace.                                 VIIITherefore, it will be possible to produce the type of NationalSocialist judge only by--1. A radical change of training methods.2. A radical reduction in the personnel.3. Removing the judges from the civil service.4. A radical change in the entire judicial organization.This means a sweeping judicial reform top to bottom, talked aboutfor decades, even for centuries, but which was not accomplishedeither by the second or by the intermediate Reich [Weimar Republic].Administrative work and decisions on each and every point require agreat deal of time. Consequently, these problems must be tackled assoon as possible from within the administration, not although, butbecause we are engaged in war; not because they will come into forceand practice during the war, but because they must be held in readinessfor after the war. Frontline soldiers returning from the war can beassured that the preparation made for the appointment of NationalSocialist judges will contribute its share of safeguarding for alltime the ideals they have fought for. And the judiciary system, if notcompletely transformed and reorganized, will hardly attract to it thebest of the returning soldiers primed with energy, wanting to quenchtheir thirst for peaceful and constructive work. Well qualified andvigorous judges are indispensable for the enormous peacetime tasks instore for the great Germanic Reich.Hamburg, 31 March 1942                                             [Signed] ROTHENBERGER    TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT NG-389    PROSECUTION EXHIBIT 76REPORT FROM DEFENDANT ROTHENBERGER TO DEFENDANT SCHLEGELBERGER, 11MAY 1942, NOTING ROTHENBERGERS INTENTION TO INTENSIFY THE INTERNALDIRECTION AND STEERING OF THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE, AND ENCLOSINGCOPIES OF ROTHENBERGERS INSTRUCTIONS TO JUDGES IN HIS DISTRICTThe President of the Hanseatic Court of Appeal  3130 E--1a/4                                              Hamburg 36, 11 May 1942                               Personal!

IIThe Fuehrers speech of 26 April 1942 did not surprise me very much. Itconfirmed to me the regrettable fact that the Fuehrer has no confidencein the German administration of justice and in the German judges. Aradical National Socialist reform of the legal system which I havesuggested for years in verbal and written reports[261] has thereforebecome even more urgent.The effect of the Fuehrers speech on the judges in my district wasabsolutely crushing. It is impossible to gauge the effect on the Germanjudges of the proclamation regarding the removal of judges and the wayin which this was made known to the world in the form of an enablingact[262] passed by the Reichstag with frantic applause. I thereforeconsidered it my first duty to counteract this effect by taking thefollowing measures:1. On Tuesday, 28 April, I had a preliminary discussion with mypresidents to hear how my staff felt about the matter.2. On Wednesday, 29 April, I discussed the present situation in detailwith the Gauleiter and asked him to address, together with me, alljudges of my district.3. We did this on Friday, 1 May. I spoke for approximatelythree-quarters of an hour, next the Gauleiter spoke for about 20minutes. Neither of us glossed over the seriousness of the situation;we openly faced the Hamburg judges whose jurisdiction did not cause thepresent crisis, and we stressed the necessity for a fundamental reform.We pointed out that two dangers had to be forestalled:   _a._ further loss of authority of the judges verdict,   _b._ a feeling of doubt on the part of the judges or of   anxiety with regard to their familys livelihood.I have, therefore assumed responsibility for each verdict which thejudges discuss with me before passing it.4. On Wednesday, 6 May, the Gauleiter upon my request addressed allpolitical and economic leaders of Hamburg on the subject of the presentcrisis. I considered this necessary so as not to alarm the populationand prevent attacks against the judges.5. On the same day I made arrangements with all senior police officers(the Higher SS and Police Leaders, heads of the criminal police, of theSecret State Police, and of the SD) to the effect that every complaintabout juridical measures taken by judges was to be referred to mebefore the police would take action (especially regarding execution ofsentence).6. I made similar arrangements with all representatives of the HamburgPress. The press was to refer to me before subjecting a verdict to anyform of criticism.I cannot agree with the objection to these measures on the groundsthat with other Gauleiter such procedure would not have been possible.In 1933, the Gauleiter was anything but favorably disposed towardthe judges. I am of the opinion that every political minded NationalSocialist leader can be convinced of the necessity of an orderly legalsystem, provided the system is National Socialist in character. Noteven the continued changes of political leaders in Hamburg, especiallyamong senior police officers, which have occurred since 1933, everdisturbed our smooth cooperation.                                  IIIIn view of the present situation I am intensifying the internaldirection and steering of the administration of justice which I haveconsidered to be my main task since 1933. For that purpose, I haveissued the instructions which are set out in enclosures 1, 2 and 3.                                  IVThe meeting of the chief presidents in the Reich Ministry of Justice on5 May this year did not satisfy me. It was my impression that most ofthe chief presidents were very much depressed. I do not believe thattheir inner confidence was restored in the course of the meeting.                                   VI suggest that the chief presidents should be confidentially informedof judgments passed in the Reich which have caused special criticism inthe Reich Ministry of Justice, so that the judges may get some idea ofthe Fuehrers will regarding the various spheres of the administrationof justice.

As announced in my speech of 1 May, I thereforeintend to inform myself as extensively as possible prior to the trialsof cases which are of political significance, or which involve thepossibility of a certain contradiction between formal law and thepublic sentiment or National Socialist ideology in order to discussmatters if necessary with the presidents in question. Incidentally, Iexpect the presidents more than ever before to confidently submit tome for discussion matters involving the afore-mentioned problems. Toobtain information as far as the civil senates and the criminal senateof the Hanseatic court of appeal are concerned, I have requested thepresident of the senate, Dr. Struve, at present my permanent deputy, toassist me by holding conferences with the presidents of the senates atregular intervals at which the presidents will furnish a review of thecases which will come up in the near future. Generally the report canbe brief. But it must furnish sufficient details in cases which requirespecial attention according to the Fuehrers speech, in order to enablemy deputy to decide whether my intervention is necessary or expedient.In this connection the facts of the case and the decisive legal pointsof view will have to be discussed. I expect that these arrangementswhich are only destined to serve jurisdiction and to strengthen theposition of the judges will meet with general approval, and I hope thatmy deputy will be fully supported by you. I shall of course continue tobe at your disposal for personal discussions.

WANDSCHNEIDER (counsel for the defendant Rothenberger):Dr. Rothenberger, would you please first make some general statementabout your memorandum?PRESIDING JUDGE BRAND: The exhibit number, please.DR. WANDSCHNEIDER: We are concerned with Document NG-075,Prosecution Exhibit 27,[264] in document book 1-B, page 1. I havesubmitted a list to the Court on which the documents I shall mentionare listed. Please begin with your statement.DEFENDANT ROTHENBERGER: The memorandum is a brief summary ofwhat I had worked out during the previous years in Hamburg. The reasonfor my writing such a memorandum at all, I believe, I already indicatedyesterday. I had pointed out that the development in the Reich until1942, when this memorandum was written, gave cause for growing dangersand misgivings for every jurist.[265] Furthermore, I had pointed outhow the administration of justice was pushed more and more into adefensive position by the Party and the SS and how the jurists, aswell as all Germans, either acquiesced in this condition and thisdevelopment or even went along with it, and how the administrationof justice was more and more in retreat battles. I did not want toand could not go along with this line of action. And I did not wantthe administration of justice again and again to be confronted with_faits accomplis_. The Party and the SS concerned themselveswith ideas for reforms of the administration of justice and it was myopinion that the only office which was competent for this and an expertorganization in the field was the administration of justice itself.And the starting point for the attempt to change the course of thisdevelopment were my experiences which I had gathered in Hamburg and inEngland.My conviction grew stronger and stronger to the effect that thatquestion of the position of the judge in a state was significant notonly for the administration of justice itself, but that it was a basicproblem of political life in every state. Germany had always gone fromone extreme to the other in politics, and now we were experiencing,during the year 1933 and the subsequent years, the extreme of a powerstate. And one of the causes for this was, in my conviction, that inGermany we were lacking a point of rest, an authority which due totradition and out of its independence was in a position to influencethe development critically. This impression in particular was veryvivid to me from my experiences in England. Therefore, my belief thatthe idea of the so-called Judge-King in Germany too, if there wasany chance at all, would exert an influence on the development. Thismemorandum represents a final warning to Hitler in order to hold himback from this development which had begun. If today I put the questionto myself, whether I believed that I could convince Hitler at all frommy knowledge that I have today I, of course, have to answer no to thatquestion. According to my knowledge at that time I hoped for it and Ibelieve that the fact alone that I undertook such an attempt at all isthe best proof for this; and my belief of the time will be understoodon the basis of the experiences which I had gathered in Hamburg whereit had been possible by trying to swim against the current and to exertinfluence upon leading political personalities, that one could succeedthere.The aim of my memorandum was, in the final analysis, the same as hasto be the aim of every state, namely, the rebuilding of an autonomouslaw which is independent of the form of government and without temporallimitation. In countries which have a tradition this may not be aproblem at all, but in Germany this question had for decades been theproblem, and already since 1905 leading jurists in Germany had occupiedthemselves with this problem again and again.If I had described this idea in my memorandum in very dry and barewords then this memorandum as hundreds of others would immediatelyhave been thrown into the wastepaper basket and I would have beendescribed as a fool. Therefore, I had first to describe the meanswhich could create the prerequisites for such a final condition and,therefore, I described the proximate aims which I wanted to reachfirst. I emphasized them first. In order to clarify to the Tribunalthat the position of a judge in Germany is a completely different onethan in England, and I believe also than in the United States, I haveto go into the historical development of the profession of the Germanjudge in a few words. I can do this more briefly since this historicaldevelopment is indicated briefly in this memorandum; furthermore,because in a lengthy article which I wrote at that time, which willbe submitted as an exhibit by my defense counsel, I went into thishistorical development in detail.I therefore want to say here merely by a slogan that once due to theacceptance of the Roman law in Germany in the 16th Century whichtook place only on the continent of Europe and not in England, andfurthermore caused by the development of the Prussian state where theadministration of justice, as I already emphasized yesterday, was onlya stepchild; that due to these two circumstances the judges professionplayed only a very modest and mediocre role. In Germany we had about19,000 judges who belonged to the General Civil Service and who inno way differed as far as their income, or their position, or theirreputation was concerned from an absolutely average civil servant.The essential factor in this development was that the practical courseof the education of a judge in Germany to this very day brought aboutthat only persons who were merely average lawyers decided to take upthe judges profession.If I may be permitted to do so, I would like to mention briefly how onebecomes a judge in Germany. At the age of approximately 25, one becomesassessor; at this time one decides whether one wants to become a judge.If one does decide to become a judge, one remains for a number of yearsand at that time it was about 5 to 8 years--a so-called assistantjudge, Hilfsrichter.This means that one exercises the functions of a judge, to be sure,but one can be discharged any day. And then in the course of years onefinally achieves being appointed a judge. It happened only very rarelythat a person who had been sitting as an assistant judge for a numberof years was not appointed judge.Then when one finally became a judge one received an income of about300 marks. A fairly good skilled worker in Germany earned twice asmuch. Therefore, one had to lead a very modest life. One was treated asa civil servant to the extent that every year a so-called qualificationor efficiency report had to be written about every judge. In otherwords, a report had to be made as to the qualifications of the judge.The superior of the judge had to go to the court session in order, aswe expressed it, to examine the judge; that is, to examine whether thejudge was able or not.Then, the judge waited for his next promotion which played a verydecisive role for him and for his family in view of his small income.There was a scale of promotions from the local court to the districtcourt, to the district court of appeal, and finally, to the ReichSupreme Court.This briefly described course of training thus demonstrates that thejudge in a quiet existence of a civil servant was employed only as ajudge all the time, and this gave cause to the leading German juristssince 1906 to do something about it. The first precursor of thisidea was a certain Adickes. These jurists tried to suggest a basicalteration of this course.Adickes was followed by an Under Secretary Muegel, and he in turnduring the Weimar Republic was followed by the then Reich Minister ofJustice Dr. Schiffer who today is again Minister of Justice in theRussian zone of occupation. All were of the same opinion that hisposition of the judge had to be changed fundamentally and that thiswould be possible only by a very severe reduction of the number ofjudges.If the prosecution is charging me I believe even in the indictmentitself with the fact that I in very clear words desired to change thiscondition, or suggested changing this condition, by saying that not thesalve of the drug store but the knife of the surgeon, was needed then Iam in good company in so saying to the extent that my predecessor forthese plans was Reich Minister of Justice Dr. Schiffer who by the wayis fully Jewish. He expressed the following thoughts about this problemat the time, and I quote:   The wound should not be covered up and smeared over, it   must be cut, pressed out, and scraped out. The reform in the   administration of justice which we need is not an enlargement or   a reconstruction but a thorough reduction.These plans which were discussed in Germany for 50 years, and theexecution of which failed every time, I now made my own. As can be seenfrom the memorandum, I was confronted, above all, with the problem asto what means could be used at all to bring about this reduction inthe number of judges without reducing the quality of jurisdiction. Themeans which I suggested were also very closely allied to those meanswhich had been suggested for 50 years. These means were as follows:First, the concept of the justice of the peace. I believe that I do nothave to go into the details of this position because, first of all,I assume that the Tribunal is very familiar with this institution ofa justice of the peace; and secondly, because I said something aboutit in the memorandum itself; and thirdly, because I discussed it in alengthy article which will be submitted.The second method which I suggested, and which I also discussed in alengthy article, which will be submitted as an exhibit is the idea ofthe administrator of justice [Rechtspfleger]. This is an idea whichconforms with the investigations I made in England about the master,the registrar, and the clerk.[266] The aim here is clear too, namely,that the judge should act during the trial exclusively as a judge andmust be relieved of the burden of all technical preparations and of thetasks which are not truly the tasks of a judge.The third method which I suggested was a change in the structure ofthe German courts as a whole. Details about this too are not only inmy memorandum, but in articles which will be submitted in evidencehere. My aim was to introduce, in the place of the super organizationof the German courts, a nonbureaucratic, simple, and clear structureof organization of the courts. In this organization of the courts theidea was decisive for me that every judge in Germany should have thesame rank, but not as it had been up to now where the judge had towait for and was dependent upon a promotion so that his activity, evensubconsciously, was guided by his aim of being promoted. I wanted todo away with all titles. In my opinion, every judge deserves only thetitle judge. I was of the opinion that through these changes, theinner independence of the judge would be strengthened. The decisivefactor for this inner strengthening of the judge was my suggestion totake the judges out of the general group of civil servants.In my memorandum I attempted to explain to Hitler the basic differencebetween a regular civil servant and a judge.This, of course, would have meant that the judge, from the point ofview of his income, his position, and especially his reputation,would occupy an overwhelming position in Germany. I expressed thisas follows and underlined it. The position of the German judge must,ideally and materially, be organized in such a way that it will appealto the best of the future lawyers. And with this question namely thepure civil servant career of a judge, up to this time, is connectedanother request I made, that only a person should be appointed judgewho before that had worked in another profession and had there gainedexperience, be it in economics, be it in another sector of the state,or above all, as an attorney. I was of the opinion that only a personof advanced age and older than was usual in Germany--I said that theminimum age should be 35--should become a judge, because a man who isvery young and who has not, outside of a quiet life as a civil servant,been forced to fight and to gather experience, is not able to judgeabout the fate of people which is entrusted to him in the courtroom ina just and humane manner. And the last point of these suggestions forreform is the training of judges already at the university. I startedwith the assumption that the legal questions are very essential forthe pronouncing of a sentence, but that the decisive question in everytrial is the finding of the facts and the evaluation of the persons, beit the witnesses, the plaintiff, or the defendants. The training thatwas given at the German universities was in former times exclusivelyconcerned with legal problems. At the university the students listenedas an audience to a professor who read out his lectures on legaltheory; that to be sure is necessary, but it had to be supplemented bya practical point of view. This recognition I had gained from my longexperience as a tutor in Hamburg, and therefore my detailed suggestionswhich are mentioned in the memorandum which I later carried in Berlin.And perhaps I may be permitted later to go into them in detail.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *Q. I now go into the individual cases. First I put the question to you.On page 6 [section III] of your memorandum you said (_NG-075, Pros.Ex. 27_)[267]: Occasionally the opinion is represented that anauthoritarian state cannot bear a strong judiciary. Whom did you mean?Who represented that point of view occasionally?A. That is very clear that the Party and the SS represented that pointof view.Q. You meant thus your opponents in your daily life?A. Yes.Q. In your legal practice?A. Yes, because I knew that these two organizations, the Party andthe SS, in the course of the years exerted a very strong influenceon Hitler. It was therefore decisive for me first to deal with thequestion as an immediate aim from the point of view to gain aninfluence on Hitler as a judge in order to exclude all influencesof the Party and the SS. And out of that knowledge I made therequirement that between Hitler and the German judiciary there shouldbe no intermediary; that, in other words, nobody should be allowedto influence the judge, be it a political leader, be it Bormann, beit Himmler, or any other organizations which so far had exercised astrong influence on the judge. And the second concrete requirementwhich I made, and which is contained in my memorandum is that theentire administration of the criminal law [Strafrechtspflege] shouldnot be split up but its entire extent remain with the administrationof justice. In connection with that are some formulations which Imade in my memorandum which state that the political leaders and theofficial of the Gestapo cannot be judges at the same time. A corruptionand hunger for power cannot be prevented in any better way than by astrong personality of a judge. And if I raised such requirements andthen thought about how I could explain these thoughts to a man likeHitler, as I saw him at the time, how can I dare undertake such astep at all, the result of such an attempt was exclusively dependentupon the tactics or the methods which I employed. And therefore, informulating my memorandum, my ideas, I made certain concessions but Ialways added the aim itself immediately afterward. I would like to citetwo cases particularly which the indictment put into the record in thatconnection. First, the following sentence:All clamor about lawlessness, despotism, injustice, et cetera,is at present nothing but a lack of insight into the politicalsituation. And then I continue: The question is solely: Is a strongjudiciary incompatible with the National Socialist authoritarianstate [Fuehrerstaat] _per se_, that is, permanently or onlytemporarily? And another sentence with which I am being charged isthe following: Political situations require constant measures ofopportuneness, and every stubborn resistance to it--on principleor fundamental deliberation--is senseless. And I continue: Butone must be constantly aware of the danger that the very convenientputting aside of a regulated administration of justice conceals the_tendency of habit_--and that last phrase is underlined--Whatcan I do to put at the disposal of the Fuehrer a justice and judges inwhich he may have confidence?Now for me the basic problem existed--how is it possible to makethese ideas of a judiciary at all compatible with the ideas of anauthoritarian state, because the authoritarian state as such was afact for me. I could not overthrow it; and to that extent, of course,there is a difference in regard to the position of the judge which Iaimed at in Germany from the position of a judge in England. For me itwas a fact that Hitler was the man who in Germany combined all powerin his own person, but in order to make the dangers inherent in thisconcentration of power clear to Hitler, I emphasized two factors inparticular in this memorandum.First for one, a historical element. By referring to the Roman Empire,to the British Empire, and to other empires, I pointed out to him onthe basis of history that: Nothing brings about the self-destructionof a state more than the absence of law and a weak judiciary. Thesecond element with which I hoped to convince Hitler was a morenationalist element. I attempted to explain to him the picture whichevery human being makes himself of the position of a judge. I usedthe expression, The original judge and arch judge, and I told himthat the essential characteristics of this arch judge consist of threeconditions.First, that it is a distorted picture if this judge has to ask anotherperson what kind of a decision he should make. The independence of thejudge and his freedom in issuing instruction was the most essentialfeature of a judge in contrast to a civil servant. The second elementwhich I wanted to include in this picture in which I told him thathe has to imagine a court on a market place was that a human beingcan really only imagine that there was just one judge. As soon asone has several judges in one case, one asks, Well, who gives me abetter justice? I said that the symbol for the fact that there is onlyone law and one justice would be blurred. By saying so, of course,I meant that there should be as few judges as possible. The thirdelement which I added to this picture was, and I quote: The judgehas a strong inner authority. He is the interpreter of the law whofrom the point of humaneness, wisdom, and experience must be superiorto all other servants of the State. The fact that Hitler, himself,was the highest legal reviewing authority in Germany was of coursefrom my conception of the dignity and independence of the judiciary,a danger. The question exists anyhow as to whether this idea of theabsolute independence of the judge is compatible with the concept of anauthoritarian state.After I was discharged, and after I had gathered the experience inBerlin during the 15 months that I was there, I absolutely denied thatquestion. I said that those two concepts are not compatible with eachother. At the time when I made this attempt, I believed that theywere compatible, and that the separation of power which is necessaryin every state for the purpose of controlling the people, in practicewould be achieved by my program of having all influences on thejudiciary eliminated.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *Q. Dr. Rothenberger, would you now please tell the court how yourappointment to the post of State Secretary in 1942 came about? In thisconnection I would refer to [1964-PS, Prosecution] Exhibit 65. That isthe authority dated 20 August 1942.A. On 4 August 1942 the Reich Minister and Chief of the ReichChancellery, Lammers, suddenly asked me to come to Berlin for thepurpose of a conference. Lammers told me the Fuehrer had read mymemorandum. He had liked that memorandum, and he would like to havethe plans of that memorandum carried into effect. I asked Lammersspecifically as to whether Hitler had given him any further reasons. Hetold me what had impressed Hitler was the question of the position ofthe judge. His opinion of the judge of the civil servant type was verylow, and he thought that civil servants and judges were strangers topractical life.In reply to my question, Lammers said to me, Hitler is convinced thatthese plans must be carried out. I then said to Lammers that I thoughtduring the war it was altogether impossible to put into effect my plansand I would ask to be allowed to wait with carrying out my plans untilthe end of the war, all the more so as I myself had not yet finished mypreparatory work in Hamburg. Lammers replied that Hitler counted on anearly conclusion of the war, and the preparation for carrying out thereform would need some time after all, and I was to utilize that time.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *_CROSS-EXAMINATION_       *       *       *       *       *       *       *MR. KING: Dr. Rothenberger, I would like to come back toProsecution Exhibit 27, which is Document NG-075. This is yourmemorandum to Hitler, or rather your memorandum which eventuallyreached Hitler, and to which you attribute your appointment to theposition of State Secretary. The purpose of examining certain phrasesfrom this memorandum is to enable me better to understand what yournew program for the independence of the judiciary was. I am sure youknow that memorandum much better than I do. I want to read to youseveral paragraphs from it. You say in one place: Law must serve thepolitical leadership. Then you say in another place on page 8 of thedocument, He who is striving toward a new world order cannot move inthe limitation of an orderly Ministry of Justice. To accomplish sucha far-reaching revolution in domestic and foreign policy it is onlypossible if on one hand all outmoded institutions, concepts, and habitshave been done away with, if need be in a brutal manner. Then you saystill further on, The Fuehrer is the supreme judge, theoretically theauthority to pass judgment is only his. Then you say still furtheron: A judge who is in a direct relation of fealty to the Fuehrer mustjudge like the Fuehrer. All of these phrases which I read appear inthat memorandum and based on them, I want to ask you this and perhapsseveral other questions. You have repeatedly said that the purposeof your program was to establish an independence of the judiciary.However, the essence of your program, as it seems clear to me fromreading your memorandum, is that the Fuehrer is the supreme judge. Asyou say here, theoretically the authority to pass judgment is onlyhis. A judge in a position of direct relation of fealty to the Fuehrermust judge like the Fuehrer. Now my question to you, Dr. Rothenberger,is simply this: When you speak of the independence of the Germanjudiciary, how do you reconcile that with these statements that theFuehrer is the supreme judge, and that only he can actually judge, andthat all judges must reflect his thinking?DEFENDANT ROTHENBERGER: During my direct examination Ihave already tried to explain the thoughts which made me writethis memorandum. It is extraordinarily difficult to do so briefly,especially to state ones attitude only in regard to two or threesentences which are taken out of their context. Therefore, I am of theopinion that the memorandum as such should speak for itself, and thatI leave it up to the Tribunal to form its judgment about the actualthoughts contained in the memorandum. And if in spite of that I mayanswer that question only very briefly in a concrete manner, I haveto say the following: In 1942 the authoritarian state as such was afact in Germany. That is to say, Hitler was also the highest judicialauthority, and if any chance or possibility still existed to removeall the damage which had occurred during the course of years and allthe burdens with which the administration of justice was loaded by theParty and by the SS--or, as we used to say at the time, on the part ofthe thousand little Hitlers who every day jeopardized the independenceof the individual judge--under those conditions the only possibilityto bring about any amelioration at all was Hitler himself. That it wasimpossible to convince Hitler I, and later on, everybody realized. Butat the time I believed that it was possible to convince him, and I hadto seize that possibility as a last chance. And if it would have beenpossible to convince him, then in effect the independence of the courtswould have been reestablished again. For in that case this directrelationship between Hitler and the judiciary which I asked for wouldhave been established and all other influences which burdened everyjudge every day would have been eliminated.Q. Dr. Rothenberger, may I interrupt you at this point? I think thatyou are entirely too modest about the success of your program. If youmeant what you said in your memorandum, and I assume that you did meanwhat you said, then isnt it true that your program was a completesuccess, since the final result was that the Fuehrer became the supremejudge? Isnt that true?A. The fact that after only 15 months I again left my office isprobably the best proof of the fact that my program was a completefailure.Q. Dr. Rothenberger, do you distinguish between the success of yourprogram and your own failure to get along with people in the ministry?Isnt it possible that those two factors are separable?A. No. A second reason also speaks for the assumption that it was acomplete failure--and that is the intervention of outside offices withthe activity of the judges which I wanted to prevent; this did not stopat all after this memorandum was submitted, but rather became worse.The independence of the court and the lifting of the judiciary fromthe civil service, which I was striving for, did not become effectiveat all. I request the Tribunal to tell me whether I should go into moredetail in regard to this problem, which of course is a fundamentalproblem, or whether I should not say any more about it now.PRESIDING JUDGE BRAND: We will not interfere at this time.MR. KING: Dr. Rothenberger, I am frankly puzzled by seeminglycontradictory statements in your memorandum. Lets go over it oncemore. You say, on the one hand, that you want an independent judiciary.You say, on the other, that the Fuehrer is the supreme judge, and alljudges must act like the Fuehrer. Now, unless you meant that all judgesmust act in accordance with the wishes of the Fuehrer, your memorandummeans absolutely nothing and is pure double-talk. If that isnt whatyou meant--if you didnt mean that the Fuehrers decisions should bethe final decisions--just what do you mean by all that talk of theFuehrer being the supreme judge?DEFENDANT ROTHENBERGER: I said in my memorandum thattheoretically the Fuehrer is the highest judge in Germany; I alsoexpressed that the individual judge in his decision must be independenteven in his relationship to the Fuehrer. What I attempted to achievefirst was to eliminate all other influences on the judge and thereforeto establish this direct connection between the Fuehrer and the judge.Therefore, my suggestion in order to say it clearly to put in placeof the influence of Bormann or Himmler, the so-called Judge of theFuehrer, who would influence the Fuehrer in the capacity of a judge,and would therefore not only try to direct the development in Germanyinto quite different channels in a legal respect but in every respect.Q. Let me put this question to you. If, under your program, as youenvisaged it in 1942, a judge came to a decision, and that decision wasknown not to be in accordance with the Fuehrers views, in your viewwhose opinion should have prevailed, as you intended it to work out?A. The decision of the judge.Q. Then what do you mean when you say the judge must judge like theFuehrer?A. The Fuehrer does not have the right to touch a decision made by ajudge.Q. Dr. Rothenberger, we know that that wasnt so in practice, dont we?We have seen instances where it didnt work out that way, havent we?A. Unfortunately, after I wrote this memorandum, especially here inthis trial, and also when I was in Berlin already, I found out thatthe Fuehrer acted in a different way. The purpose of this memorandum,however, was merely the following: to convince the Fuehrer that themen who had influenced him so far and in that direction were wrong. Myknowledge from Hamburg was not sufficient in order to know already atthat time that the Fuehrer himself could not be convinced. But that isnot only my own tragedy, but the tragedy of the entire German people.Q. Did you ever consider the possibility that the Fuehrer in readingyour memorandum read it literally and decided that when you said TheFuehrer should be the supreme judge, that you meant what you said? Didyou ever consider that possibility?A. Yes, I considered that possibility.Q. Do you have any feeling that in practice it didnt work out thatway? In fact, the evidence adduced here at this trial tends to prove,dont you believe, that by the end of the war the Fuehrer really becamethe supreme judge and interfered with all judicial decisions?A. I saw that later, and if I had known that before, I would not haveundertaken this daring attempt, because there was no hope for it fromthe very beginning. But at the time, I thought that as a jurist I wasunder an obligation to make this final attempt, because I just couldnot accept the conditions which existed.Q. You knew what the Party platform was, did you not? You knew whatHitler had said in Mein Kampf, did you not?A. About that problem, he did not say anything in a negative way in hisParty platform and not in Mein Kampf either.Q. Well, as a reasonable man, Dr. Rothenberger, you knew what hisattitudes were on all of these questions, and if your program embodiedhaving him become the supreme judge, you knew fairly well how he wouldjudge on all these questions from your prior knowledge, did you not?A. No. I can only emphasize again and again that as long as I saw thepossibility of influencing him, I considered it my duty to make thisattempt; otherwise I would have been a fool.Q. No one denies that you did influence him, Dr. Rothenberger; theimplication is that you did, and that you were completely successful.A. I did not have any success. That is just it. Hitler could not beconvinced.Q. He became the supreme judge, did he not?A. In effect, he interfered with the administration of justice, as weknow now.Q. All of the judges in Germany were in a position of fealty to theFuehrer, were they not?A. No fealty, no.Q. What do you understand by fealty?A. Dependence upon him.Q. And you dont think judges in Germany at the end of the war weredependent on Hitler?A. I just wanted to prevent this fealty.Q. You wanted to prevent it?A. Yes.Q. That is not what you said in your memorandum. You said in yourmemorandum, A judge who is in direct relation of fealty to the Fuehrermust judge like the Fuehrer. That doesnt sound like you were tryingto prevent it. That sounds like you were trying to induce it.A. You do not distinguish between the dependence and fealty on the onehand, and an obvious natural relationship of trust and confidence whichevery German and therefore every judge too should have in the Fuehrer.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *JUDGE HARDING: Dr. Rothenberger, with reference to the timeyou submitted your memorandum to Albrecht,[268] when did this speech ofHitler declaring himself the supreme law lord of Germany occur?

When did you submit it to Albrecht?A. I can gather that only from the date which is below the memorandumand that is 31 March; in other words, I probably gave the memorandumto Albrecht during the month of April without knowing exactly when itwas and also without knowing when Albrecht succeeded in putting it inHitlers hands. I dont know that.Q. It was submitted to Albrecht before you knew anything about thisspeech of 26 April?A. Yes, that is certain.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *3.

They had a discussion, lasting 5 hours, with theReich Leader, in which also participated on the side of the ReichLeader, SS Gruppenfuehrer Streckenbach (Security Police) and SSObersturmbannfuehrer Bender (SS judge with the Reich Leader SS andChief of the German Police).

Correction [Handwritten insertion: Lammers informed] byspecial treatment at the hands of the police [durch polizeilicheSonderbehandlung] in cases where judicial sentences are not severeenough. On the suggestion of Reichsleiter Bormann, the followingagreement was reached between the Reich Leader SS and myself:_a._ On principle, the Fuehrers time is no longer to be burdenedwith these matters._b._ The Reich Minister of Justice will decide whether and whenspecial treatment [polizeiliche Sonderbehandlung] at the hands of thepolice is to be applied._c._ The Reich Leader SS will send the reports which he hithertosent to Reichsleiter Bormann, to the Reich Minister of Justice._d._ If the views of the Reich Leader SS and those of the ReichMinister of Justice agree, the final decision on the case will restwith them._e._ If their views are not in agreement, Reichsleiter Bormannwill be asked for his opinion, and he will possibly inform the Fuehrer._f._ In cases where the Fuehrers decision on a mild sentence issought through other channels (such as by a letter from a Gauleiter)Reichsleiter Bormann will forward the report to the Reich Minister ofJustice. The case will then be decided as described above by the ReichLeader SS and the Reich Minister of Justice.2. Delivery of asocial elements [asozialer Elemente] while servingpenal sentences to the Reich Leader SS to be worked to death [zurVernichtung durch Arbeit]. Persons under security detention, Jews,gypsies, Russians, and Ukrainians; Poles with more than 3-yearsentences; and Czechs and Germans with more than 8-year sentences, willbe turned over without exception, according to the decision of theReich Minister of Justice. First of all, the worst asocial elementsamong those just mentioned are to be handed over. I shall inform theFuehrer of this through Reichsleiter Bormann.[272]3. Administration of justice by the people--This is to be carried outstep by step as soon as possible, first of all in the villages andthe small towns of up to about 20,000 inhabitants. It is difficult tocarry it out in large towns. I shall rouse the Party particularly tocooperate in this scheme by an article in the Hoheitstraeger. It isevident that jurisdiction must not be permitted to lie in the hands ofthe Party.4. Decrees concerning the police and the administration of justice willin future be published after having been coordinated, for example, incases where unmarried mothers attempting to procure abortion are notprosecuted.5. The Reich Leader SS agrees that the cancellation of sentence,even for members of the police, will remain with the Reich Ministerof Justice as laid down in article 8 of the law relating to thecancellation of sentence.6. The Reich Leader SS has given full consent to the ruling I haveplanned on corporal punishment ordered by the Fuehrer.7. I refer to the law concerning asocial elements and give notificationof the claims of the administration of justice, e.g., in theclassification of juveniles as asocial elements and their direction.It likewise seems to me that the actual circumstances which serveto classify a person as asocial are not laid down in the law withsufficient clarity. The Reich Leader SS is awaiting our opinion andwill desist from submission of the law until then.   [Handwritten] One thing is clear--the reduction of the age of   discretion has been tentatively submitted to, and approved by   the competent agencies.8. The Reich Leader SS has agreed to a clause for the Juvenile CourtLaw, whereby the age of discretion can be reduced to 12 years and theage of limited discretion can be extended to over 18 years.9. SS Lieutenant Colonel Bender, on the staff of the Reich Leader SS,is appointed by the Reich Leader SS as liaison officer for matterswhich apparently necessitate direct liaison with the Reich LeaderSS. He can be contacted at any time by teleprinter at the fieldheadquarters of the Reich Leader SS, and will also come to Berlin onceevery month to report to me. SS Captain Wanniger is appointed liaisonofficer for other matters; he is stationed at the Reich Security MainOffice.   [Handwritten] Kuemmerlein[273]10. The Reich Leader SS points out that in the administration ofpunishment many more special institutions should be set up, followingthe principle that incorrigible criminals should be confinedseparately, and that those capable of improvement should be separatedaccording to the nature of their crimes (e.g., embezzlers, thieves,and those who committed acts of violence). This is recognized as beingcorrect.11. The Reich Leader SS demands that the penal register be kept bythe police. Arguments against this are to be examined (cancellation,aggravation, and the use of an extract from the penal register). Thequestion is to be further discussed with SS Major General Streckenbach.12. The Reich Leader SS points out SS First Lieutenant, Judge at theReich Supreme Court, Altstoetter, at present on active service as amajor, as being reliable and also District Court President Stepp; heconsiders Attorney General Jung in Dresden unreliable.13. Finally, the Reich Leader SS broaches the subject of the office ofthe public prosecutor and its transfer to the police. I rejected itflatly. There was no further discussion of this subject.14. It is agreed that in consideration of the intended aims of thegovernment for the clearing up of the eastern problems in future Jews,Poles, gypsies, Russians, and Ukrainians are no longer to be tried bythe ordinary courts as far as punishable offenses are concerned, butare to be dealt with by the Reich Leader SS. This does not apply tocivil lawsuits, nor to Poles whose names are registered for or enteredin the lists of ethnic Germans.

So, as a general rule the [Ministry of]Justice is not at all informed of the work which is being carried outby the Security Service and is therefore also not in the position torequest information.

Moreover, I know from documents, which the minister produces fromtime to time out of his private files, that the Security Servicetakes up special problems of the administration of justice withthoroughness and makes summarized situation reports about them. Asfar as I am informed, a member of the Security Service is attached toeach judicial authority. This member is obliged to give informationunder the seal of secrecy. The procedure is secret and the personwho gives the information is not named. In this way we get, so tosay, anonymous reports. Reasons given for this procedure are ofState political interest. As long as direct interests of the Statesecurity are concerned, nothing can be said against it, especiallyin wartime. Moreover, as far as for instance evaluation of personnelof less important nature, questions concerning the judiciary orgeneral reports on public opinion are concerned, I do not regard theanonymity as harmless. The danger exists, that people will be trainedto snoop around, that unjustified denunciations will occur and that anatmosphere of mistrust will be created. There can indeed be no questionof cooperation between the [Ministry of] Justice and the SecurityService curing such a procedure. On the other hand the minister may beinterested to know how the [Ministry of] Justice is criticized outsidethe official channels of appeals. In any case the secret, one-sidedSecurity Service reports cannot be a basis for the establishment offacts and certain conclusions. They may provide hints.Berlin, 29 October 1943                         [Signature] LETZ[Marginal note] to IVa 2745/43g    PARTIAL TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT NG-327    PROSECUTION EXHIBIT 359LETTER FROM LAMMERS TO THIERACK, 23 OCTOBER 1942, STATING THAT THEOPINION OF THE GAULEITER HAS TO ACCOMPANY CLEMENCY CASES SUBMITTED TOHITLERThe Reich Minister and Chief of the Reich Chancellery,Rk. 779 B g        [Stamp]Reich Ministry of Justice    25 October 1942                                            Berlin W 8, 23 October 1942                                            Voss Strasse 6 at present,                                            Field Headquarters                                SECRETTo the Reich Minister of Justice, Dr. Thierack                                       [Handwritten] has been submitted                                               [Signed] EBERSBERGSubject: Consultation of Gauleiter in clemency casesDear Mr. Thierack!The Fuehrer ordered that in future in all cases submitted to him forclemency, the expression of opinion by the Gauleiter[276] has to beobtained.

WANDSCHNEIDER (counsel for defendant Rothenberger): Weare now coming to a group of problems which were set down in Exhibits38 and 39.[278] The exhibits are concerned with a discussion betweenHimmler and Thierack, in the presence of Dr. Rothenberger, as is saidat the beginning of the transcript of 18 September. Dr. Rothenberger,would you tell us, please, who was your main opponent outside theadministration of justice?DEFENDANT ROTHENBERGER: Himmler, as the Reich Leader SS.That he was my opponent I had known for many years. I gathered thaton the one hand from the fact that at public demonstrations I hadrepeatedly in view against all measures which had been taken againstthe administration of justice at the instigation of Himmler.In particular, I remind you of the measures described in the SchwarzeKorps against the German judges. I remind you of his measures whichamounted to a correction of sentences. It was natural that the viewwhich I had expressed in public as to what those measures would leadto, that Himmler through the SD service would have been informed ofthat. For me it was a matter of course, that Himmler would have beeninformed of the contents of my memorandum to Hitler, and that wasproved right during the discussion later on. About that discussionHimmler knew that I had warned Hitler of the development of theadministration of justice and of the development of the Reich as awhole, a development towards becoming a pure power state.In particular Himmler knew from the memorandum[279] that I hadrequested that the entire administration of penal justice was to lieexclusively in the hands of the judiciary. That that constituted acamouflaged attack on the administration of justice by the Gestapo wasnaturally obvious to Himmler. That view of mine, namely, that Himmlerfor that reason harbored great distrust toward me, was confirmed to menot in the course of the discussion, but it was confirmed to me by theresults of that discussion; and it was confirmed without any doubt. Isaw Himmler once in my life and for the following reason:He had sent out an invitation. Thierack said to me that I was to goalong with him because it was a first official visit. We had only justassumed office and this was supposed to be my first official call onHimmler. We had not heard before what points were to be discussedthere. One could only rely on suppositions. My supposition was thatthe problems which for years had been an object of dispute between theadministration of justice and the police would probably be mentionedin the course of this discussion. Among those problems there were, inparticular, the following questions:On the one hand, the question of the transfer of the prosecution to thepolice, which has been mentioned here a few times, but the significanceof which, I believe requires some explanation. I mean, it issignificant for the entire set of proceedings and trials in Germany.The German prosecution at this trial here has repeatedly been describedas the most objective authority in the world. Naturally, that was anexaggerated expression. But contrary to the Anglo-American procedure,what is correct about that statement is that the public prosecutor,because he has to deal with all elements that speak in favor of thedefendant as well, constitutes a very far-reaching protective elementfor the defendant as well.This is therefore for the entire method of proceedings, the positionof the judge and in particular also the position of the defensecounsel--which for that reason, too, is an entirely different positionthan it is under Anglo-American procedure--of essential importance.If Himmler would have gotten the prosecution into his hands, whichhe had wanted to do for years, that agency which hitherto had beenobjective would have been in Himmlers hands. Himmlers struggleagainst the administration of justice would have been carried intothe courtroom. That explains my great misgivings against that demandof Himmlers. For this reason, as far as I knew this problem wouldbecome acute, I considered it my duty, although formally it did notconcern me, but because it was a basic question for the reputationof the judiciary as such, I tried with all means at my disposal topersuade Thierack before the discussions that on no account was he togive way on that point. I had all the more cause to do so because Ihad the feeling that Thierack wavered on that point. I did not know, Ionly heard that here, that actually on the occasion of the Elias casewhich has been mentioned here, in Czechoslovakia he in a certain wayhad already committed himself. I made particular use of this factorwithout Thierack--I told him that if the prosecution would no longerbe under the administration of justice, you yourself, who directs thepenal administration of justice, will lose the ground under your feet.What I said was, you yourself will saw off the branch on which youare sitting. That factor evidently did have some effect upon him; itevidently succeeded.The second problem which would probably be broached by Himmler was thequestion of the community law concerning asocials, which has alreadybeen mentioned. I shall refer to that briefly later, because thatproblem was discussed during the conference.There were two further points which I thought would be broached. Theywere old hobby horses of my own. I am referring to the question ofthe Schwarze Korps and that of the correction of sentences. Thierackhimself said to me before the conference on the way there--we wentthere together--Will you keep in the background at the conference,please, because, on the one hand, the problems will probably concernmatters which do not affect you, that is to say, matters of theadministration of penal justice; and furthermore, I do not wantan argument to arise between us again, which is quite apparent tooutsiders, such as occurred during our visit to Lammers a month ago.Q. What happened at the conference itself?A. It is nearly 5 years ago now since that conference took place, butas it was very impressive I believe I can remember it fairly well. Itwas not a formal meeting, since only a very small circle of peopleattended. It was, in fact, an informal conversation, interrupted by asupper. Himmler was the main speaker. I noticed this manner of speakingwas very much like that of Hitlers.PRESIDING JUDGE BRAND: Wouldnt it be possible for you toconcentrate a little more on the actual material features of theconversation?DEFENDANT ROTHENBERGER: Yes.Q. We dont care how he spoke, or about his manner.A. Yes, Your Honor.To begin with, he made general remarks about the war situation, ofwhich he took a favorable view. I do not remember now the sequenceof the individual points which are mentioned in the minutes, butI do believe that he then immediately went over to the subject ofthe transfer of prisoners, that is to say, the transfer from theadministration of justice to the police. That was a problem which wasentirely new to me. He said that through his organizations he had hadthe facts established that the prisoners under the administration ofjustice, on the one hand, were badly overcrowded, and furthermorethat in some cases at those prisons, work was still being performedwhich was not essential to the war effort. He mentioned handicraft andpasting together of paper bags. He himself, on the other hand, hadconstructed large armament works. He was of the opinion that at a timewhen every German, be it the soldier at the front or the man or womanin the homeland, was working for the war efforts, the prisoners too,in one form or another, should make their contribution toward the wareffort.When he had explained that to us in great detail, it seemed to me thatThieracks attitude on that point was not altogether clear. On thecontrary, I had the impression that Thierack had understanding for thatrequest which Himmler had put forward.No details were discussed as to what type of prisoner Himmler wantedtransferred, but it was said in a general way that only prisoners withlong terms would be considered for such transfer, since prisoners withshort terms would have to be discharged again at an early date.I myself kept silent on that point to begin with, because for onething I did not feel certain on that question, and secondly, becauseThierack had especially asked me to hold back. However, in the courseof our talk--I do not remember whether it was immediately or whetherit was later on--the conversation turned to the subject of the generalrelations between the administration of justice and the police. Thatconversation dealt mainly with the old arguments concerning theSchwarze Korps and Himmlers correction of sentences. Himmler was ofthe opinion that the administration of justice had failed in variousinstances, and for that reason he had been compelled to intervene.Since Thierack, on that point too, did not take up a clear attitudein favor of the administration of justice, I considered it my duty tointerfere. Naturally, I was cautious in my manner, but I was clearas far as the matter itself was concerned. I had just been appointedby Hitler and had the belief that Hitler was backing up my plans. Isaid that the problem of the police and the administration of justicecould not be considered just from the point of view of one singlesentence which might have been correct or incorrect, but that one mustregard that problem from the general point of view of the reputationof the judiciary. I said that the reputation of the State as such wasdependent upon the reputation of the judiciary.In speaking of these things I referred to my memorandum and my opinionthat Hitler had approved my memorandum on those points, too. I saidthat from that point of view I, too, considered it incorrect for theadministration of justice to transfer prisoners to the police. If theprisoners were not being put to sufficient use for the war effort,the administration of justice itself would have to see to it thatsufficient use would be made of such prisoners.Himmler listened to my remarks with comparative calm. It seemed to methat he had understanding for what I was saying.He said that he had never heard of these problems from that angle, andhe said that in future he would instruct the Schwarze Korps to refrainfrom attacking the administration of justice; he would also stop thepolice from intervening in the case of individual sentences.These two subjects had thus been concluded. The question of thetransfer of prisoners seemed to me to remain undecided. Besides thatpoint a few other problems were discussed, for example, the question ofthe asocial law.Q. I wonder, would you for my convenience tell me the technical name ofthe asocial law, either by date or in any other way? What law are youreferring to as the asocial law?A. May it please the Court, that is not a law in the sense of everhaving become a law. It is merely a draft which dealt with the questionas to whether the police were to be allowed to arrest asocial elements.Have I made myself clear, Your Honor?Q. In saying the asocial law, you didnt mean that there was any lawat all?A. No, no, I did not. No, it never became law. I will explain that ina moment. I was familiar with that problem from my time in Hamburg.Yesterday I explained, as is evident from Document NG-387, ProsecutionExhibit 400,[280] that I had put forward the proposal that if such alaw were to be issued at all, a judicial authority would have to be setup in order to decide as to who, in fact, was an asocial element. Thatsame question was brought to my attention immediately when I assumedoffice in Berlin. I believe it was in my first or second week therewhen a Ministerialdirigent Rietsch came to see me. He said to me--Mr.Under Secretary, you must help us. Minister Thierack is prepared toagree to that law, and that would be impossible, because that law wouldgive to the police alone the right to determine who is an asocialelement. Since a large number of the criminal elements are also asocialelements, such a regulation, that is to say if the police were tohave the right to determine who was asocial, that would mean that thepenal courts would be completely eliminated. Together with Rietsch,before the conference at Himmlers, I had had a lengthy conversationwith Thierack on the matter, because this problem again constituted afundamental question of the administration of justice. Thierack didnot give his approval, even when Himmler broached that question at theconference and asked Thierack to give his consent, Thierack remainedfirm. That is evident from item No. 7 of the document. As I heard lateron, negotiations were held between the Referenten, and the law neverbecame a law in effect, at least not during my period of office, and Ido not believe that it became effective afterwards. The further pointwhich was discussed was the problem which I think has been discussedin almost too much detail here, that of the justice of the peace. Itwas astonishing and surprising to me that Himmler had any interest atall in that problem. He was fairly well informed about the historicalfoundations both abroad and in Germany, and it was equally surprisingto me that he concurred in my opinion--I talked about that subject, myopinion being that the office of the justice of the peace was not tolie in the hands of the Party. That is evident from item No. 3 of thedocument.Various other questions were discussed at length, questions which werelargely of a technical nature, partly anyhow. I do not remember theorder in which these questions came up for discussion. I am merelymentioning the question of age in regard to responsibility beforethe law [Strafmuendigkeit]. I believe that Himmler mentioned a fewcases where children of only 13 years of age had committed punishableacts and where he was of the opinion that one had to punish them,whereas under the previously existing legislation a child only becomespunishable at the age of 14. Questions concerning the penal registerwere then discussed, concerning ordinances to be issued jointly by theadministration of justice and the police. I do not remember for certainwhether punishment by flogging was discussed in my presence. I think itis possible. I am certain that while I was there the question of thetransfer of the prosecution was not touched upon at all. This documentcontains a reference under 13 where Thierack says I flatly rejectedHimmlers demand for the transfer of the prosecution to the police.DR. WANDSCHNEIDER: Dr. Rothenberger, may I interrupt youbefore we continue? When you spoke about the correction of sentencesyou said that the correction of sentences, according to Himmlersremarks, was to be stopped. The document of 18 September 1942 itselfshows that beyond that a number of details were laid down as to whatprocedure was to be adopted in correcting sentences, concerning therelation between Himmler and Thierack and with the correspondingparticipation of Bormann. Were such particulars discussed in yourpresence?DEFENDANT ROTHENBERGER: No. Himmler merely emphasized that aunilateral interference such as has occurred hitherto would no longerbe permitted by him.Q. Would you continue, please?A. The last point which is contained in the document was also certainlynot discussed at all. I am referring to the question of the transfer ofthe penal administration of justice concerning Jews, Poles, gypsies,Russians, and Ukrainians.Q. Dr. Rothenberger, you know the transcript of 18 September, thoseminutes where it says that Himmler and Thierack led the discussion andthat you were present. How can you explain it that those points which,according to you, were not mentioned in your presence must have beenkept secret from you or deliberately cannot have been discussed in yourpresence?A. The file note which Thierack wrote personally I saw for the firsttime here.[281] Today it is altogether clear to me how that file notecame about.Added to the file note in NG-059[282] is a notation signed by Ficker,Reich Cabinet Counsellor.That notation confirms that following the conference which I attended,the Reich Minister of Justice and Reich Leader SS, I quote, had aprivate conversation. When I think it over as to why such a talkbetween the two alone took place, today I realize fully that Himmlerand Thierack quite deliberately excluded me and misled me, inparticular, concerning the most delicate points.What their motives were, I naturally cant say but in accordancewith all the previous and subsequent events, immediately after theconference, I am bound to assume that Himmler and Thierack did notexactly regard me as their ally in such plans, and that during thefirst conference which I attended, they quite deliberately created theimpression that they were making certain concessions. As to whetherthey, themselves, were not certain of themselves, as to whether Hitlerreally had a certain amount of understanding for my plans I cannottell of course; but as far as the early period is concerned, thatis possible. And now Thierack, I do not know when, for it cannot beseen from the file note (_654-PS, Pros. Ex. 39_), which bears nodate, summarized the results of both discussions; that is to say, theconference which I attended and the following conversation betweenHimmler and Thierack alone, in this file note, without differentiatingbetween them. It seems that a part of this file note was added by himonly at a later time. I gather so from the original document, accordingto which some of the document was added later on by a differenttypewriter. That part concerns the last item, point 14, the question ofthe transfer of the administration of penal justice over Jews and Poles.Q. Dr. Rothenberger, may I put another question to you in thisconnection? If I understood you rightly, you wanted to tell us thatThierack and Himmler were uncertain toward you and did not quite knowwhere they stood with you. To what do you attribute that feeling thatthey had, that they did not quite know where they stood with you?A. Mainly I think that feeling was caused by my memorandum. I assumedthat Himmler knew that memorandum and that Himmler was not certainwhether Hitler was really supporting the ideas of that memorandum.Q. Did the unusual way in which you came to Hitler play any part inthat?A. No doubt, for Himmler and Thierack both knew that I had beenappointed by Hitler himself in an unusual manner.PRESIDING JUDGE BRAND: You have covered that.DR. WANDSCHNEIDER: Thank you. May it please the Tribunal, mayI continue with my examination?PRESIDING JUDGE BRAND: Yes.DR. WANDSCHNEIDER: What was your first impression after theconference?DEFENDANT ROTHENBERGER: My first impression after theconference was favorable. Immediately after the conference, I toldReich Cabinet Councilor Ficker so. That too can be seen from DocumentNG-059, Prosecution Exhibit 38. I believed that that favorableimpression was due to the fact that in regard to the main problems ofthe administration of justice, Himmler had not prevailed with his view.He had not asked to have the prosecution transferred. Concerning thecorrection of sentences and that of the Schwarze Korps, he had givenassurances, in the problem of the asocial law, too, he had withdrawnhis demand, and the question of the transfer of prisoners had at anyrate remained open.After the conference, the next morning in fact, I left by myself.Thierack remained behind--I do not know for how long he stayed. I wentto Hamburg via Berlin to join my family in Hamburg, and there, too, Italked to a friend in a very positive way about this very importantmeeting which had concerned the administration of justice. When Ireturned to Berlin, the great disappointment began. Already after a fewdays, there was among the files which lay on my desk, a paper. That,too, was a file note by Thierack. It was a much briefer file note thanthe one here. As I remember it now, it concerned a conference withGoebbels. That file note indicated, in what form I do not remember now,that Goebbels had voiced to Thierack the idea of the exterminationthrough work. That file note, was not addressed to me. It must havecome into my possession by mistake.When I read it, I could hardly comprehend that idea to start with.I could not comprehend what was meant by it. Feeling upset, I wentupstairs to see Thierack immediately and asked him what it was allabout. Thierack said to me with a certain amount of arrogance andcondescension, Do not get excited. It is correct that I talked toHimmler alone afterwards, that was the first time I heard of it, and inthe course of that talk, this question, too, was discussed by Himmlerand myself. But I rejected that demand on the part of Himmler withdetermination. I did that for humane reasons alone, and Himmler toounderstood that at the time everybody in Germany was needed.During that talk, Thierack took a paper out of his desk, and on thispaper--which I did not read myself, but I could see it--Thierack wrotein the margin so that I could see it, in his green pencil, Settled orRejected. I believe it was settled, as I can see now. Evidently, hewanted to confirm to me his assertion that this idea of exterminationby work had been dropped by writing down that remark. I had only beenin office for 3 weeks at that time, and I was still so innocent that Idid not realize that those men might really carry out such an idea, andthat they were deluding me.Q. Dr. Rothenberger, in connection with this group of questions, anumber of documents have been submitted about which you will have togive us your views. I now want to enumerate the various documents andto ask you to give us your views.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *We are now going to deal with Exhibit 264,[283] document book 4-A, page42, that is a letter from the Reich Ministry of Justice to the generalprosecutors, dated 22 October 1942, it is signed by Crohne, and it wasconnected with the carrying out of the agreement of September 1942.A. I never saw the letter either, which was natural, because it was aproblem which concerned penal law and the administration of penalties.Such matters were not submitted to me, on principle.Q. As Exhibit 268,[284] the prosecution submitted a document whichwas signed by Dr. Eichler, and is dated 1 April 1943; it concerns thetransfer of Jews, Poles, etc., into concentration camp. Did you everhear of such a letter?A. No, I never saw that letter either.Q. Finally, a gruesome letter from Thierack to Bormann, dated 13October 1942, plays a part. That letter was read into the record andwas not submitted as a separate document--if I remember correctly.The court knows it, did you ever see this letter from Thierack of 13October 1942?[285]A. No, I do not know that letter either.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *Q. And then at the end of 1943, how did your leaving the Reich Ministryof Justice come about?A. Yesterday I briefly mentioned the fact that as early as in April of1943, after Thierack had tried to transfer me to the Reich SupremeCourt in January but had stated that the time was not yet ripe forthat, at that time I offered him my resignation which he rejected.Furthermore, I had mentioned that at the same time that did not keephim from starting investigation proceedings against me the same timeof that year 1943 without my knowledge for the allegedly illegalprocurement of furniture. That Thierack was primarily interested ingetting rid of me in a manner which would give the impression to theoutside world that I was being dishonorably discharged is proved bywhat I shall say briefly about my finally leaving the office.Yesterday I also mentioned the fact that Thierack, as early asSeptember 1942, kept my book for about 3 months. The German_Judge_--PRESIDING JUDGE BRAND: You need not repeat what you saidyesterday; we remember it. Go on to something new.DEFENDANT ROTHENBERGER: Yes. After Thierack had finally turnedover this manuscript to the Party Chancellery and after it had beenexamined there for about 6 months, about in August or September--Iam not quite sure about that date any more--of 1943 an SD report wasreceived in the Ministry. Thierack put that SD report to me, and hetold me it could be seen from that SD report that a plagiarism wascontained in that book. That book contained a short historical reviewof the position of the judge in the old Germanic and Franconian era,and several sentences concerning that era were allegedly taken froma book by a Professor Fehr. Professor Fehr, Thierack told me, wasan emigree, who lived in Switzerland, and a democrat; and there wasconcern that one day the London broadcasting station might broadcastthe information that the German reform of the administration ofjustice really emanated from an emigree who was a democrat and livedin Switzerland. He said that was extremely dangerous from the point ofview of foreign policy, and that I had to clear it up.I did not know the name Fehr at that time at all. As can be seenfrom the preface, a considerable number of my assistants in Hamburghad participated in the work on this book, and one of these assistantsdealt with the historical part of the book. One year before, when nomention was made about the possibility of publishing that book, he hadcompiled that historical data for me, which I needed for a lecture thatI was supposed to give in the Reich Ministry of Justice. The other dayI stated that in August of 1941 I gave a lecture in the Reich Ministryof Justice about the segregation of the profession of judges from theusual civil servant class. That historical compilation was made forthat purpose.I had the matter clarified by that assistant, Dr. Brueckmann, and hesaid yes, that was correct, he had used several sentences from a bookby Professor Fehr compiling the data, without having any opportunity atthat time to know that it would lead to publication.Thereupon, I told Thierack what the causes for that oversight hadbeen. At no time did anybody, not even Thierack, make the assertionthat there was any guilt on anyones part. But I told him the man whocould be interested to see that some sentences of a general historiccontent such as could be found in any book, that such sentences wouldbe also contained in my book would only be Professor Fehr. Therefore, Iwrote a letter to Professor Fehr, explained it to him, and asked him ifthat should be necessary for an interview; and before that conferencetook place--it was intended to take place in January 1944--Thieracksucceeded in having me dismissed, and that in the following manner: Iwas just on a duty trip at the beginning of December 1943. During thattime he went to Lammers and reported to Lammers that an applicationhad been made by professors of the city of Hamburg who, he said, hadcomplained that I was still in office. That in other words, would havebeen colleagues of mine, because I myself was a professor at Hamburg atone time. He added that from the point of view of foreign policy onecould no longer maintain the responsibility of keeping me in office,and therefore, he asked that Lammers should suggest my dismissal toHitler. I was informed about that at the end of December 1943, thatis to say, before that conference with Fehr was to take place. At theend of 1943 I was suddenly called on the telephone--I was at that timewith my family, it was during Christmas--[and told] that I had to cometo Berlin immediately and take Thieracks place temporarily because hewanted to join his wife. Thierack called me into his office and toldme, Hitler has directed that you be dismissed. Upon my question,Why, he answered that the matter with Fehr had gone so far on accountof the application made by the professors from Hamburg that it was nolonger bearable to keep me. I told him that he himself didnt believethat, and I wanted to leave the room. Thereupon suddenly he becamevery friendly and soft and told me, why, of course the matter of thatbook was just the external pretense, but first of all, in the courseof this year and a quarter, I had never succeeded in establishing goodrelations with the Party Chancellery and the SS. Moreover he said Iwas accused of having taken part in the funeral of Guertner, which Ididnt understand at all, how anybody could be so stupid to charge onewith having attended the funeral of an extremely decent former ReichMinister of Justice. I replied if these are the real reasons, thenI was proud of it. Before I left him he again lied to me by saying,yes, he would have liked very much to nominate me for the position ofpresident of the Reich Supreme Court, but Lammers had raised oppositionagainst that. Then a few days later I saw Lammers in order to inquireabout the background of the story. Lammers told me just the opposite.It was he, he said, who tried to offer some office of some kind tome, but Thierack had been the person who rejected that. Through thesecircumstances the separation which had been pending for a long timeactually took place, and without a new office, without gratitude,and without any compensation of any kind I left. And in accordancewith that was the publication in all German newspapers where thefollowing notice appeared, and I quote: Change of office in the ReichMinistry of Justice. Upon the suggestion made by the Reich Minister ofJustice the Fuehrer, after effecting the transfer of Under SecretaryRothenberger, into Wartestand [Civil Service inactive status] hasappointed Ministerialdirektor Klemm, who up to that time was in theParty Chancellery, Under Secretary in the Ministry of Justice.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *      b.

The judge mustremain independent in order to be able to carry the full personalresponsibility for his decisions. I therefore cannot order him to usea certain legal interpretation but only try to convince him how he canhelp the nation by correcting or regulating with the aid of the law alife that has gotten into disorder or is ripe to be brought into order.In this respect the profession of the judge and that of the physicianare akin--he gives aid to the compatriot who asks him for help and thusprevents damage to the community. The judge, like a physician, must beable to eliminate the seat of a disease or perform operations like asurgeon.This conception of the duties of the administration of justice hasalready been accepted by the German jurists to a great extent. Itspractical conclusions, however, have not been fully applied yet in thefield of the administration of justice.To aid the judge in fulfilling his high duty in the life of ourpeople, I have decided to publish the Judges Letters. They shall bedistributed to all German judges and public prosecutors. These judgesletters will contain decisions, which I consider to be especiallyworthwhile mentioning on account of result or argumentation. With thesedecisions I intend to show how a better decision could or should havebeen found; on the other hand good, and for the national communityimportant, decisions shall be cited as examples.The judges letters are not meant to create a new casuistry, whichwould lead to a further ossification of the administration of justiceand to a guardianship over the judges. They are rather aimed at tellinghow judicial authorities think National Socialist justice should beapplied and thereby give the judge the inner security and freedom tocome to the right decision.The contents of these letters are confidential; the chief of an officeshall keep them personally, and let every judge and public prosecutortake notice of them against receipt.For the publication of the Judges Letters the collaboration of allthe judges and prosecutors is needed. I expect suitable decisions fromall branches of justice to be presented to me for publication. Whenpublished, neither the judge nor the tribunal pronouncing the sentencewill be named.I am convinced that the Judges Letters will help essentially to adjustthe administration of justice uniformly along National Socialist lines.

THIERACK                                    [Certified]: [Signed] MASSMUND        [Stamp]                            As Chief Secretary of theThe Reich Ministry of Justice              Ministerial Chancery    PARTIAL TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT NG-298    PROSECUTION EXHIBIT 81        THE FIRST ISSUE OF THE JUDGES LETTERS, 1 OCTOBER 1942         RICHTERBRIEFE [Judges Letters] Communications of the        Reich Minister of Justice, Issue No. 1, 1 October 1942                            _Confidential_                             German JudgesAccording to ancient Germanic interpretation of the law, the leader ofthe nation has always been its supreme judge. When the leader thereforeinvests another person with the authority of a judge, this means thatthe latter not only derives his judicial power from the leader and isresponsible to him, but also that leadership and judgeship have relatedcharacters.The judge is therefore also the guardian of national self-preservation.He is the protector of the values of the nation and helps in theannihilation of the unworthy. He regulates those functions of life,which are considered diseases in the body of the nation. Justicesvested with absolute authority are essential for maintaining a truenational community.On account of this task, the judge is the direct assistant of theleadership of the State. This position renders him prominent, but alsoshows the limits of his tasks which cannot, as a liberal doctrineassumed, lie in the supervision of the leadership of the State. For,if a state does not have an organization which grants the leadershipto the best, the administration of justice cannot substitute thisselection by its activity.The judge is the embodiment of the wide-awake conscience of the nation.Any state is bound to fall if honesty and common sense do not form thestandard of values in the national community. It is the task of thejudge to see that this is done. In rendering judgment he must alwaysshow the people his adherence to this rule.These tasks place the judge in the center of the administration ofjustice. They show the profession of judges as one of the earliestprofessions--to be compared with that of the farmer and the soldier.These tasks can only be fulfilled by men who are mentally free andhonest, and who possess a high sense of responsibility, shoulderingthis responsibility gladly, and conforming by their inner and outerbearing to the picture of a judge as the German people see it. Thejudges must therefore become a corps of judges, which represent anelite of the nation. But this must not lead to the judge keeping alooffrom the people; on the contrary he has to live with and among hispeople and know its needs and sorrows in order to be able to help.Such a corps of judges will not slavishly cling to the letter of thelaw. It will not anxiously look for cover by the law, but aware of itsresponsibility, it will find within the bounds of the law a decisionwhich shall be the best guide for the life of the community.The war for instance makes demands on a judge, which are totallydifferent from those in quiet peace times. The judge has to adapthimself to these changes. He can only do this when he knows theintentions and aims of the State leadership. The judge must thereforealways be in close contact with the leadership of the State. Thisis the only way to guarantee the performance of his high task forthe good of the community, and it prevents the administrationof justice--detached from its real problems in the life of thepeople--from being considered as a body for its own ends. From thisensues the meaning and necessity for the guidance of the administrationof justice.Guidance in the administration of justice does not mean to imposeupon the judges a certain view of the law. The judge must remainindependent, otherwise he will no longer be judge. But the State canand must lay down the general line of policy, which judges must follow,if the administration of justice shall fulfill its obligations.I have therefore decided to issue Richterbriefe which will be sentto all German judges and public prosecutors. These Judges Lettersshall mainly contain decisions which I deem to be especially worthyof interest, because of their findings or argumentation. By thesedecisions I want to show how better findings could and ought to havebeen arrived at; on the other hand, good decisions which are essentialto the community shall be held out as exemplary.There is yet another consideration, which caused me to issue theseJudges Letters--The outlined view of the judges tasks has carriedits point with most of the German lawyers, its practical effects on theadministration of justice, however, has not yet been totally realizedand cannot have been fully realized yet in view of the traditionaltraining of lawyers. Therefore, I want to help the judge by means ofthe Judges Letters to accomplish his high duties in the life of ournation. I want to impress upon him how he must help and protect thecommunity.The Judges Letters are not intended to create a new cult of decisions,which would lead to further formalism in the administration of justiceand to subjecting the judges to tutelage. They are only to give an ideaof how the leadership of justice wishes to apply National Socialistlaw, in order to give the judge self-confidence and freedom to find theright decision.The contents of the letters are confidential; they are handed to eachjudge and public prosecutor by the chief against receipt.I am convinced that the Judges Letters will essentially contribute tothe creation of a uniformly directed German corps of judges.Berlin, 1 October 1942                                         [Signed] DR.

PUBLIC ENEMIES, ESPECIALLY BLACK-OUT OFFENDERS[286]      Sentences imposed by several courts in the years 194119421. A 19-year-old laborer who had been employed by the Reichsbahn [ReichRailroad] since 1941, stole, soon after his appointment in the winterof 19411942, during black-out hours, luggage and parcels from theluggage vans of long distance trains, and parcels from mail vans. Therewere in total 21 charges against him.The Special Court sentenced him to 4 years imprisonment as a publicenemy.2. A 34-year-old lathe operator attempted black-out purse snatchingat the end of 1941. In the darkness he approached a woman in thestreet and snatched her handbag off her arm. He was followed andarrested. He has six previous convictions against him, among whichwas theft, inflicting bodily harm, and killing by negligence. He hadbeen sentenced in respect of the bodily harm, because in 1931 he hadtogether with a Communist knocked down a National Socialist with afence pole.The Special Court did not legally appraise the act as street robberybut as theft, because the woman carried the handbag only loose onher arm, so that the culprit did not have to use force. It regardedhim nevertheless as a public enemy, and expressed the view, that thecommunity should be specially protected against him. Yet the sentenceimposed was but 2 years imprisonment.3. A 29-year-old laborer, who was a shirker and had several previousconvictions against him, tried in 1941 to commit black-out pursesnatching. He had just been discharged from the hospital as amalingerer and wanted to provide himself with money. He followed twowomen in the darkness in the street and reached for the purse whilepassing them, but he could not pull it off, because it was heldtightly. In answer to cries for help, some men hurried to the scene andgot hold of the culprit.The Special Court sentenced him to death as a public enemy, and added,that persons needed special protection during the black-out in order toretain the feeling of safety in the country for the people.4. An 18-year-old culprit W., who had no previous convictions againsthim raped a soldiers wife during the black-out in 1941. After havingvisited an inn, he accosted, about midnight while on the way home withhis 19-year-old friend P., a young woman who was going home from workat that late hour. She rejected the men and said that her husband wasa soldier at the front and that she wished to go home without beingmolested. W. hit a man, who was standing nearby and who witnessed theincident, several times in the face without cause. Then he dragged thewoman into a lane, hit her, and raped her on a bench, breaking herresistance by pretending to have a revolver on him. P. was waitingnearby in the meantime but did not interfere.The Special Court sentenced W. as a public enemy to death for rape.P. was convicted to 5 years imprisonment for aiding and abetting thecriminal.               Opinion of the Reich Minister of JusticeAt a time when the best men of the nation are risking their lives atthe front, and the nation is untiringly working for victory, thereis no room for criminals who destroy this will of the community. Thelawyers therefore must realize that during the war it is their dutyto exterminate the traitors and saboteurs on the home front. The lawoffers enough expedients for this. The home country is responsibleto the front for peace, quiet, and order in the land. This highresponsibility lies not least of all, in the hands of the judge. Inprinciple, every crime counts more gravely in wartime than in peace.The special struggle, however, is against the public enemies aconcept closely confined by the law. When a judge after carefulexamination of the punishable offense and of the personality of theaccused decided that a criminal is to be considered a public enemy,this serious decision must also be expressed with full severity bythe sentence. It is self-evident that a thief who steals goods andproperty from fellow citizens after the terror raids of our enemiesdeserves death only. But any other culprit too who commits crimes bytaking advantage of the circumstances of war sides with the enemy.His faithless character and his challenge therefore deserve theseverest penalties. This applies especially to the cowardly black-outcriminal. I do not want, so the Fuehrer said, a German woman whomay go home from work at night time, to have to watch anxiously thatno good-for-nothing or criminal will hurt her, for the soldier has theright to demand that his family, his wife, and his kin at home areprotected.It can be said that the majority of the German judges have fullyrecognized the demands of the hour. The death sentence which waspronounced by the Special Court on the only 18-year-old criminal whoraped a soldiers defenseless wife, also meted out to the shirkerwho snatched handbags, justly puts the rights of the people inthe foreground. There are, however, still cases in which personalconsideration of the perpetrator is placed above the interests of theabsolute protection of the community. This is shown by the comparisonof the present judgments. The cunning handbag robbery at night by thepreviously convicted perpetrator and the twenty-one thefts of parcelsby the 19-year-old worker are not justly punished with 2 and 4 years inthe penitentiary. The decisive element here is not whether the takingof the handbag is legally to be considered theft or robbery--which,incidentally does not depend on whether it was carried loosely orpressed tightly to the body--or whether the sexual criminal hasdone any particular harm. The fact that in wartime he assaults in acowardly and cunning manner a defenseless woman and that he endangersthe security in the blacked-out streets puts him on a level with thetraitor. The safeguarding of our community demands that in wartime insuch cases punishment should serve, above all, as a deterrent. Hereprevention is always better than cure. Every punishment of a publicenemy which is too mild will sooner or later be detrimental to thecommunity and carries with it the danger of disease-like spreadingand gradual disintegration of our defense. It is always better, thejudge exterminates such a bacillus in good time than having to facehelplessly a contaminated multitude later on. In the fourth year of warthe criminal must not gain the impression that the community relaxes incombating him; he must feel always anew that the German judge fightsthe internal enemy with the same determination as the soldier fightsthe external enemy on our fronts.        2.

APPLICATION FOR COFFEE RATIONS BY JEWS             Decision of a Local Court of 24 November 1941In autumn 1940 a special coffee ration was distributed to thepopulation of the town B. Among others a large number of Jewsapplied for this coffee ration which, however, they did not receiveas they were excluded from the distribution _per se_. The foodauthorities saw in this conduct an offense against the distributionregulations and imposed fines on the Jews. Thereupon several hundredJews appealed against them and asked for a court decision, so thatabout 500 identical cases were pending simultaneously with the localcourt in B. The judge informed the food authorities that in his opinionthe imposing of fines could not be upheld for legal reasons--one ofwhich was the statute of limitations--and recommended rescinding them.The food authorities did not share this legal opinion of the judgeand refused to rescind the fines but suggested to the court that itmention only the point of limitation in case the fine should be setaside. Thereupon the court rescinded the fine in one case; the othercases were to be dealt with according to prescribed procedure and withreference to this decision.This ruling, in seven sections and covering 20 pages, contains verboseinterpretations of the factual and legal position. The introductiontries to justify in long tirades the length of the reasoning. Thenit is set forth in detail that the Jews had been able to registerwith their grocers _before_ the official announcement of theimpending coffee distribution, since the distributors had been informedin advance by their respective economic groups. The contraryinterpretation on the part of the food authorities was absolutelyincompatible with the established facts, as the food authorities hadoverlooked various factors. After an entirely immaterial descriptionof the attitude of the individual grocers toward the Jews after theannouncement of the decree, the document deals in detail with theinvestigations undertaken by the food office. The ruling continues thatthe court had tried in vain to cause the public prosecutor to take overthe pending cases and deal with them in the regular manner, but thatit had also refused on the grounds that no punishable act had beencommitted by the Jews, or, at least, that it falls under the statuteof limitations. After again dealing with the fruitless efforts of thecourt to have the food office withdraw the fines, a series of factualand legal questions are declared irrelevant, but nevertheless discussedin detail beforehand. The following nine pages of the ruling deal withthe examination of the legal question whether the registration of theJews must be regarded a punishable act according to the distributionregulations. They arrive at the conclusion that this is not the caseand that it would be wrong to prove it by means of an abstruseinterpretation of the law. The long interpretation culminates in thesummarizing statement that the Jews had not committed a punishable act.               Opinion of the Reich Minister of JusticeThe ruling of the local court, in form and content amounts to pilloringa German administrative authority by the Jews. The judge should haveput himself the question: How will the Jews react to this 20-page-longruling, which certifies that he and the 500 other Jews are right andthat he won over a German authority without losing one word about thereaction of our own people to this insolent and arrogant conduct of theJews. Even if the judge was convinced that the food office had arrivedat a wrong judgment of the legal position, and if he could not make uphis mind to wait with his decision until the question, if necessary,was clarified by the higher authorities, he should have chosen a formfor his ruling which under any circumstances avoided harming theprestige of the food office and thus putting the Jew expressly inthe right. The freedom from punishment for the unauthorized coffeeregistration was, even according to the law then in force, definitelydoubtful. The fact that Jews were not entitled to a supply of genuinecoffee was self-evident even if it was not specially mentioned inthe official decree. Registration had taken place by presentationof a coupon of the ration card and by having this card stamped. If,considering the special circumstances of this case, this had beenconstrued as an abuse of the right to draw rations, it could haveresulted in an affirmation of the punishable character of their act.The impudent, provoking conduct of the Jews would have made it aparticularly serious case. In this case an offense could legally havebeen assumed. To such an offense a longer statute of limitations wouldhave applied.A legal view of this kind on the part of the food office need not havebeen regarded as untenable, fabricated, or abstruse.Apart from this it was not necessary to point out to the Jew that hewas only one of many members of his race who also had complained.Just as superfluous was the information that the food office in thepreceding negotiations had refused to withdraw the fines and thatthe local prosecutor, through its refusal to take up the case, hadalso shown its opposition to the food office. These points wereirrelevant to the ruling. The Jew could perforce only gain theimpression of a dissension between the various authorities. Instead ofthis a few sentences of the ruling, dealing merely with the statuteof limitations, would have been sufficient if the judge denied thepunishable character of the offense.The voluminous argument of the case would not even have been necessaryif the case had involved a German. The order of the Fuehrer in thedecree of 21 March 1942 on the simplification of the law that courtrulings must be given in short and concise form and must be limited tothe absolutely essential was already a wartime necessity. The Germanfellow citizen does not expect verbose and learned statements from thejudge. The various ancillary and incidental considerations which guidethe judge in his decision do not interest him. He wants to be informedby a few easily understandable words on what grounds he was found rightor wrong.         4. VIOLATION OF FOREIGN-EXCHANGE REGULATIONS BY A JEW              Verdict by a District Court of 26 May 1942The defendant, a 36-year-old Jew, had in 1936 taken possession of hisdeceased fathers textile firm. In 1938 he emigrated to Holland. In1941 he was arrested in Amsterdam.The defendant is guilty of a number of cases of illicit dealings. Hisactivities began when he, as the chief heir of his father, ostensiblyrenounced his inheritance in favor of his sister who was a foreignerwith the intention of depriving the German foreign currency controlof the entire domestic and foreign fortune; simultaneously he made anagreement with his sister that everything should remain as it was.From their holdings in a firm in Holland which, as a subterfuge, weretransferred to a dummy, the Jew and his fiancee received about 100,000Dutch guilders in 5 years, which were not offered to the Reich Bank.He also disposed of the proceeds from various houses without a permit.As for the Dutch firm, which was practically his own, he deceived theReich Bank for several years by pretending that he had nothing to dowith it, and that moreover it was in the red and unable to repay aloan. In doing so he cheated the German authorities by producing forgedbalance sheets. Finally, after the Aryanization of his firm, he triedto persuade the new owners, former employees of his, through reductionof his claim by 80,000 RM, to bring 40,000 RM across the border toHolland without a permit. When his property was registered as Jewishproperty the defendant concealed considerable assets. He defendedhimself mainly by asserting that all these offenses were only thecontinuation of his fathers violations of foreign currency regulationsand that he was under the influence of his sister.For the reason given by the defendant the district court did not findit a grave offense in the sense of article 42 of the Foreign ExchangeRegulation of 4 February 1935, nor of article 69 of the ForeignExchange Regulation of 12 December 1938. It sentenced the defendant toa total of 2 years imprisonment, making allowance for the pretrialdetention and to a fine of 9000 RM.The verdict, in the accompanying opinion, discusses first of allfacts that might be extenuating and mentions that the defendant hadnot previously been convicted; he had acted under a certain coercion,owing both to his fathers doings and to his sisters obstinacy. Oneoffense by necessity led to the next. Through his confession he hadconsiderably facilitated clearing up the facts. On the other hand, thelong duration of his offenses, his fraudulent conduct toward the Germanauthorities, and the requests he made of his former employees werecited as demanding a heavier punishment.               Opinion of the Reich Minister of JusticeThe court applies the same criteria for imposing punishment as it wouldif it were dealing with a German fellow citizen as defendant. Thiscannot be sanctioned. The Jew is the enemy of the German people, whohas plotted, stirred up, and prolonged this war. In doing so, he hasbrought unspeakable misery upon our people. Not only is he of differentbut of inferior race. Justice, which must not measure different mattersby the same standard, demands that just this racial aspect must beconsidered in the meting out of punishment. Here, where a profiteeringtransaction typical of the defendant as Jew and to the disadvantageof the German people had to be judged, the verdict in awarding thepunishment must take into consideration in the first place that thedefendant had deprived the German people for years of considerableassets. He had, as innumerable members of his race have done beforehim, ruthlessly and for deliberate selfish reasons violated the mostvital German interests by profiteering and fraud. He has abusedGermanys hospitality, which had enabled him and his father to pileup a huge fortune, and finally has not hesitated to instigate Germanmen who depended on him economically to serious violations of foreigncurrency regulations, violations which endangered their very existence.From these general points of view of the German people the question hadto be clarified whether this was a particularly serious case; it didnot suffice here to rely solely on the rather unconvincing statementsof the defendant himself, who could not have been under coercion for 4years, but acted in his own interests and on his own initiative. Thistypical Jewish parasitical attitude required the most severe judgmentand heaviest punishment. The reflections of the Jew and his family, inthis respect, are of very minor importance.           5. CONCEALMENT OF THE REQUIRED DESIGNATION AS JEW               Verdict of a Local Court of 24 April 1942A Jewish proprietress of a boarding house had failed to apply for theaddition of the surname Sara in the official telephone directory 1940and 1941. The local court sentenced her to a fine of 30 RM, or analternative of 10 days imprisonment. In the opinion it says: Accordingto the ruling of the local court, Jewesses are obliged to add the nameSara to their names in the telephone directory. Therefore, the Jewessis to be fined. The reason for the mild sentence was the fact thatsometimes individual judges had not ruled in conformity with the localcourt.               Opinion of the Reich Minister of JusticeThe verdict contains no grounds for the sentence. The reference to aruling of the district court does not free the judge from offering anopinion of its own; on the contrary, it rather gives the impressionas if the judge had half-heartedly and reluctantly submitted to theauthority of the district court. The verdict should give the essenceof the grounds in a short and concise form. Here the essence is thefollowing: when she registers in the official telephone directory,the defendant enters into general legal and commercial life as theproprietress of a boarding house. The registration in the telephonedirectory is in the nature of the subscribers visiting card fortelephonic business relations. Application for change of name istherefore absolutely necessary in order to avoid mystification.Moreover the grounds for awarding the punishment are not sufficientlyset forth. The verdict must make a clear decision--if the court findsan action punishable, then it has to award the punishment appropriatefor this action regardless of whether other courts have, becauseof incorrect deductions, acquitted the culprit. The idea that thedefendant did not have to expect a sentence with certainty because thecourt rulings, owing to deviating verdicts, were not yet uniform doesnot justify leniency. The court which is lenient because of one singlewrong judgment actually compromises with the defendant. But what shedid was a typically Jewish camouflage in her business dealings. It issurprising that people are only gradually realizing this.

FORGERY OF A TESTIMONIAL BY A CLERK              Judgment of a local court of November 1942A 19-year-old, so far unpunished clerk, who had worked in a firm ofmachine tool makers wanted to be employed in a larger enterprise. Forthis purpose she made herself out a testimonial of her present firm inwhich she confirmed that she was efficient and able to cope with anindependent leading position. She forged the signature of her chiefby tracing it from the signature folder and copying it with ink. Thisbrazen forgery was immediately discovered when the testimonial paperswere submitted to the new firm, to which she had been referred by thelabor office.The prosecution sees in the action of the part of B. severe forgery ofdocuments (pars. 267 and 268 of the Reich Criminal Code) on account ofthe fact that the forgery was committed for monetary gain. The proposedpenalty was 2 months imprisonment and a fine of 30 reichsmarks.The local court saw in this offense the given facts as containedin the former paragraph 363 of the Reich Criminal Code whichprovided imprisonment or a fine up to 150 reichsmarks for forgery oftestimonials for the purpose of improvement of ones position. Asthis ruling, however--this is what it says in the judgment--has beenrescinded through the law of 4 September 1941 and has been substitutedby the new paragraph 281 of the Reich Criminal Code (misuse of identitypapers)--which however does not apply in this case as the testimonialis not a document of identification--the court has only to regard theaction of B. either as a grave forgery of a document according toparagraphs 267 and 268 of the Reich Criminal Code or again to applythe provision of paragraph 363 of the Reich Criminal Code despiteits having been cancelled and to consider it still in existence inaccordance with the sound sentiments of the people and in accordancewith the will of the legislator insofar as the provisions of paragraph281 of the Reich Criminal Code are not complied with. The courtassumed the alleged second possibility. Working on the principlethat nowadays the judge is no longer obliged to adhere slavishly tothe exact letter of law, the court found the accused guilty of havingforged a testimonial according to paragraph 363 of the Reich CriminalCode.The sentence was 3 weeks arrest.On passing sentence the judge remarked that the convicted person may beplaced on probation, which was later granted.               Opinion of the Reich Minister of JusticeIt is correct that nowadays the judge should no longer have to adherestrictly to the letter of law in a slavish way. This freedom inapplying the law should, however, not lead the judge to base judgmenton a law, which the legislator has cancelled. Moreover, the manner inwhich paragraph 363 of the Reich Criminal Code is applied assumes alaw which is still in existence. Paragraph 363 of the Reich CriminalCode was cancelled because particularly during the war it was no longerpossible to counter all forgeries of certificates generally with thepurpose of furthering ones advancement merely by light contraventionpunishment. The many opportunities of changing ones job frequentlythese days offer the temptation to facilitate this change of positionthrough such forgeries of testimonials. Such temptation must thereforebe countered by a threat of more severe penalty than was provided bythe former paragraph 363.This generally more severe measure applied to such cases does not,however, prevent from justly taking into consideration the particularcircumstances of individual cases within the framework of now existinglaw codes, if the offense as in this instance is really a mild one. Thejudge sensed correctly that B.s offense corresponded to the degree ofguilt of the former paragraph 363. He could have provided for this alsounder existing laws.=B.= is a yet young and inexperienced girl of whom one mayassume that she was not entirely conscious of the extent of her deed.This impression is confirmed by the primitive means of the forgery.=B.= endeavored to leave her present firm in order again to workin a larger enterprise. For this reason she wished to make her recentactivity appear to the best advantage. It cannot simply be assumed thatshe thought of a better paid position in doing so, especially as itis not so simple to secure such a position under wage scales in forceat present. In consequence, it could be rejected that she sought amonetary gain. Thus only an ordinary document forgery could be dealtwith in accordance with paragraph 267 of the Reich Criminal Code.As the penal code did not demand imprisonment, having regard to thespecial circumstances of this case, the judge could have imposed a fineaccording to paragraph 27b of the Reich Criminal Code.The payment of this fine would have more forcibly brought home to thestill young =B.= the antisocial action of this deed rather than animprisonment, which the judge immediately postponed.        14. REFUSAL BY A SCHOOL CHILD TO GIVE THE GERMAN SALUTE         Decree by the Court of Guardians of 21 September 1940An 11-year-old girl is conspicuous in school through continuouslyrefusing the German salute. She bases this on her religious convictionsand cites in explanation some passages from the Bible. In mattersconcerning the Fuehrer she appears altogether disinterested.The parents, who also have a 6-year-old daughter, approve of thisbehavior of the child and obstinately decline to influence the childto the contrary. They also refuse to give the German salute and pointto the passage in the Bible, Do nothing with an upraised hand for itdispleases the Lord. They adhere to this in spite of advice by thecourt and the director of the school. The mother refuses altogether todiscuss it with the child. The father is willing to do so, but saysthat the child should decide herself. The parents prove themselves tobe adversaries of the National Socialist State also in other respects.They possess no swastika flag. They did not enter their child for theHitler Youth: they were expelled from the National Socialist PublicWelfare Association, because they will not support the collections,despite an adequate income of the man. Nevertheless they deny beingadversaries of the movement. The juvenile board suggested that theparents should be deprived of the right to bring up the two children onaccount of their attitude.The guardianship court refused to carry out this proposal and merelymade an order for supervision by a probation officer.In the explanation, the court stated that it had not been proved thatthe parents were adversaries of the National Socialist movement or thatthey really had fought against it; they were merely not sympathetic tothe movement and not willing to promote it.It was stated furthermore that the parents are only in so farresponsible for their attitude toward the National Socialist movementas they act contrary to the relevant penal laws. The parents mustrealize that the children must be brought up in the National Socialistspirit and that the schools have instructions to educate them in thatspirit. If the parents are not willing to bring up their children inthat spirit themselves, or if they believe that their religious viewsdo not allow them to bring up their children in that spirit, the leastthat must be demanded from them is not to oppose National Socialisteducation at school. Owing to the fact that the child is well broughtup in other respects and that--judging from the courts personalimpression--the parents are of absolutely reliable character, it maybe assumed that in future they will not give the school any troublewith respect to education.The court of appeal rescinded the decision of the guardianship courtand deprived the parents of the right to look after their children, asthey are not fit to bring them up.               Opinion of the Reich Minister of JusticeThe judge at the guardianship court in his decision misunderstood theprinciples of National Socialist education of youth.Today, the education of German youth is based on the home, the school,and the Hitler Youth (law regarding the Hitler youth of 1 December1936). They have to cooperate and each of them has to carry out thatpart of the educational task allotted to him by the community. The aimof this joint work consists in educating the young people in body, inmind, and morally in the National Socialist spirit for service to thenation and for the community.This aim can be reached only by joint cooperation of the home, theschool, and the Hitler Youth. Any opposition to and any deviation fromthis education endanger the common aim. An essential part of thiseducation as well as a particular responsibility have been laid intothe hands of the parents. They are united with the child by ties ofblood. The child lives close to them and constantly looks to the habitsand the example of the parents. To educate means to guide. To guidemeans to set an example by your way of life. The child models his wayof life on the example of his parents. What the child hears and seesthere, especially in early youth, it becomes accustomed to by degreesand accepts it as a rule of life. Therefore, the educational aim ofthe National Socialist State can only be achieved if the parents,conscientiously and aware of their responsibility, give their child inthought and deed a model example for its behavior in the community lifeof our nation. To this education of German man or woman belongs alsothe imparting of respect and awe for the symbols of the State and themovement at an early stage. Here, too, the community expects activecooperation on the part of the parents. A reserved neutral attitude isas harmful as attacking the National Socialist idea. Thus, indifferenceto the training of a patriotic member of the national communitymeans neglect of duty on the part of the parents and endangers theeducational aim for the child, even if this is not immediately apparentin each case. For this reason, it is not enough that in the presentcase the parents will not oppose the school in the future, they aresupposed to cooperate actively in their childrens education as awhole. Thus, the responsibility of the parents does not start where itsviolation becomes punishable. The child is often being endangered ifthe parents consciously oppose the educational work of the community.That was the case here. Who continues to refuse the German salute onaccount of erroneous religious beliefs, who separates himself from thegreat social work of construction of national socialism without anyreason, and who purposely withholds his children from the Hitler Youthand never takes advice, of him it can no longer be said that he merelydoes not sympathize with the movement and does not promote it. Heattacks it by his opposition and is its adversary. This is proved byhis convictions and by his inner attitude.Thus, the judge of the guardianship court ought to have deprived themof the right to look after their children simply by consideration ofthe fact that parents, who openly profess the ideas of the JehovahsWitnesses, are not fit to educate their children in the spirit ofnational socialism.

In the majority of cases the sentencesare considerably too mild, they do not sufficiently bear in mindthe thought of the protection of the people which must govern thepunishment of defeatism, and are in an incompatible disproportion tothe sentences which are in similar cases passed by the Peoples Courtand by other district courts of appeal. I would refer especially to thefollowing sentences which lately attracted my attention:1. Criminal case against Friedr. Linder--OJs. 205/43--, sentence ofthe 2d criminal senate of 7 January 1944 (President of the Senate Dr.Kiefer, District Court of Appeal Counsellor (Oberlandesgerichtsrat)Dr. Stuber, and Hegele, presiding officer of a chamber at the courtof appeal (Landgerichtsdirektor)). You made a report under date of28 April 1944 on this case on the sentence. In view of the dangerand of the frequency of the statements made, I must maintain theinterpretation already expressed in my decree of 15 March 1944--IVsecret I 5045 b/44--that the defendant, a foreigner, deserved a severesentence of penal servitude. I have therefore directed the files to theChief Reich Prosecutor at the Peoples Court to examine the questionwhether the extraordinary objection should be applied against thesentence.2. Criminal case against Karl Unger--OJs. 203/43. Sentence of the 1stpenal senate of 22 February 1944 (President of the Senate Cuhorst,Oberlandesgerichtsrat Dr. Stuber, and Oberlandesgerichtsrat Eckert).The defendant is an old active Communist who apparently remained anactivist also after the assumption of power and who has not givenup his former opinions. His age and the illness, to which you referin your statement of 17 May 1944, did not prevent him again to makemalicious Communistic oral propaganda at an especially dangeroustime. I must, in these circumstances, consider the sentence passed of2 years penal servitude, as being much too mild. I have thereforedirected this case also to the Reich Chief Prosecutor at the PeoplesCourt.3. Criminal case against August Jooss for aiding and abetting theenemy--OJs. 41/44--judgment of the 1st penal senate of 14 April 1944(President of the Senate Cuhorst, Landgerichtsdirektor Dr. Bohn).The foul defeatist statements made to the French civilian worker weredangerous to such a degree that even the mentally deficient defendantmust have known about the consequences, and they show a frighteningmeasure of lack of national dignity. The sentence passed of 2 yearspenal servitude must in these circumstances be described as inadequate.4. Criminal case against Johann Kornmayer--OJs. 31/44. Sentence of the1st penal senate of 24 April 1944 (President of the Senate Cuhorst,Landgerichtsdirektor Dr. Bohn, and Oberlandesgerichtsrat Dr. Stuber).The reasons aggravating the punishment which were appropriately statedin the sentence should have resulted in sentencing the defendant, anold Marxist, to a considerably higher sentence than 3 years penalservitude.5. Criminal case against Paul Friebel--OJs. 32/44--sentence of the1st penal senate of 4 April 1944 (President of the Senate Cuhorst,Landgerichtsdirektor Hegele, and Oberlandesgerichtsrat Eckert).The defendant spoke in an especially critical period, in favor of acapitulation after the Italian example. I cannot accept the sentence of1 years prison term as a sufficient punishment.6. Criminal case against Clothilde Radspieler--OJs. 26/44--sentenceof the 2d senate of 9 March 1944 (President of the Senate Cuhorst,Landgerichtsdirektor Payer).The sentence passed of 1 years prison term is not in proportion withthe particularly dangerous remarks made, even taking into account themitigating reasons of the personality of the defendant.7. Criminal case against Heinrich Brechtel--OJs. 221/43--sentencepassed by the 1st penal senate on 24 February 1944 (Presidentof the Senate Cuhorst, Oberlandesgerichtsrat Dr. Stuber, andOberlandesgerichtsrat Eckert).There are considerable doubts about the negation of the inner facts ofthe case, the defeatism, in view of the political past of the defendantand the undisputable meaning of his remarks. In any case the sentenceof 1 years prison term cannot be regarded as sufficient in the case ofthis old Marxist who saw a new light dawn after the fall of the Duceand who openly expressed his hostility towards the State.8. Criminal case against August Meier--OJs. 14/44--sentence of the1st penal senate of 26 April 1944 (President of the Senate Cuhorst,Landgerichtsdirektor Dr. Bohn, and Oberlandesgerichtsrat Dr. Stuber).In this case also the especially dangerous remarks of the defendantmade to the wife of a soldier and to a soldier have been punished witha sentence of 1 years prison which sentence is in no way satisfactory.I intend, also in the cases 3 to 8, to submit the files to the ReichChief Prosecutor at the Peoples Court for examination of the questionwhether the extraordinary veto should be applied against the sentencespassed.9. Criminal case against Maximilian Seebacher--OJs. 196/43--judgment ofthe 2d penal senate of 10 February 1944 (President of the Senate Dr.Kiefer, Oberlandesgerichtsrat Dr. Sick, and Oberlandesgerichtsrat Dr.Stuber).In the case of this defendant who, as a former Marxist, openlyexpressed his hope for an overthrow by violence, a severe penalservitude sentence would have been appropriate in place of the 2 yearsprison. In this case, however, for the reasons mentioned in yourstatement of 27 and 28 April 1944, I shall put aside my objections andrefrain from further action.10. Criminal case against Leo Graf--OJs. 22/44--judgment of the1st senate of 22 February 1944 (President of the Senate Cuhorst,Oberlandesgerichtsrat Dr. Stuber, and Oberlandesgerichtsrat Eckert).This defendant who had repeatedly propagated the abdication of theFuehrer, would have deserved a considerably severer sentence thanthe 10 months of prison term passed. For the reasons stated by you,Attorney General, in your report of 8 May 1944, the sentence passedmay, however, be accepted as just adequate.11. Criminal case against Alois Baum--OJs. 22/43 of the 1st penalsenate of 25 February 1944 (President of the Senate Cuhorst,Oberlandesgerichtsrat Dr. Stuber, Oberlandesgerichtsrat Eckert).This defendant, particularly as an old Party member, should have shownmore self-discipline. The annoyance about his treatment at the postoffice was certainly not sufficient reason to make such foul defeatistremarks. In view of the danger of these remarks, the sentence of 2years prison term demanded by the representative of the prosecutionwould at least have been appropriate. In view of the serious physicalailment of the defendant I shall, however, refrain from any furtheraction.12. Criminal case against Karl Peter--OJs. 28/44--sentence of thesecond penal senate of 18 April 1944 (President of the Senate Dr.Kiefer, Oberlandesgerichtsdirektor Dr. Sick, and OberlandesgerichtsratDr. Stuber).The sentence of 2 years penal servitude passed on this defendantappears to me precariously mild. Even if he be a mentally somewhatdeficient boaster he has, in an attitude of hostility toward theState, continually incited others in an especially hateful manner. Ishall, however, refrain from submitting the files to the Reich ChiefProsecutor.At the meeting at Kochem I requested the President of the Senate toexplain, in what manner in the fifth war year cases of defeatismshould be tried. I believe that I may now expect that the DistrictCourt of Appeal (Oberlandesgericht) Stuttgart will also passjudgments accordingly. It is indispensable that you, President of theOberlandesgericht and you, Attorney General, will in future directyour special attention to these criminal cases. I further request you,Attorney General, to report to me until further notice when submittingindictments for defeatism, what sentence you intend to demand in themain trial so that I may point out possible objections with regard tothe measure of punishment.

Recent sentences submitted to me which appear to be toomild, cause me to draw your attention to the particularly lenientsentences passed in the following cases:1. O. Js. 184/44 (IV g-23-3118/45) against Bastian u.T.[289]       *       *       *       *       *       *       *The judge in charge as well as the deputy of the attorney generalmust proceed from the fact that public undermining the militaryefficiency is punishable by death, according to article 5, paragraph1 of the extraordinary war penal ordinance;[290] only in less seriouscases may the death penalty be waived. Therefore, the death penaltyhas to be demanded not only if an especially serious case is underconsideration, but an offense of average gravity is sufficient torender the provisions of article 5 of the ordinance applicable. Onlythose cases can be considered less serious, where the gravity of theoffense is below average. The jurisdiction of the Reich Supreme Courthas developed the principle that a less serious case can be consideredas such only if the facts of the case distinguish it fairly clearlyfrom the usual type of the punishable act in question, in favor ofthe accused and if the over-all assessment of the circumstances,especially the offenders personality and the circumstances which mighthave induced him to commit the offense, justify a deviation from theregular jurisdiction [handwritten: usual punishment]. This principlealso applies to cases of undermining the defensive power with thereservation that on account of the particular danger in wartime farless importance can be attributed to extenuating circumstances arisingfrom the personality of the criminal than in connection with othercrimes.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *It is justified that the sentences should go by the effect of theremarks. In some sentences remarks can be found like, Serious harmhas not resulted from his action. I doubt whether in such cases therepercussions of the remarks have been followed up to the end. Theireffect on the audience can be determined through their interrogation;however, it is difficult to determine whether this audience has passedon the remarks, and what impression they made on third and fourthpersons. Reasons of this type are therefore only justified if extensiveinvestigations with definite results have been instituted.In the sentences cited above there are among the reasons for the awardof punishment, statements about the personality of the offender, theextenuating consequences of which are doubtful, for instance--   Especially hard life.   Uprooted by the Russian revolution.   Lets himself go frequently because of his rather surly nature.   He has been a good comrade.   People with a disorder of the stomach, as we know from   experience, are inclined to be disgruntled.   He may have been annoyed about a certain phrase in the radio   lecture in question.   He had to suffer under the Jewish boycott movement during his   activities abroad.(That should rather be a reason for more severe punishment).   The accused has been happily married to her husband, a veteran   of the movement. She maintains she also got along very well with   her husband as far as political matters were concerned.(That, too, in consideration of the grave utterances--OJs.275/44--should not serve as an extenuating but as an aggravatingreason, as on account of living together with a veteran of themovement, the woman should have been better educated than others inNational Socialist sentiment and thought.)Please discuss the sentences as well as my opinion about them in theproper way with the judges and public prosecutors in question, and seeto it that in all cases of undermining the military efficiency therequired severe punishment will be meted out in your area, too.

SCHILF (counsel for defendant Klemm): Now we have finishedwith the group of questions which concern the Party Chancellery. Now,we are coming to the last phase, that is, your work as Under Secretaryof the Reich Ministry of Justice.[292] The Tribunal knows when youbecame Under Secretary. Now, I am asking you, did you, yourself, haveany influence on your appointment to be Under Secretary in January 1944?DEFENDANT KLEMM: No, I did not. During the last 3 months of1943 I heard Thierack say to me that he was thinking it over whetherhe should propose me to be his Under Secretary; then, I heard nothingmore. I only told the head of my department at the Party Chancelleryabout that remark of Thieracks.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *Q. Mr. Klemm, we shall now discuss the subject of Judges Letters andalso the so-called Guidance Letters [Lenkungsbriefe]. You know that theprosecution submitted a very extensive amount of evidence in regard tothis subject.First I want to ask you about the Judges Letters. In what manner didyou participate in Judges Letters?For the information of the Tribunal, I would like to cite the documentsthat are concerned with this question. They are Exhibits 81 through86, 90, and 94 to 96 inclusive. The NG numbers are given on the listwhich I have submitted. Since the documents do not have to be discussedindividually, I believe it is sufficient to refer to exhibit number.Please answer my question, Mr. Klemm.A. The Judges Letters had already been issued for more than a year atthe time when I became Under Secretary. I cannot say anything aboutthe history of their origin. My participation was limited to having acarbon copy of the finished Judges Letters submitted to me in draftform. Thierack was given a copy at the same time. When looking itover, I had to start from the point of view of not only the selectionof the cases which had to be treated and the subjects, but also ofthe fundamental opinion of Thierack which had already been laid downby him in advance. Technical changes would have been of little avail,since Thierack looked at these drafts word for word and changed themconsiderably. He regarded the Judges Letters as his own exclusiveprovince.Moreover, of the letters which the prosecution has submitted here,I myself participated only in the Judges Letters, Document NG-321,Prosecution Exhibit 86.[293] All of the other letters date from thetime prior to which I was Under Secretary.Q. The prosecution regards the Judges Letters, from the point ofview of their contents as well as their form, as an illegal pressureexercised on judges and jurisdiction at that time. It asserts that itwas a serious intervention into the independence of judges. When youwere concerned with the Judges Letters, did you consider that effect?Did you fear it, or did you support it, or did you see those mattersfrom a different point of view than the prosecution asserts here?A. I wish to say the following about that. The thought never occurredto me that the impression could be created at all which the prosecutiontoday raises as a charge. The sentences were incorporated into theJudges Letters anonymously, that is to say, without stating the nameof the court, without stating the name of the condemned person or eventhe name of the judge, or the time. Through that, it was intended tobe emphasized, especially by this means, that the question of generalinterest and not the individual case was at stake, nor the praiseor the blame of a judge. By the manner in which these matters wereincorporated into the Judges Letters, in particular, the judge couldnot feel himself being addressed directly, as usually occurs in legaljournals, in which these sentences are published in the legal presswith the full naming of the court, the file number and the date, andthen there usually follows the discussions of the opinion.That the Judges Letters were confidential was not due to the factthat they had to be afraid of showing themselves in public, or thatsomething that was incorrect was supposed to be covered up. The reasonwas rather the following; the truthful presentation of the case, andthey were not hypothetical cases reported in the Judges Letters, butthose which had actually occurred. Thus, I am saying that the truthfulpresentation of a case could not always keep the judicial decisionsanonymous, but it was intended to avoid--also to the advantage of theperson who was condemned--that he not all over again be exposed topublic criticism. Furthermore, it was also intended to prevent thatthe public may learn of the wide and general criticism of one court byanother.The National Socialist press, in its total character, was exclusivelyhostile to the administration of justice, and the administration ofjustice in particular had to suffer the most unbelievable attacks inthe Nazi press. The press would have jumped at these Judges Lettersin order to criticize the administration of justice, and would havesaid, The offices of the administration of justice themselves statehow wrong the attitude of the administration of justice is. Above all,however, it was intended to be avoided that the Judges Letters wouldbe interpreted in an entirely wrong direction--that is, through thegeneral public--in clemency pleas, that in a false lay comparison, byreferring to Judges Letters, a claim for a pardon would be raised.In addition to that, the Judges Letters were intended to be thebasis for a friendly discussion between the highest authoritiesof the administration of justice and the individual judge. Judgesand prosecutors were requested expressly--by the Judges Lettersthemselves--to address requests in regard to the Judges Lettersdirectly to the Minister of Justice, and they were told that they werenot forced to go through channels. Every judge and prosecutor wassupposed to be a direct collaborator in these Judges Letters, and inthis direct way letters reached the Ministry of Justice.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *Q. We can now interrupt the subject of the Judges Letters. May Iinform the Tribunal I intend to submit more evidence in my documentbook in regard to this subject. Now we come to two so-called guidanceletters which bear your name, Document NG-676, Prosecution Exhibit178 and Document NG-627, Prosecution Exhibit 474.[294] These lettersconcern information issued by the Reich Minister of Justice which yousigned as Thieracks deputy. Witness, the first went to the presidentof the district court of appeals in Stuttgart. That is Exhibit 178.The second one is to the president of the district court of appealsin Hamburg. That is Exhibit 474. The contents of these documents showthat undermining of military efficiency was the subject. The sentencesby these courts of Stuttgart and Hamburg were criticized as being toolenient by the minister--that is by you--because they were signed byyou as deputy. Please describe to the Tribunal how these two letterscame about.A. Undermining of military efficiency was regarded as particularlydangerous. The reason for it was the experiences which Germany had in1918 when the German armies were far in enemy territory and through thefailure at home sufferable peace was prevented. Therefore, underminingof military efficiency was already in 1939 introduced by law as asubject for penalty. Care was to be taken that the will for tenacityand the inner strength and hope and faith in a sufferable end of thewar would be maintained. In view of the successes which the GermanWehrmacht had the first years of this war and also during the middleof the war, we hardly heard anything about reverses at that time withthe exception of Stalingrad. Thus, this crime never occurred. Onlytoward the end of the war when the military situation got worse, theprosecution had to send the indictment and the opinion to the Ministryof Justice. These matters were handled in the Referat, the departmentof Franke, in order to get a uniform picture of the jurisdiction. Itwas also important to pay attention to the fact that the penalties wereuniform in the different districts of the Reich.If it happened that in individual cases there were considerablemisgivings against the legal evaluation or the extent of the penalty,the files were submitted to the Oberreichsanwalt, the Chief ReichProsecutor, for review as to whether a further means of legal recoursewas necessary. The misgivings, however, referred not only to sentencesthat were too lenient, but also to sentences that were too severe.Only in the latter case it was simpler. One could help by means of aclemency plea. I here have to insert that neither the minister norI, myself, saw the opinions in cases in regard to the undermining ofmilitary efficiency with the exception of those cases in which theexecution of a death sentence which had been issued was pronouncedor cases in which the Referent or department chief requested theintroduction of a legal recourse. A longer observation of the sentencesin the Referat, or department, could then show that a certain districtdeviated from the generally recognized principles in its sentences,especially from the principles recognized by the Reich Supreme Court.PRESIDING JUDGE BRAND: Mr. Klemm, I think you fully explainedthe reasons why you desired to have uniformity. Now this particularexhibit indicates that in this particular instance you complainedof sentences being too mild. You have explained the reasons whichunderlay your theory in the matter, and I think you have covered itsufficiently. We must avoid such continuous repetition, Mr. Schilf.DR. SCHILF: Mr. Klemm, therefore let us go concretely to thecontents of these two letters. How did it happen that these two lettersas such were written? I believe it will be necessary to bore theTribunal with that still because your name is under this letter.PRESIDING JUDGE BRAND: Counsel, you are not boring theTribunal, nor is the witness. But we have the substance before us atthis moment of these letters and you need not ask the witness what thesubstance of those letters were. We are here to try the case fairly andwe dont want counsel to worry about boring us, but we do want counselto worry about undue explanations and too long explanations. Ask yournext question.DR. SCHILF: Please state the practical cause how these lettershappened to be written. Due to the decision of the court, you do nothave to discuss the contents any more.DEFENDANT KLEMM: The method for writing such letters hadalready been established long before I entered the Ministry of Justice.If cases accumulated in one district, the president of the districtcourt of appeal who was concerned received a letter so that in futurecases a general just sentencing, as it happened in the entire Reich,would take place.PRESIDING JUDGE BRAND: Why did you write this particularletter? Just ask him why he wrote the particular letter shown inExhibit 178.DEFENDANT KLEMM: These cases had been collected in theReferat--in the Department--and then they were reported to the ministerand the minister determined whether such a guidance letter was supposedto be written. In these two cases of Stuttgart and Hamburg, Frankeand Vollmer, the department chief, reported to the minister about thejurisdiction exercised by these district courts of appeal and suggestedto compile the most extreme cases and to call them to the attention ofthe presidents of the district courts of appeal. The minister approvedof this suggestion and in addition to that determined that I had tosign these letters. That in these letters, the first person singularI was always used, is the accepted official style. To that extent Imay refer to Exhibits 48, 94, 95, 96, and 99 in which simply Referentenand associates also write in the first person singular, although theletter bears the letterhead of the Reich Minister of Justice, and theysign it personally.DR. SCHILF: Mr. Klemm, in regard to the two guidance lettersto Hamburg and Stuttgart, were the judges who pronounced thesesentences and who had aroused the disfavor of Thierack supposed to becalled to account personally, or were measures supposed to be takenagainst them?DEFENDANT KLEMM: That was not supposed to be done in anycase. It would have been neither in accordance with the intentions ofthe Ministry nor was it the meaning of such a guidance. The presidentof the district court of appeals in Hamburg, who was requested at theend of the guidance letter to speak to the judges in the appropriatemanner, that was what it says literally in the letter, could handle itdirectly. As the official superior, he did not use this letter at all;but within the framework of a community of work within the NS lawyersleague, that is, on a purely comradeship basis and not as a superior,he spoke about these matters. Even less could the president of thedistrict court of appeals in Stuttgart issue measures to the individualjudges personally, or reproach them, because this letter was expresslyaddressed to him. At the end it says that you, Mr. president of thedistrict court of appeal should call direct and special attention tothese problems. There is also a circular letter by the Ministry ofJustice which is known and which emphasizes again and again that theindependence of the judges should not be touched.Q. But in the Stuttgart case the names of the participating judges werelisted. What was the purpose of that?A. Of the twelve sentences which are mentioned in the Stuttgart letter,nine had been pronounced when different members were sitting in thecourt. For that very reason the names were listed to show that theissue was not the failure of one individual judge, but that the generaljurisdiction of the district court of appeals of Stuttgart in mattersof undermining military efficiency was not in accordance with thewishes of the Reich level and the needs of the time.Q. In that connection the name of the codefendant Cuhorst is mentioned.Did you know at the time the then President Cuhorst?A. No, his name did not mean anything to me.Q. Did you know that the then Senate President Cuhorst was alsopresident of the Special Court of Stuttgart; and, were the guidanceletters supposed to criticize the jurisdiction of the Special Court atStuttgart?A. I did not know the jurisdiction of the Special Court of Stuttgart atall. That the same person was presiding judge of the Special Court andpresident of the senate of the district court of appeal was not knownto me at the time.       *       *       *       *       *Q. One final question in that context. In the two so-called guidanceletters, especially in the one to Stuttgart, mention is made of thefact that an extraordinary objection was supposed to be raised. Do youknow anything about whether that was done?A. The sentences were not sent to the Oberreichsanwalt with a requestto raise the extraordinary objection, but with the instruction toexamine whether it would be worthwhile to raise an extraordinaryobjection. In neither of those cases, neither in the guidance letterto Hamburg or to Stuttgart, the problem was the changing of prisonsentences to death sentences, but the questions were merely prisonterms and whether they should be increased but still remain prisonsentences. Thus, the Oberreichsanwalt was not instructed to raisean extraordinary objection. As far as I know, at the time, theOberreichsanwalt in the cases which were sent to him for examinationrefused to register an extraordinary objection; and, as far as I know,the minister was satisfied with those results of the examination.Q. With that we have concluded the question of the Guidance Letters.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *                c. Lawyers Letter Written by Thierack    PARTIAL TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT NG-260[295]    PROSECUTION EXHIBIT 87          EXTRACTS FROM LAWYERS LETTER NO. 1 SIGNED BY REICH             MINISTER OF JUSTICE THIERACK, 1 OCTOBER 1944                           Lawyers Letters             Information of the Reich Minister of Justice                             Confidential                   _Number 1, dated 1 October 1944_                         _LAWYERS OF GERMANY_The German people, on the threshold of the sixth year of war, facetremendous war tasks.The Fuehrer has ordered that all resources of the armed forces andarmament industry be used to the utmost in order to master theseproblems.In pursuance of these measures dictated by total war, theadministration of law will also be curtailed and simplified to a greatextent. The further mobilization of German lawyers into the armedforces and armament industry cannot be balanced only by curtailmentand simplification. Above all it necessitates the utmost concentrationof those elements which will have to carry on with our futureadministration of justice. Every lawyer who in the future will still beentrusted with his office must always be aware that the administrationof German justice has, now more than ever, the direct duty of securingthe frontiers and the waging of war, especially in view of the newtasks, which will arise through the increasing totalization of the war.Thus, the German lawyers have become the rear guard of the fightingforces. The complete concentration of all resources which this involvesand which is expected especially from the senior members who take theplace of their younger colleagues, presupposes unified direction andrigid execution of the work of all lawyers regardless whether they arejudges, public prosecutors or attorneys.In the hour, when our people have entered upon the decisive battlefor its right to live, each lawyer must concentrate all his attentionsolely on this battle for freedom. Everything that does not directlyserve this battle must now be put aside and everything that serves thisstruggle must be done with the least possible expenditure of time andwork and in the simplest fashion. When the life of our people is atstake, all other individual interests must be pushed aside. For sometime now there has no longer been any room for petty quarrels. Thingswhich yesterday had some importance are perhaps quite unimportanttoday. Legal affairs not immediately connected with the war, must alsobe dealt with in the shortest and most economical way. The only aim ofjudges, public prosecutors, and lawyers is to preserve the life of ourpeople.The lawyer who is very often the first to deal with troubles andneeds of his fellow countrymen is today entrusted with a particularlyresponsible task. Affairs which are not absolutely important in wagingwar, he must keep away from the law courts; however, legal cases ofimportance in respect to the war are to be dealt with quickly butnot less conscientiously as the need of the hour demands. This taskcannot be accomplished with good intentions only. Above all he mustbe thoroughly acquainted with the various plans and intentions of theadministration of justice in the various branches of law.I know that the lawyers are waiting for such a reorganization of theirwork and that such a regulation of the administration of justice willbe welcomed especially by the conscientious members. Therefore, I havedecided to introduce in these fateful hours, at a time of total war, anew chapter in our administration of justice by publishing the LawyersLetters which are to supplement the Judges Letters, published twoyears ago.These Lawyers Letters serve a double purpose. They are to informlawyers of the aims of the administration of justice by means ofpublication of the verdicts of law courts in various branches oflaw, which are of importance in conducting the war, and they are todemonstrate the policy of the court in order to save unnecessary workin regard to remonstrances, complaints, or legal remedies of all kinds,for which there is no longer any room today. On the other hand theyare to regulate the general relations of lawyers toward each other intheir own profession, and also toward the judges and public prosecutorsin order to develop close collaboration among all administrators ofjustice, and thus avoid future friction, complaints, or quarrels onthis subject as far as possible in order to mobilize all forces forthe actual legal work. The harder the times and the more stringent therestrictions, the closer cooperation should be among all administratorsof justice in their common task.Therefore, the Lawyers Letters, just as Judges Letters are to be aclose link between the administrators of justice and its personnel; andthus, judges, public prosecutors, and lawyers are to be more closelyconnected by a general reorganization of their work. These are notorders, but signposts to help master the great tasks which lie ahead ofus.I expect that no German lawyer fails to recognize the seriousnessof the hour and the magnitude of the task. I expect the completemobilization of all resources for tasks that war puts before us,including our peoples struggle for freedom. I know that we shall winthis battle, if we work together and fight like one man.With this in mind, I hope these Lawyers Letters are a means ofunifying and strengthening the fighting spirit of German lawyers.The letters are not to remain mere words but should take shape inactions!                                       [Signed] DR. THIERACKBerlin, 1 October 1944                   Conduct of Lawyers in Penal Cases1. The defense counsel selected by a citizen of the Protectorate whowas sentenced to 12 years penal servitude and 10 years loss of civilrights directed a letter to his client in the penitentiary, whereinhe held out the prospect of obtaining a mitigation of the sentence bymeans of a request for clemency. Among other things the letter states:   Today I have a personal request. Of your own accord, you   offered to recommend me to other well known Czech families, in   which some members met with a similar fate. You also informed   your wife of this offer at the last discussion we had together   with her. Therefore, I wrote to Prague, but received the answer   several times that likely clients needing defense counsel are   not known. Had I been acquainted with this fact, I would have   asked you during our many conferences to give me the addresses *   * *.   During the proceedings I was able to prove by many documents,   that you are not at all hostile toward Germany but definitely   pro-German. I also believe that you will find the right attitude   toward the new Greater Germany after this difficult experience   and wish you the best for the future.              With the kindest regards and Heil Hitler!                                                          yours,                                                          signature2. An attorney defended a woman, who together with her sister wasaccused of keeping contact with prisoners of war which was forbidden.Both women were accused of having received French prisoners of war intheir home, of having entertained them and exchanged caresses with them.Among other things the defense counsel said in his final statement:   We too, would be glad if kindness were shown to our German   prisoners of war in foreign countries, and we do not consider   those foreigners, who are kind to our German prisoners, liable   to punishment.3. Several Czech businessmen had to vindicate themselves beforea Special Court because of offenses against the penal order forprotecting the rationing of consumer goods (receiving butter they werenot entitled to). Their counsel said in his final plea,   I feel impressed by these defendants who like true German men   and good family fathers shouldered a responsibility which was   really one for their wives.In order to show the pro-German attitude of a defendant, the defensecounsel read parts of a speech which one of the defendants made on someoccasion with regard to the aims of national socialism. He interruptedthe reading and cried, I could almost believe I hear my Fuehrer speak.4. A factory owner had obtained a great deal of food for the canteenof his factory from the black market and had used part of it forhimself. Therefore, he was sentenced to 2 years of penal servitude forviolating regulations for war economy. In his plea the defense counselpointed to the fact that the food was of benefit to the workers, andthus also armament and the armed forces. He finished his speech withthe words--And now, then, condemn the defendant!In answer to the reproach of the presiding judge he declared that hecould formulate his plea in other words and demanded the acquittal ofthe defendant.5. Counsel took charge of the defense of a woman shopkeeper, who hadin several cases sold new bicycle tires and high tension batteriesto customers without purchase certificates in exchange for butter,meat, sausage, and bacon. She was sentenced to 2 years imprisonmentand a fine of 1,000 reichsmarks because of continued offenses againstthe penal order protecting the rationing of consumer goods and theprohibition of bartering.The defense counsel said in his final speech:   The defendant is not to be blamed for getting additional food   in an illegal way. She is very corpulent and therefore surely   needs more than other people. One need only look at that body   to see that it needs a considerable amount of food. The food   is insufficient even for normal persons. Reich Minister of   Health Dr. Conti himself declared, that the food rations are not   sufficient.The lawyer has repeatedly given cause for measures of controllinghim because of his professional conduct. To date, 16 statements ofobjection and disapproval have been made against him because ofinsulting expressions to the court, to colleagues and parties, andbecause of charging of inadmissible special fees, etc.6. A mother and her daughter were indicted by a Special Court becauseof offenses against paragraph 4 of the decree dealing with peopleviolating the national emergency orders. The daughter as the head clerkof a firm had stolen a large number of food ration coupons and clothingcards and had given them to her mother. The latter loosened the couponsfrom the paper and kept them for future use. The food bought with thosetickets was often served at their home parties.In his final speech the defense counsel expressed himself somewhat inthe following manner:   The indicted daughter was the brain of the firm. The rooms   expanded, the house expanded. According to that quotation it   is but natural that the daughter has given parties and invited   guests. The mother is a busy modest housewife, and both are   ladies of good family. The fact that the mother loosened the   coupons so neatly and guarded them so carefully shows her to be   a good and orderly housewife, who proved her orderliness even in   this work.The defense counsel came to the conclusion, that both women had earnedthe sympathy of the court and a reward for having confessed. Neitherdefendant, he finally said, did wrong; there is no criminal guilt.7. A basket maker who was defended by a counsel was sentenced to 3weeks imprisonment and 14 days detention for resistance against thepolice and for insulting and gross misconduct. In a drunken state hehad tried to cross a train track at a point where it was forbidden tocross and was offensive toward railway officials who tried to preventhim from doing so. In town he had molested pedestrians and resistedarrest by the police. The court had sentenced him to imprisonmentbecause the defendant had previously been punished at 4 different timesfor attacking superiors, and because prior to that he was sentenced toimprisonment for absence without leave while in the army.His defense counsel petitioned for clemency, asking that the prisonsentence be changed into a fine, and in so doing he pointed out thatthe defendant, who makes deliveries with his own team would be badlyaffected economically by the prison term; that he was released from thearmy because of imbecility and that, therefore, his offense was not sobad. He lodged a complaint against the refusal of the public prosecutorand in his argument he said, among other things, the following:   The case was taken much too tragically. Under prevailing   circumstances incidents which were punished with minor fines   in peacetime are now often looked upon as capital offenses.   This is due to the general nervousness by which the courts are   undoubtedly influenced. However, this is only temporary just as   the immense number of private charges. There is a lack of humor,   preventing us to see these things at their true value.8. A woman was charged with insulting another woman. She had calledout to the other woman who had shortly before lost one of her sons atthe front: They shot one of your boys, we hope they shoot the others,too.In his appeal the defense counsel said:   Without intending to minimize the heinousness of her words,   as they are stated in the indictment, the question of whether   the expression is an insult must be examined. The expression   contains--so it goes on to state--a malediction, a curse, and is   certainly wounding to the feelings of a relative, particularly   of a mother, very gravely, but thereby it does not amount to   defamation. It is not an expression slighting a person, and   therefore it is not an insult.The defense counsel adhered to this contention in his final speechalthough the president had pointed out to him that his standpoint aboutthe punishable nature of the expression was not tenable.When the insulted mother was questioned as a witness during theproceedings, she started to cry when the president asked her abouther son, and took out two pictures of her son in uniform and showedthem to the judge; whereupon the defense counsel declared that she wasobviously hysterical. After being sharply rebuked by the president, thedefense counsel answered in the same sharp way that he quite understoodthe grief of the woman, but he doubted the credibility of her words.The word over-excited was also used.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *               Opinion of the Reich Minister of JusticeThe problematic nature of the position of the attorney at law whichrests upon the premise that the lawyer acts, on the one hand, onprinciple as the representative of an individual citizen who appointsand remunerates him, on the other hand, as an agent of administrationof justice and lawyer of the community which has assigned him to andentrusts him with his function, has long been especially apparent incriminal jurisdiction. The evolution of civil right from the purelyprivate right of the past--when the individual pursued his rightmore or less for his own sake--to the civic right of our time inwhich the citizen also administers his private rights as trusteeof the community has indeed also changed and reformed the task andposition of the lawyer. This modification did not, however, become soobvious because in their widest sense the pursuit of justice and theadministration of justice in the domain of civil right still command,at least outwardly and notwithstanding the sway of the communitysinfluence, a form which does not make the dual position of the lawyerwith its inward conflict of duties so conspicuously prominent as hasalways been the case in the domain of criminal jurisdiction. A penalsuit according to our present idea of penal law is no longer a matterof two parties contending for their rights. Here, it is not a privatecitizen, threatened in his freedom, who disputes against a juridicalperson called the State opposed to him on a level of equality oragainst the State attorney before an independent judge for therectification of a claim raised against him by the State, but a citizenwho vindicates his conduct before the community and its leadershipto which he owes loyalty and consideration, against the suspicion ofbreach of loyalty or of contempt. Here it is not rights of freedomwhich are fought for but social obligations which are assessed. Here itis not mere compliance with the law that is examined; it is the honestcollaboration, the loyalty, and the worthiness or unworthiness of thepersonality of the individual citizen which are weighed and determinedfor the community. Here it is not so much a matter of the rights of thecommunity with regard to the individual as they have been given it bythe voice of the citizen, but rather that the individual has as manyrights and obligations as the community has conferred and imposed uponhim.It is evident that such a viewpoint must involve far-reaching effectson the position and task of the lawyer as the criminal defense counsel,even if outwardly criminal procedure does not essentially differ in itsform from the former criminal trial. As defense counsel, the lawyerhas shifted closer to the State and community. He is incorporatedinto the community of the administrators of justice and has lost hisformer position as unilateral representative of the interests of thedefendant. Whoever is not ready to accept this clearly and absolutelyand is not prepared and able consistently to act accordingly ought notto don the robe of a German lawyer nor take a place at the defensecounsels bench. Not only would he be at disagreement with himself,not only would he fall from one conflict into another, but he wouldalso though often unconsciously do harm rather than service to theadministration of justice and last but not least also compromise thereputation of those of his colleagues who think and act differently.It is obvious that as defense counsel the lawyer has found it so muchmore difficult than the judge and the public prosecutor to achieve thismental change. However, this must never convey the delusion that merelythe thorough and successful striving to acquire this professional frameof mind and a thorough devotion to this professional aspiration clearsthe way to the fulfillment of the difficult as well as responsible andgratifying office of defense counsel. What the issues involved in theindividual sphere by this altered role of the criminal defense counselare, will often be discussed in these Judges Letters in the future.The fact remains, at all events, that the qualification of the lawyeras criminal defense counsel, for which the bar has now been fightingfor over 10 years with varying success, will ultimately depend uponwhether and to what extent it succeeds in its attempt to attain thisnew role not only ostensibly but also in a really moral sense and tounite nonetheless, this enhanced position of obligations towards thecommunity with the obligations towards the individual citizens in sucha way that the community gets its right while the individual citizenwho entrusts himself to a lawyer is not abandoned or perhaps evenbetrayed.That this struggle of the bar is to this day by no means ended is dailyshown anew by incidents of professional routine, apart from the casesmentioned.I know full well that many lawyers shrink before this struggle fortheir new adjustment which calls at the same time for an honest pledge,because they deem it to be disloyal to their clients and therefore keepaloof from penal cases.My appeal is not meant for them. For whoever shuns moral obligations ordoes not have the strength to see the fight through could never indeedperform useful work as a criminal defense counsel.However, the motives which have formerly induced and are still inducingmany others to shun criminal cases are very diverse. There is noquestion here of those lawyers who from inclination or calling handlecivil cases only, and who in this and other spheres as lawyers ineconomic cases, for instance, mostly in an exclusively advising andmanaging capacity perform the most valuable legal work without thisever becoming known to the courts or the public. Of these I do not wishto make criminal counsel for it would be entirely amiss to take themaway from their important tasks and give them another one for whichthey feel no moral calling. Aside from this there is, however, quitea number of lawyers who decline to work on a criminal case becausethey generally consider criminal cases of secondary order becausethey are less juristic. One ought not to put questions of hierarchyof this sort between criminal law and civil law at all. The opinionthat criminal jurisdiction and thereby also counsel for criminalcases are of secondary importance--which is occasionally expressedeven today--can only be upheld by someone who interprets the conceptjuristic by abstract constructions and logic reasoning thus trying tomaintain a concept juristic which has long been given up in civil lawalso.Whoever realizes that law is of vast significance to the life of thecommunity, conscious of the problem facing a lawyer in the serving ofhis nation and its ways of life, recognizing the high ethical valueof such legal work, and measuring the importance of each individualcase for the community, will not underestimate the defense of thelife and freedom of a fellow citizen in a criminal case; but ratherconsider it more vital and important than the contesting of propertyrights or other legal questions which perhaps are of secondary concernto the community. And whoever has come to realize that a serious andresponsible defense cannot be conducted nowadays, with the knowledgeof a few sections of the penal code or even with rhetoric swing and anelegant appearance, but that in addition to this a profound knowledgeof modern criminal law and the entire legal sphere is essential not tooverlook criminal biology in its widest sense to which belongs aboveall an extensive understanding of politics, and intuition will agreethat, nowadays, the defense counsel in his own juridical value doesnot occupy a secondary rank any more than the judge or prosecutor. Onthe contrary the best lawyers are barely good enough to be defensecounsels or judges particularly when taking into consideration thevital importance of criminal law in wartime. Just as I fill the judgesseats only with the best today--the same principle applies to civilianlaw as far as the judges in the divorce courts are concerned whosimilarly decide the fate of human beings--so only the best lawyersshould be admitted as defense counsel.The measures required for the mobilization of all forces for total warwhich must lead to further curtailment in the administration of justicewill automatically cause some lawyers, hitherto engaged on civil casesonly, now and again to occupy themselves with criminal cases, insofaras personnel shortage necessitates this. For these lawyers, more thanfor their colleagues (who up till now have been for the greater part,or exclusively working on penal cases), it is necessary that theyapproach their new work from the very beginning with a clear innerattitude and professional conscience which will also give them thenecessary assurance in their appearance and work which is a primaryasset for successful legal work.They need not fear to be called upon to do legal work of a secondarynature. He who takes the job of a defense counsel in penal casesof importance to the war, also contributes to the war effort. Thismeans today, however, that he is expected to make a considerable wareffort. In cases where the State permits the use of defense counsel, itdoes not want to see court statisticians but sincere and responsiblefighters of the law who seek justice side by side with the judge andthe prosecutor. Penal cases have always demanded particularly exactingwork, due to the fact that the long sessions involve both physical andmental strain, and require in every case a higher personal effort thanthe most difficult civil cases, in which the main work can be completedin the office and at the desk.One of the main objections raised today by lawyers, and by no means bythe worst ones, concerning taking the job of defense counsel which canonly be approached with complete frankness can be found in results ofthe guidance of practicing law. The defense counsel, they say, onlyseldom has the opportunity to succeed, in getting through his deviatingopinion due to the close collaboration of judge and prosecutor, forinstance, in the introduction of evidence, or to find sufficientattention in his final plea so that sometimes it may appear that theverdict has already been pronounced prior to the main proceedings. Thelawyers success in any case is often rather minor, and the lawyervery easily attains a secondary position compared to the judge and theprosecutor.This contains both truth and untruth.He who is seeking success as defense counsel in penal cases mustfirst ascertain what is understood by it. It should go without sayingthat a conscientious lawyer does not only see success where hemanages to reduce the sentence proposed by the prosecutor, to findloopholes in the law for his client following the old tradition, orwhere he otherwise succeeds in exploiting the case to his clientsadvantage. He who only has this conception of the entire affair, notonly misunderstands the tasks of a defense counsel, and not only livesin penal conceptions of the past which have been overcome by theintroduction of paragraph 2 of the Reich Penal Code and by the lawitself, but he also lowers the value of his own work. The success of adefense must already be apparent in the consciousness of having doneeverything possible as a coresponsible lawyer in order to lead justiceto a successful conclusion.More than that the defendant could not demand and if he did--whichis humanly understandable since he cannot be arbiter on his ownbehalf--then the defense counsel should not support him.As far as the secondary position compared to that of the judge and theprosecutor is concerned which might be feared by quite a few, I canonly answer: Everyone achieves a rank in his life and profession whichhe works and fights for through his accomplishments and personality.The duty of a defense counsel is not limited to his activity in themain proceedings as many believe. His chief task begins much earlierwhile cooperating at the elucidation of the state of the case, theproduction of evidence to be introduced in court, and numerousinterviews prior to the trial.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *The defense counsel as a result of his dual position as a defensecounsel of one person on the one hand and as an administrator ofjustice for a community on the other hand will repeatedly face thedanger of the fact that the accused whom he is defending depends uponhim, making him forget that he is not the mouthpiece of his client butan independent administrator of justice. If, for instance, a defensecounsel submits applications only upon request of the defendant, orif he proposes the hearing of character witnesses though he himselfdoes not doubt the credibility of the hitherto heard witnesses, if headds more lengthy letters of the defendant to his brief as appendicesonly to comply with the defendants wish, this indicates either a lackof the required self-criticism or of the necessary energy toward hisclient in carrying out his office as defense counsel.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *The cases mentioned in this first Lawyers Letters, some of which haveled to reprimands and disciplinary measures are only a small part ofthe vast material at my disposal. They really speak for themselves. Atthe same time they show how much work remains to be done, if we areto solve the tasks which the increased totalizing of war puts to us.If we succeeded in releasing only part of the manpower--representedby lawyers at present engaged in examinations and court of honorproceedings--for really important and war essential legal work, aconsiderable contribution would have been made. To attain this is notonly the goal of the judicial administration. Lawyers themselves shouldcollaborate in this with self-discipline, which I particularly expectfrom now on.If there are any difficulties, doubts, wishes, and troubles, everylawyer may report these to me either himself or through his chamber sothat these questions may be discussed and cleared as far as possible inthese Lawyers Letters.As for the cases reported to me this is briefly to be said:(1) The letter of the defense counsel to a traitor in a penitentiaryspeaks for itself. Not only is the unconcealed wooing of clientsrepulsive, but especially the inconceivable lack of dignity and theservility with which this German lawyer addresses a declared markedenemy of the state, calling him Dear Sir, wishing him all the bestfor the future, and after mentioning his esteemed wife closes withbest regards and Heil Hitler, yours.Surely it cannot be expressed more clearly that one is unqualified forthe legal profession.(2) The lawyer, whose plea was that we would be glad if our Germanprisoners of war would be shown a kindness shows a total lack ofunderstanding of the seriousness and significance of this offense. Itis not the business of German women to show kindness to prisonersof war, but they should behave as German women. Decency and honorshould bar the least contact with prisoners of war who are still ourenemies. What should women who have resisted the temptation to whichthe defendant fell say if they hear a lawyer express such views?(3) As for the defense counsel, who was impressed by the attitude ofthe Czech industrialists who had bought butter without ration ticketsbecause the defendants like real German men they took the blame fortheir wives who were really responsible, all that can be said isthat he knows very little about the tasks of a German lawyer. Hereagain the lack of tact and understanding was not that he tried tominimize the offense. He obviously knows nothing about the situationof ethnic Germans in the Protectorate and about the interests of theGerman people. To mention a speech by one of the Czech defendants inone breath with a speech by the Fuehrer was--no matter how it wasmeant--outrageous. Such a thing cannot be excused as an awkwardmistake. Lack of instinct is a feature of ones character.(4) The lawyer who pleaded for a factory owner, accused of an offenseagainst wartime economy, was it is true right in pointing out thatthe defendant also thought of his workers when he acquired foodillegally. As far as this was a fact he even had to point it out. Butin disregarding the fact, that the defendant as the sentence of 2years penal servitude shows bought considerably for his own benefit,he has violated his duty as defense counsel. Furthermore, in trying toinfluence and mislead the court by saying and now condemn the accusedthus demanding the acquittal of the defendant, he went far beyond thelimits of a possible and legitimate defense. This suggestion had togive everybody and not least the defendant, too--to whom he should haveexplained his offense--the impression that the sentence was unfair andas such contrary to the interest of the people. This type of plea doesnot serve, but damage the administration of law.(5) The next two cases also show that some defense counsel have notyet, in the fifth year of war, recognized the importance of criminalproceedings to war economy. To excuse black market activities withthe obesity of the accused can scarcely have been meant seriously andcan, of course, not meet with success--except for the bad impressioncounsel makes. This again cannot excuse the temporary lapse, becausecounsel has, by saying incorrectly and tactlessly later on that theReich health leader himself describes the food rations as insufficient,revealed that he himself disagrees with our laws and government. The16 objections and reprimands brought up against him so far confirm thepicture, which he has given of himself in this case.(6) To defend parties and dinners given by the two better class womenwith the help of stolen ration cards by saying that business, so tospeak, required such parties is just as stupid as it is to expect thecourt to find the defendants not guilty of an offense. Such statementsnot only show considerable lack of understanding of the importance ofcriminal cases in the field of the law of war economy, but they shouldnever be made at all in a court of law.(7) Humor should certainly not be suppressed especially in difficulttimes, but only where it is appropriate. But it is inconceivable for adefense counsel to reproach a court or the prosecution for their lackof humor, because a defendant who indulges in a drunken brawl annoyspeople and resists the police received a well earned punishment. Thedefense counsel would have done better to consider that in the fifthyear of war one should not burden judges and prosecutors with uncalledfor petitions for mercy and complaints; about the latter there is stillmuch to be said. He would have done better to make it clear to hisclient who had already repeatedly made himself unfavorably conspicuous,how to conduct himself in these times instead of backing him up by hisfalse statements.(8) If in this case the defense counsel raises legal doubts againstthe assumption of an insult to the mother, he can thus only intend toobtain an acquittal. Therefore as a representative of the law he takesthe view that in such cases according to our law there is no protectionof the honor of soldiers killed in action and their relatives. Thisattitude and his subsequent conduct at the trial, in which he calledthe gravely afflicted mother of the dead soldier hysterical and highlystrung, when facing the judge she naturally re-experienced her painand sorrow, revealed, even had the mother been very excited, a rareabsence of any feeling for the community and human compassion. He whotries to cover such a criminal deed, particularly as a representativeof the law, puts himself ideologically on a level with the defendant.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *      d.

In the afternoon of 6 June, SS Obergruppenfuehrer Kaltenbrunner[297]informed the Deputy Chief of the Operations Staff of the Armed Forces,in Klessheim, that this question had been discussed a short timepreviously between the Reich Marshal, the Reich Minister for ForeignAffairs, and the Reich Leader SS. In the course of this conference,and in opposition to the original suggestion of the Reich Ministerfor Foreign Affairs, who wanted to include any kind of terror attackagainst our own civilian population--thus bomb attacks on citiestoo--an agreement was reached, according to which _only machine-gunattacks directly_ aimed at the civilian population and its property,should be considered as constituting criminal acts in this sense._Lynch_ justice should be considered as being _the rule_.Sentencing by court martial and transfer to the police, on thecontrary, had not been discussed.2. The Deputy Chief of Armed Forces Operations Staff set forth--_a._ In pursuance of the broad outlines sketched by Reich MinisterDr. Goebbels and various press reports which point in the samedirection the main task now consists in _making public_ a case ofthis kind which has been unexceptionally confirmed stating the nameand the unit of the concerned airman, the place where it happened, andother details in order to establish accordingly the seriousness ofthe German intentions in the face of incredulous enemy propaganda,and above all in order to achieve the desired deterrent from furtherassassinations of our own civilian population. Accordingly, thequestion is to be put whether such a case is in the files of the SD, orwhether the necessary facts are at hand in order to fabricate such acase with the necessary details.Obergruppenfuehrer Kaltenbrunner answered both questions _in thenegative_._b._ Deputy Chief Operations Staff of Armed Forces points out thatbesides lynch justice the procedure too of a segregation of any suchenemy airmen who are suspected of having committed criminal acts ofthis nature, their admission into the airmen reception camp Oberursel,and upon confirmation of suspicion their transfer to the SD for specialtreatment should be prepared.In this connection, the Operations Staff of the Armed Forces is incontact with the High Command of the Air Force, in order to establishthe directives with which, in such cases, the commander of Oberurselcamp would have to comply.SS Obergruppenfuehrer Kaltenbrunner declares that he agrees absolutelywith his suggestion and with the _taking over of the segregatedindividuals by the SD_._c._ Concerning the _publicity_ question, an agreement isreached that until further notice an agreement between High Command ofthe Armed Forces/Operations Staff of the Armed Forces, High Command ofthe Air Force, and the Reich Leader SS should be arrived at in any casein order to _establish_ the _form_ of publication.The cooperation of the Foreign Office is to be secured through theOperations Staff of the Armed Forces.3. In the course of a conference with Colonel von Brauchitsch (of theHigh Command of the Air Force) held on 6 June, it was established thatthe following acts are to be considered as terrorist acts justifyinglynching:_a._ Low level machine-gun attacks on civilian population, onsingle individuals as well as on gatherings;_b._ Attacks on own (German) airplane crews dropping by parachute;_c._ Machine-gun attacks on passenger trains of the regular publicservice;_d._ Machine-gun attacks on hospitals, field hospitals, andhospital trains clearly marked with the Red Cross sign.The facts listed under 3 are to be communicated to the commander of theairmen reception camp at Oberursel. If any such facts are proved byinterrogation, the prisoners are to be delivered to the SD.Colonel von Brauchitsch said that another report about these matters tothe Reich Marshal was not necessary.

At the same time theprocedure should be established as to the _publication_ of suchcases which have led either to a lynching by the population or--in caseof apprehension of terrorist airmen by armed forces or police--to aspecial treatment by the SD.In agreement with the Commander in Chief of the Air Force [Goering], Iintend to write the communication a draft of which is attached whichshould be an instruction to the commander of the airmen receptioncamp at Oberursel. It concerns such cases in which, according to aninvestigation made in this camp, it is found suitable to segregate theculprit, owing to confirmation of suspicion, and to transfer him to theSD.Previous to any publicity in the press, by radio, etc., it mustbe insured that name, unit, place of crime, and other detailedcircumstances present a perfectly clear picture which publication mayeffect the intended result of deterring from further murders. In thisconnection, the formulating of publication should make allowance forthe circumstance that enemy protests of all kinds are to be expected.Therefore, and in agreement with the chief of the Security Police andthe SD and with the director of censorship, it is intended that priorto any publication and until further notice an agreement is to bereached between the High Command of the Air Force, the Operations Staffof the Armed Forces, the Foreign Office, and the SD, in order to settlefacts, date and form of publication.You are requested to confirm, if possible not later than 18th instant,that you agree with the above principles as well as with the procedureintended for publications.1 enclosure        3.

No. 772991/44.....II.ed.Subject: Treatment of enemy terrorist airmen.The Foreign Office agrees to the intended measures as a whole,notwithstanding the clearly palpable objections from the viewpoint offoreign policy and international law.Examination in detail should differentiate between cases of lynchingand cases of special treatment by the SD.I. In cases of lynching, a sharply defined establishment of criminalfacts according to paragraphs 24 of the letter of June is not veryimportant. First, a German authority is not directly responsible; deathhas already taken place before some German authority deals with thematter. Further, the circumstances will be such, as a rule, that itwill not be difficult to represent the case in a suitable manner onpublication. Accordingly, in cases of lynching, the principal aim willbe to _deal suitably with the individual case on publication_.[Handwritten marginal note] only this was the aim of our letter.II. The procedure suggested for _special treatment_ by the SD[299]with subsequent publication, would only be defensible if Germanywould openly repudiate at the same time, and in this connection, theobligations under international law which are in force now and whichGermany still recognizes. When an enemy airman has been apprehended bythe armed forces or by the police and been transferred to the airmenreception camp Oberursel, his legal status has become _eo ipso_that of a prisoner of war. Concerning the criminal prosecution andsentencing of prisoners of war and the carrying-out of death sentencesagainst prisoners of war, definite rules have been established by thePrisoners-of-War Convention of 27 July 1929, such as, e.g., article 66,which provides that a death sentence may be carried out no sooner than3 months after notification of the death sentence to the protectingpower; in article 63: sentencing of a prisoner of war only by the samecourts and according to the same procedure as applicable to membersof the German Armed Forces. These regulations are so precisely wordedthat it would be hopeless to try to _veil any infraction thereof bya clever form of publication of individual cases_. On the otherhand, the Foreign Office cannot recommend a formal renunciation of theprisoner of war convention on this occasion.[Handwritten marginal note] this is already being prevented bythe intended segregation.[Handwritten marginal note] No--owing to segregation and thespecial treatment immediately following.A way of escape would be the following, viz, that suspect enemyairmen should not be allowed at all to have the legal status ofprisoner of war; that means that one should tell them immediatelyon capture, that they were not to be considered as prisoners of war_but as criminals_, that they be handed over, not to authoritiescompetent for prisoners of war such as a prisoner of war camp,but to the authorities competent for the prosecution of criminalacts, and that they then be sentenced in special summary judicialproceedings. If, during the interrogation under these proceedings,the circumstances prove that this special procedure is not applicableto the case on hand, then in individual cases the concerned airmencould _afterwards_ be given the legal status of prisoners of war,by transfer to the airmen reception camp at Oberursel. Of course,even this opening would not prevent Germany from being blamed forinfractions against valid agreements, and perhaps not even the takingof reprisal measures against German prisoners of war. Anyway, such anopening would enable us to keep to a clear viewpoint and free us of thenecessity of either openly repudiating valid agreements or of makinguse, on publication of every single case, of excuses which nobody willbelieve. Of the facts mentioned under 24 of the letter of 13 June, thefacts mentioned under 1 and 4 are legally unobjectionable. The factsunder 2 and 3 are legally not unobjectionable. However, the ForeignOffice is prepared to disregard that.[Handwritten marginal note] yes, this too is possible.It would perhaps be advisable to summarize the facts under 1, 3, and 4by saying that any attack of an airman on civilian population committedwith machine guns is to be treated as a criminal act. The individualacts listed under 1, 3, and 4 would then merely form particularlyremarkable instances. Nor does the Foreign Office see any reason whysuch attacks should not be punished, when committed upon civilianpopulation in ordinary dwellings, in motor cars, in river vessels, etc.The Foreign Office proceeds from the fact that German airmen are, as ageneral rule, forbidden, when attacking England, to make use of machineguns against the civilian population. As far as the Foreign Office isinformed, such a prohibition was issued some time ago by the Commanderin Chief of the Air Force. A general publication could point out thefact that such a prohibition is in force.III. The above considerations warrant the general conclusion that thecases of lynching ought to be stressed in the course of this action.If the action is carried out to such an extent that its purpose, viz,the deterring of enemy airmen, is actually achieved which the ForeignOffice approves of, then the machine gun attacks of enemy airmen uponthe civilian population ought to be given publicity in quite anothermanner than has been the practice up to now, if not in home propaganda,then at any rate in foreign propaganda. The competent local Germanauthorities, probably the police stations, should be instructed tosend at once, in every case of such an attack, a short and true reportmentioning details concerning place, time, number of killed andwounded, to a central office in Berlin. This central office ought thento transmit these reports at once to the Foreign Office for use.As such machine gun attacks on the civilian population also have takenplace in other countries, e.g., in France, Belgium, Croatia, Rumania,the competent German offices or the governments of those countriesought to be asked to collect in the same way news about attacks on thecivilian population and to make propagandistic use of these in foreigncountries in cooperation with the German authorities.IV. In the letter of 15 June the intention has been mentioned that anypublication should, until further notice, be proceeded by an agreement,i.e., with the Foreign Office. The Foreign Office attaches specialimportance to this and insists also that such an agreement take placenot only until further notice, but during the entire duration of theaction.

If this informationis true, the Fuehrer desires publication through radio and press thatany enemy airman who participates in such an attack and is shot downduring it cannot claim to be treated as a prisoner of war, but willbe killed as soon as he falls into German hands. This measure isto apply to all attacks on smaller places, which are not military,communications, nor armament objectives, etc., and which accordinglyhave no significance from the point of view of the war.For the time being, no measures are to be taken, but only to bediscussed between the armed forces and the Foreign Office.

Since when had you been attorney general at Duesseldorf?A. Since 1937.Q. Herr Hagemann, can you remember that in 1944, the Reich Minister ofJustice, Thierack, had issued a so-called circular directive[304] toall attorneys general which contained an instruction to the effect thatin cases where the German population had exercised lynch justice theprosecution had been instructed to report to the Ministry about suchcases?A. Yes, I remember such a decree.Q. Can you tell the Tribunal what the text was?A. No, I cannot tell you that. I can tell you the contents and what itsaid was that in such cases a report had to be made to the Minister.Q. Did that decree say anything to the effect that the Ministerintended to quash all such cases?A. I dont remember that passage, but it is possible that it didcontain such a passage. Generally speaking, all I remember is the factthat a report had to be made on such cases, and if such a case had beenpending with me I would have had a look at the decree, and I would haveread it through. However, as no such case ever occurred with me, Idont exactly remember the text because it never became topical for me.Q. Witness, would you kindly make a little longer pause after I finishmy question?A. Yes, I will.Q. Was that circular decree a so-called secret decree?A. Yes, it was.Q. And how did you keep it? Where did you keep it?A. Secret decrees were entered in the register by my senior clerk whowas in charge of the registry. After that, they were put in the safe.Q. Witness, in your district--that is to say, within the area ofthe court of appeals of Duesseldorf--in the fall of 1944, a case issupposed to have occurred where an SA leader shot down two or threeCanadian fliers who had been taken prisoners.A. Yes, I remember that case perfectly well.Q. Would you please give the Tribunal an account of that case?A. In September of 1944 parachutists made an attack near Arnhem. Inthe course of that attack some paratroopers drifted away, and camedown near the border between Holland and Germany. There, two Canadiansoldiers were taken prisoner, and an SA leader shot and killed them.That is the general outline of the case. I did not hear it from theChief Public Prosecutor at Cleve who had taken charge of the case, butI heard it from a judge at the court of appeals who informed me of thematter. Thereupon, I told the Chief Public Prosecutor in Duesseldorfto investigate the matter and immediately make a report to me. Hereturned; I ordered some additional investigations, and I myself madeinvestigations, too. I interrogated witnesses, for example. I believethe best thing would be for me to tell the Tribunal what the results ofall those investigations were.The two Canadian soldiers had been taken prisoner close to thefrontier. Two customs officials took them back. The Canadian soldierswere unarmed and, as I think is the custom with prisoners of war, theyheld up their hands as they walked along. The two customs officialstook them back like that, until they got to Kranenburg, a littleplace on the German-Dutch frontier. At Kranenburg that SA leader wasstanding in the street--his name was Kluettgen; next to him stood theKreisleiter of Cleve, whose name was Hartmann. When Kluettgen saw thosetwo prisoners coming along he told them to halt; he drew his pistolfrom his pocket and shot at the two Canadian soldiers. Kluettgen wasso cold-blooded that when at first his revolver was jammed he put itright, and then shot those two soldiers down. As I found out later, atthat time or soon after, he said, Now I have got two; I now only needanother two or three. I cant vouch for the latter figure, I dontknow exactly what he meant. However when he said, Now I need anothertwo or three, he meant this: In an air raid, I believe, Kluettgen hadlost five close relatives, and it became evident that that killing wasjust vengeance for his relatives whom he had lost in that air raid.That is to say, if I may put it that way, he acted in a modificationof the old saying An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. He justchanged it and made the eye for eye into number for number.That clarified the SA Leader Kluettgens position, but the partplayed by the Kreisleiter who had been standing next to Kluettgen,remained unclear. I believe I can remember that the Kreisleiter hadsaid something that wasnt quite above-board, something like, Thatsright, or just do away with them, or something like that. However,it was possible to interpret the words in various ways. It is justpossible that he had meant to say, Kluettgen should shoot them, orTake those two away, because somebody said afterwards that afterthose two people had been killed, the Kreisleiter had said that thatwas not what he had intended to happen.That was the outcome of the investigations.Now, as to the proceedings that were instituted.The Chief Public Prosecutor had ordered the police to arrest Kluettgen,but the police refused to carry out the order. Later on, when Iwas interned, I heard from a Gestapo official that there had beengeneral instructions issued to the police to the effect that menfrom the Ortsgruppenleiter upward were to be arrested and proceedingsinstituted against them only if the Party Chancellery approved, andsimilar instructions had been issued for people in the SA and the SS.Generally speaking, I did not encounter any difficulties when makinginvestigations. The SA gave its consent for me to interrogate severalpeople. The Kreisleiter, however, refused to make a statement untilwe obtained the approval, and it was the Party Chancellery which hadto give that approval; that is to say, it was Bormann. Although anapplication was made for such consent, it never arrived.I made a report to the Ministry about the case. Naturally, I had tomake a report because it was an important case, and reports had to bemade to the Ministry about all important cases.I told the Ministry, over the telephone, about the fact thatproceedings had been instituted, and I believe it was Dr. Mettgenbergto whom I spoke over the telephone. I told him as much as I knew atthat time. Afterwards I made a written report, that I intended to clearup the matter, and I eventually managed to clear it up. I also told theMinistry that I needed its support in order to obtain permission forthe Kreisleiter to make a statement.The Ministry was altogether in agreement with the way I had handled thecase. I received written instructions. I understood them to want me toclear up the case completely.There was no question of quashing the proceedings. Not one word wassaid of that.PRESIDING JUDGE BRAND: One moment please, Witness. Tellus, please, what did you mean by clearing up the case? Did you meanprosecute and convict? Or what did you mean?WITNESS HAGEMANN: What I meant first, was to establish thefacts and once they were established to suggest to the Ministry that anindictment should be filed against Kluettgen and, if necessary, alsoagainst the Kreisleiter. I could not make a final suggestion at thatstage because I did not yet know what part the Kreisleiter had played.That is to say, the Ministry agreed that I should carry out my plan toclear up the case, but because no approval was received from the PartyChancellery to interrogate the Kreisleiter, we could not close theproceedings.There were, of course, also great difficulties of transportation. Thefurther the war was brought into the country, the more difficult it wasto have any correspondence with Berlin.Q. What was the date of this case?A. I am afraid I cannot tell you the exact date. I think one should beable to find out from the history of the war. It was that parachuteattack near Arnhem. I think I am pretty certain it was in September.May I say that is the way I remember the case now. The files are inexistence.Q. It was in 1944?A. Yes, 1944. I did something which, as far as I know, I never didin any other case. I had two copies made of that file, one originalfile and a copy of it. I gave the original to my senior clerk, and Itold him to keep it, not to leave it in the courthouse at night butto take it home with him, and to take it with him to the air-raidshelter in case of an alert. I kept the duplicate myself, and wheneverthe alert came I took it with me to the air-raid shelter to make surethat if anything happened to either my senior clerk or to myself, onefile would always be available, so that there should be no difficultyin prosecuting the case. I was convinced that this was an importantcase not only from the point of view of guilt and expiation in theindividual concrete case, but also that was bound to be of importancefor the German armed forces, for, although I was not a soldier, Icould well imagine that if the Allied forces should come to hear thatthe German administration of justice had not prosecuted that case,they would take retaliation measures against German soldiers, or atleast might do so. In that event, soldiers who were innocent in thisconnection might have suffered for what Kluettgen, and possibly alsothe Kreisleiter Hartmann, had done.What may be of interest, is the reaction of the German population inKranenburg. There were some German civilians standing in the streetwhen this happened, who quite openly showed their indignation.Q. Was any indictment filed against the one who actually did theshooting?A. No, that was not done, because we had to wait. The role theKreisleiter played--Q. Please answer this question. Did you have any difficulty with thesecuring of the evidence concerning the actual shooting? As you havetold us you apparently had plenty of evidence as to that one person.A. Yes, against this one man I had the evidence, but as it was possiblethat another man was involved--the Kreisleiter--it was important thatwe should not just indict one man and deal with him alone, but toindict them together. We always did that in principle.Q. Well, let me ask you this. Was that a matter of German law, thatwhen you knew one man had committed a crime you didnt prosecute himbecause perhaps someone else might have helped him?A. But we did intend to indict him. We only wanted to await the resultof the investigations concerning the other person, so that we couldindict them both, because if we only indicted one, the proceedingsagainst the other one would have been confronted with a great manydifficulties. That was the way in which we proceeded, I should say,almost regularly.PRESIDING JUDGE BRAND: Very interesting.DR. SCHILF: Herr Hagemann, I would like to ask one morequestion. The President has asked you whether you were confronted withany difficulties in prosecuting one person. I am referring to Kluettgennow.WITNESS HAGEMANN: Yes.Q. May I ask you to tell us whether you had an opportunity to talk toKluettgen yourself, or to interrogate him?A. I asked the legal adviser of the SA, if possible, to make Kluettgencome to see me. At first, Kluettgen had worked near Kranenburg, butafterwards the SA had sent him to the district of Aix-la-Chapelle[Aachen]. He had some special transport mission there, and when he cameto Duesseldorf on one of those transportation errands, he came to seeme in my apartment one Saturday evening. I was ill; that is why I wasat home. I had a short talk with him, and I was not favorably impressedwith him. He told me that he had killed those two Canadians because hehad been afraid that foreign civilian workers who were loafing aroundin that district might have set those Canadians free. I wanted torefute that statement, and I did refute it by the testimony obtainedfrom witnesses. However, that motive would have been quite indifferentfor the legal evaluation of the case.As regards the clearing up of the case, it seemed important to me toconvict the man and prove to him that that motive could not have beentrue.Q. Witness, you have said that the order from the Chief PublicProsecutor at Duesseldorf to the police, to arrest Kluettgen, had notbeen complied with, and now you say Kluettgen came to see you. Didyou, as attorney general, not have the possibility to arrest Kluettgenimmediately?A. No, I did not have that possibility. It was a Saturday evening, Iwas alone in my apartment, and I had no weapons.Q. You said that Kluettgen had been transferred to the Aix-la-Chapelledistrict, and you said that the agency for which Kluettgen workedhad done that. In carrying out your investigations, did you findany indications that that was done intentionally in order to removeKluettgen from your jurisdiction?A. I did not find indications, and I certainly did not find any proof,but the possibility exists. However, it is also quite possible thatKluettgen was transferred from the Kranenburg district because thepopulation was excited.Q. Could you just tell the Tribunal approximately when the Alliedtroops arrived in Duesseldorf or Aix-la-Chapelle, the district whereKluettgen was staying at the time.A. Yes. I cant tell you exactly when the Allied troops arrived inAix-la-Chapelle, but they arrived in Oberkassel, on the left bank ofthe Rhine, at the beginning of March, and as far as I remember, theygot to Duesseldorf in April.Q. Up to that time proceedings were continued, were they?A. Yes.Q. And later on, after you had received the support from the Ministry,no instructions to the contrary were issued to you?A. No contrary instructions were issued to me. The matter wasconcluded. All that was missing was an interrogation of the Kreisleiter.Q. And, in accordance with your suggestion, they would then have beenindicted?A. Well, I couldnt make a suggestion because I didnt really knowwhat was the matter with Hartmann yet, but if I had found out, I wouldthen have suggested the indictment of Kluettgen and possibly of theKreisleiter too. However, as far as the Kreisleiter was concerned, thatdepended upon those investigations which had not yet been made.Q. I suppose these facts which you have described to the Tribunal canbe gathered from the files which you have mentioned?A. Yes.Q. May I ask you when you saw the files for the last time?A. In the spring of this year.Q. What has been done with the files?A. I gave them to the attorney general, Dr. Junker, in Duesseldorf inperson.Q. And presumably they are still there?A. Yes, I am quite sure they must be.PRESIDING JUDGE BRAND: I would like to ask a question. Thecase was pending for investigation from September 1944 until March1945? Is that what you meant to say?WITNESS HAGEMANN: Yes.PRESIDING JUDGE BRAND: Thank you.DR. SCHILF: Mr. Hagemann, did you ever hear--PRESIDING JUDGE BRAND: Just a moment. One question.JUDGE HARDING: What else did the Ministry do about it?WITNESS HAGEMANN: Well, naturally I dont know what steps theMinistry took, but I assume that the Ministry tried to get the PartyChancellery to give its consent for the Kreisleiter to be interrogated;again and again I suggested to the Ministry to take such a step.Q. But you heard nothing further from the Ministry, is that right?A. No, no, I heard no more later on, because--well, I dont reallyknow why they didnt write again. I have already told you thattransportation difficulties were great, and that it became more andmore difficult to keep in touch by letter or by telegram. For example,since the middle of March--or anyway I think it must have been sincethe middle of March--we were still in a sort of cauldron, we inDuesseldorf were cut off on all sides from the outside world.PRESIDING JUDGE BRAND: In March 1945?WITNESS HAGEMANN: Excuse me. What is it you mean? Whathappened in March 1945? You mean it was then that Duesseldorf became acauldron? You mean it was then that we became cut off in Duesseldorf?Q. Yes.A. Yes, I think it must have been in March 1945, but naturally thedifficulties had been great before that time, I mean the transportationdifficulties, and they grew worse and worse.DR. SCHILF: Mr. Hagemann, did you ever hear that that manKluettgen was recently sentenced to death by an American MilitaryTribunal?[305]WITNESS HAGEMANN: Yes, Dr. Haensel told me that a few daysago. He told me that he had read in the paper that Kluettgen had beensentenced to death in Dachau by an American Military Tribunal.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *_CROSS-EXAMINATION_MR. LAFOLLETTE: After you communicated with Dr. Mettgenbergabout your trouble with the case, did you ever get an answer back fromhim?WITNESS HAGEMANN: Youre now referring to the first case, areyou? Youre referring to the Kluettgen case, are you?Q. Yes, Im referring to the Kluettgen case.A. Yes, I talked to him over the telephone and then I received anorder from the Ministry to the effect that they agreed with my plan toclear up the matter and that in particular the Kreisleiter was to beinterrogated. I was also instructed that I should make a further reportand that probably further directives would be issued to me. Naturally,I had to wait for the instructions from the Minister. Whether it wasDr. Mettgenberg who had signed that order or whether it was Dr. Vollmerwho was then ministerial director, I naturally cant tell you, for ofcourse I was interested in the case as such but not in the man whosigned it.Q. And before you could do any more, you had to wait for instructionsfrom the Ministry in all cases where Allied fliers had been shot; isthat right?A. Well, that is the way I remember that circular decree but that isthe only case that occurred in my area, and the instructions were tothe effect to clear up the matter.DR. SCHILF: I have no further questions.PRESIDING JUDGE BRAND: The witness is excused.          EXTRACTS FROM THE TESTIMONY OF DEFENDANT KLEMM[306]_DIRECT EXAMINATION_       *       *       *       *       *       *       *DR. SCHILF (counsel for defendant Klemm): We now come to thenext charge of the indictment. You are personally made responsiblein the indictment for having assisted in the so-called lynch justiceon the part of the German population exercised on bailed-out Alliedfliers during the war. May it please the Tribunal, the documents whichwere introduced against the witness in that connection are NG-364,Prosecution Exhibit 108; 635-PS, Prosecution Exhibit 109; and NG-149,Prosecution Exhibit 110.[307] According to Exhibit 108 which we alreadydiscussed a few days ago, Bormann had sent a secret letter from theFuehrer Headquarters to the Nazi Party which was addressed to Gauand Kreisleiter. He spoke about lynch actions which had already beentaken by the people and it says further, and I quote: no police orcriminal proceedings have been taken against citizens who have takenpart herein. He is speaking in the past tense. Exhibit 109 showscorrespondence between Lammers and Thierack. Lammers informs Thierackabout this circular letter sent out by Bormann. First, I want to askyou, in what relationship did you see these statements of Bormann tothe Kreisleiter and Gauleiter to Thierack at the time?DEFENDANT KLEMM: According to the text of Lammers letter,Exhibit 109, there must have been an enclosure in this letter.Q. At the time[308] did you obtain knowledge of Exhibit 109 and theenclosure, as you call it, Exhibit 108?A. Yes, I saw Lammers letter and I must have seen this circular letterof Bormanns together with it.Q. Bormann spoke about three of those cases which had occurred inthe past. Bormann stated that penal prosecution did not take place.When you saw these two letters--when these Exhibits 108 and 109 weresubmitted to you--did you know anything about it, that is that in thepast the administration of justice, that is the courts abstained frompenal prosecution against members of the German population?A. I consider that that is absolutely impossible. If penal prosecutionwould have been abstained from, this could have been done only byquashing the trial, and for such a quashing Hitler was competentexclusively or the Minister of Justice to the extent to which thisright had been delegated to him by Hitler. This can be seen from theclemency regulations which have already been introduced as a documenthere, in part. I cannot remember such a case being discussed, and Icannot find anything in these reports about it either. I looked at themwith that in mind.Q. If you say that at the time when you received this letter you didnot know any past cases, how should one understand Bormanns letter? Heis speaking of the past and says that penal prosecutions did not takeplace.A. This can only be explained as follows: According to the letter,before it was sent out, such cases must have occurred. Himmler hadalready in 1943 instructed his police not to interfere in disputesbetween the German population and terror fliers which had been shotdown.[309] This was already brought out in the IMT trial. Thissentence which Bormann used in his circular letter can be explainedin my opinion only as follows, namely: that the police did notforward denunciations to the administration of justice and that inthis way a penal prosecution did not take place, but only because theadministration of justice did not hear anything about these matters.From the hint that Lammers gives in this letter that Himmler hadalready informed his police also on the basis of Bormanns circularletter, it is quite clear to me that such denunciations to theadministration of justice were also not to be made in the future. But,of course it could happen that the administration of justice found outabout such cases on its own and took them up, but incidentally, thatHitler backed this action himself is in my opinion shown in Exhibit 110.Q. Mr. Klemm, Exhibit 108 and 109 bear your initials. I now want to askyou, were these statements submitted to you before they were submittedto Thierack or after that?A. I received these documents after Thierack had seen them and after hehad already made his notation on them.Q. This notation by Thierack reads as follows: IV R-V with theaddition that such cases for the purpose of examination in regard toquashing shall be submitted to me, that is to me Thierack, that isThieracks notation. What do you have to say about that? How did youunderstand that notation?A. The prosecution submitted this document with a supplementarysheet and this says, at least in the German edition of the document,handwritten note on the right upper corner, signed Klemm. That isnot right. There isnt any handwritten notice in the upper right handcorner at all but merely a Kl, my initials. Below the initials, thatis, about the upper one third of the page, there is the notation whichhas just been quoted which was written by Thierack. The handwrittennote is without doubt in Thieracks handwriting. If the original wereavailable and not merely a photostat, one would be able to see thatthis note was written with a green pencil. That was the color in whichministers had to sign, according to the business regulations for thehighest Reich authorities. Whereas in a purple pencil only my initialsare on this document.Every one of the defendants here, if he has been in the ministry, wouldbe able to testify whether that was my handwriting or not.PRESIDING JUDGE BRAND: What is the exhibit number on thatagain?DR. SCHILF: Exhibit 109, Your Honor, 109; 635-PS. But may Iremark it is a later sheet. The prosecution submitted Exhibit [108 andExhibit] 109 at two different times in two parts.Now, Mr. Klemm, I want to ask you--DEFENDANT KLEMM: I want to make an additional explanation. Thefigure IV means department IV. R-V means Rundverfuegung, circularorder, with the addition that such cases are to be submitted to me,that is Thierack, and are to be submitted not for quashing but for thepurpose of examining the question of quashing if they were pending.Thus, a quashing was not considered from the very beginning.Q. Did this instruction issued by Thierack have any possibility ofinciting the population to lynch Allied fliers, or how did you look atit at the time?A. After the Minister had issued this instruction to Department IVand thus had arrogated the decision in regard to this to himself, Ino longer had a possibility to undertake anything in the matter. Thiscircular order was issued with the stamp secret on it if it was sentout at all, and I dont know that. And one cannot talk about incitingthe population for the reason that the population did not hear about itat all. However, after Bormann had informed the Party in this mannerand after Himmler had issued his instructions to the police, it was theduty of Thierack to take some measures in regard to the prosecutionsin the country. I have already stated that the administration ofjustice was unwilling, and Thierack was unwilling too, to grant freedomfrom prosecution without any conditions like that. Thus, if theadministration of justice wanted to carry out a trial, the Minister hadto assert his authority and to protect the local prosecutors againstany elements of the Party or the police who would like to prevent sucha penal prosecution. If a proceeding was to be quashed, however, onlythe Minister himself could do that, because of the regulations by law.What were the consequences of this circular order in the administrationof justice, I can no longer remember. It may be one or two very specialcases were quashed. I do not know whether there were more such cases.Q. You said that the administration of justice and Thierack, too,turned against Bormanns methods. Can you cite examples for this?A. The Party did not only require that those people who participatedin lynchings should not be punished, but on the contrary, it wanted tohave severely punished those people who treated fliers who had beenshot down in a humane manner; and they wanted to have them punishedwith the aid of the regulations regarding the forbidden contact withprisoners of war. We did not concur with either of those measures. Ina case which took place in Magdeburg, the Party attempted to achievethe most severe punishment of a couple which had given food to an enemyflier who had been shot down and who had received a piece of candy fromhim. This was stopped. We had received a report according to which acouple was arrested because they had allowed an Allied flier who hadbeen shot down, into their apartment. The Canadian--I believe he wasa Canadian flier--had been taken prisoner during the air raid, thatis, before the all clear signal, by a civilian, and the civilian tookhim into his apartment. In this apartment the flier received somethingto drink and the Canadian offered the wife a piece of candy. At firstthe woman refused it. When he offered it the second time, however,she accepted it. She then put the piece of candy away and said,That is for the children. The Party had achieved it with the localadministration of justice that the married couple was arrested and thatan indictment would be filed for illicit contact with prisoners of warin a very serious case. When I heard about this report--I shall shortenthis description somewhat--I reported this case very emphatically toDr. Thierack, and during the very same night he called up the ChiefPublic Prosecutor in Magdeburg and instructed him to have the marriedcouple released immediately the next morning.Q. Mr. Klemm, that is sufficient. I shall submit an affidavit aboutthis incident. I only want to ask you now, those were cases in whichGermans were prosecuted because they were supposed to have treatedAllied prisoners of war too leniently. Can you also cite the oppositecases where the Reich administration of justice prosecuted Germans whoparticipated in lynchings?A. Around the turn of the year 19441945 in Kranenburg that is thedistrict of the district court of appeals, Duesseldorf, the followingcase occurred. An SA leader had, during the course of the air war, lostthree very close relatives of his due to bombing. One noon he passedthe town hall in Kranenburg. There was a guard standing, and with himhe had two captured paratroopers. This SA leader went over to him andshot the two captured paratroopers. We prosecuted that case and eventhough the police as well as the Party offices offered considerableresistance, these discussions were advanced energetically. I do notknow the final outcome, because later on due to the events of the warthis territory was occupied by the Allied troops.Q. May it please the Tribunal, may I say briefly I have the approvalof the Court already to submit these files of the General PublicProsecutor of Duesseldorf. I do not have them here as yet. When Ireceive them, I shall then submit them in evidence.Mr. Klemm, briefly in regard to Exhibit 110, which you have alreadymentioned, terror fliers, secret military matter, that is how it iscalled; and a note. Did you find out anything about that?A. These are Wehrmacht files and a correspondence with the ForeignOffice, and the problem was to not let terror fliers obtain the statusof prisoners of war.Q. Let me interrupt you; you do not have to discuss it. Did you findout about the matter at the time?A. The administration of justice neither took part in this case nor didwe know anything about it.Q. The prosecution, furthermore, submitted document 1676-PS,Prosecution Exhibit 417.[310] It is an article which appeared in theVoelkischer Beobachter on 2829 May 1944. The prosecution asserts thatfrom this article of Goebbels in the German press, one can read anindictment of the population to administer lynch justice. Did you findout about this article at the time?A. I did not have knowledge of this article at the time. It was notthe cause for Thieracks circular letter, which was issued for quitedifferent reasons; as I just described, it was issued for legalconsiderations. Moreover, according to the affidavit in DocumentNG-1306, Prosecution Exhibit 440, the issuance of this circular lettermust have occurred at a time which shows that it could have had noconnection with this article in the newspaper.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *_CROSS-EXAMINATION_       *       *       *       *       *       *       *MR. LAFOLLETTE: * * * Now we will consider the matter of theAllied fliers. That document is Exhibit 108 and 109.[311] NG-364,Prosecution Exhibit 108 was the circular letter from Bormann dated 8June [30 May] 1944, and Exhibit 109 is Document 635-PS. You testifiedyesterday--I mean Friday morning--that the notation by Thierack wason Exhibit 108 [Exhibit 109] reading, IV circular with the additionthat such cases are to be submitted to me when they arrive for anexamination of the question in quashing. That was on there when thedocument reached you. We are in agreement on that, are we not?A. It was an instruction to Division IV to draft such a circular decreewith these contents for the purpose of examining whether the caseshould be quashed.Q. Yes. Now then, you also said, From the hint that Lammers gives inthis letter--that is Exhibit 109--that Himmler had already informedhis police also on the basis of Bormanns circular letter, it is quiteclear to me that such denunciations to the administration of justicewere also not to be made in the future but of course it could happenthat the administration of justice found out about these on its ownand took them up, but incidentally Hitler backed that action itself.Do you recall, did you do anything after 4 June 1944 when you receivedthis notation from Thierack about this subject of quashing sentences ordid you let the matter drop?A. I was not able to do anything, since the minister had orderedthat this circular decree would be drafted and these cases had to bereported too, because according to the circular letter by Bormann tothe Party and according to the information by Lammers that Hitlerhad instructed the police, the public prosecution had to get intodifficulties if it found out about such a case, and if it started aninvestigation.Q. Did you personally take any steps to see that there would be noprosecutions against anyone who followed Bormanns instructions?A. I know for sure, and I have already described, that we did carryout a proceeding against the party and the police. We continuedinvestigations, and furthermore, I testified that I cannot recall withcertainty any more whether, on the other hand, one or two cases inwhich there was a special situation was quashed. I cannot recall thatany more with certainty.Q. But you yourself gave no instructions to prosecutors on this linebecause that was Thieracks order, wasnt that right?A. Yes, that was Thieracks order that the public prosecutors weresupposed to report on these matters; after they had reported, theMinister had to decide whether the investigation and the case were tobe continued or whether the proceedings should be quashed. This meansthat the instructions for the purpose of examination were for thepurpose of examining whether the proceedings should be quashed.       *       *       *       *       *D. The Making and Application of Special Measures Concerning Nationalsof Occupied Territories, Minority Groups and Races, and AllegedAsocials                            1. INTRODUCTIONUnder National Socialist ideology and practice a large number of Germannationals were considered inferior or objectionable on racial andpolitical grounds. After Hitler came to power in January 1933, Germannationals were subjected to various discriminatory laws and practices,including protective custody in the hands of the police (usually theGestapo or Secret State Police) or confinement in concentration camps.After Germany occupied the territory of neighboring countries, thesepractices were extended to non-German nationals. As the war progressed,the intensity of discrimination and persecution increased.In the Justice case, one of the most important issues was the mannerin which German criminal law was extended to the occupied countries.German penal legislation and special legislation applicable to Poles,Jews, and others was introduced in that part of western Poland usuallyreferred to as the Incorporated Eastern Territories. Evidenceconcerning this aspect of the case appears below in section D2. (Asimilar type of question arose in cases where persons who were notGermans were compelled to work in Germany and accused of treason, ofundermining Germanys defensive strength, or of being public enemies.See section E, below.) In the occupied western areas the applicationof the Night and Fog decree was the principal measure involving thejudicial process which affected the life and liberty of non-Germannationals. Evidence concerning this matter appears below in section D3.                  2. JEWS, POLES, GYPSIES, AND OTHERS    PARTIAL TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT NG-629    PROSECUTION EXHIBIT 28    [Also Rothenberger Document 3    Rothenberger Defense Exhibit 3]EXTRACTS FROM A REPORT[312] ON A CONFERENCE OF DEFENDANT ROTHENBERGERAND VARIOUS COURT PRESIDENTS, 1 FEBRUARY 1939, CONCERNING RACEPOLLUTION, EXCLUSIONS OF JEWS FROM EMPLOYMENT, AND THE LEGALTREATMENT OF JEWSReport on the conference of [court] presidents on 1 February 1939Present:   Senator Dr. Rothenberger,   Attorney General Dr. Drescher,   Vice President Letz,   District Court Presidents Korn and Dr. Ruether, Bremen,   Local Court President Dr. Blunk,   Local Court Directors Schwarz, Boehmer, Hansen, and von Lehe,   Senior Judges of Local Court Gersdorf and Stender,   Chief Public Prosecutor Lohse, Bremen,   Oberlandesgerichtsrat Dr. Segelken   and the undersigned.[313]Senator Dr. Rothenberger and the attorney general reported on thediscussions at the meeting of the presidents of the courts of appealand attorneys general with the Reich Minister of Justice.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *II a. The Chief Public Prosecutor then spoke again on the treatment ofwomen in cases of race defilement. The Fuehrer refuses an extension ofculpability according to the blood protection law [Blutschutzgesetz].Concerning complicity he pointed out the contradictory opinions ofpolice and justice. The public prosecutors are to work according to thefollowing directives:If a woman merely denies the intercourse she will not be prosecuted. Onthe other hand, if the woman was an active accomplice--if she concealedthe race defiler for instance--she will be prosecuted. If, at the sametime, there are other offenses (perjury) complicity is to be omittedfrom the indictment. In such cases, however, a report is to be made tothe Reich Minister of Justice.Senator Dr. Rothenberger pointed out once more that it is the Fuehrersdesire that the woman should not be punished. If, by mistake however,any person should be indicted or if according to the results of themain proceedings punishment because of complicity may be expected, theproceedings are to be quashed in all circumstances. He urged that thejudges be instructed accordingly.II b. The Chief Public Prosecutor then discussed the problem ofprosecuting women for failing to register illegitimate births. In thiscase the Fuehrer is against punishment according to article 169 formere concealment of the identity of the father; because he considersthat in most cases the womans motive should be respected. The womanwill be prosecuted, however, if she gives false information concerningthe fathers identity.Senator Dr. Rothenberger completed this statement by saying that it wasthe Fuehrers express wish that the woman be exempted from punishment;the Fuehrer had not yet made a final decision in the matter of falsestatements. It should therefore be arranged that in such cases theindictment be temporarily postponed according to article 169. Ifnecessary, a legal regulation may be expected in the near future.III. Concerning the extent of the cases tried in accordance with thegangster decree, the Chief Public Prosecutor reports that up to now 15cases have been tried by special court in the Reich territory, mostof them in Hamburg. Care must be taken that accomplices do not escapepunishment through the carrying out of the trial before a SpecialCourt. The complete verdict must, on principle, be submitted before thedeath sentence is carried out.Senator Dr. Rothenberger declared that it would be advisable to makethe fullest possible use of the possibilities of the gangster decree.The Hamburg cases were considered suitable in Berlin. The Ministry hadnow realized that summary courts of the Hamburg type offer the onlyproper solution; they will therefore be maintained.Insofar as Berlin exerts pressure concerning the speed with which theverdicts are delivered, this pressure must not go beyond the field ofthe administration of justice and affect the judges. The verdict mustbe submitted before the death sentence is carried out. In his opinion atypewritten report on the oral verdict, as prescribed for Hamburg, issufficient.He considers that the publication of sensational reports in the presson such trials is extremely undesirable; there was general agreementon this. Senator Dr. Rothenberger promised that he would personallycontact the competent authorities in order to stop such reports in thefuture.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *V. The Chief Public Prosecutor then reported briefly that civilservants with Jewish blood are on principle excluded from employmentand that it is necessary to make a report on exceptions.No pressure is to be put on civil servants to induce them to subscribeto the Party newspapers.VI. Senator Dr. Rothenberger then stated the ministrys opinion onvarious special questions concerning the legal treatment of Jews.(1) In cases where a Jew asks a bailiff to execute a sentence againstan Aryan, the bailiff is not authorized to refuse to do so.(2) Aryan tenants of a Jewish landlord are obliged to pay rent.(3) Jews enjoy protection against eviction and tenants protection tothe same extent as Aryans.(4) The order suspending execution also applies to Jews in accordancewith the laws in effect. There may be exceptions in individual cases,when it is purely a matter of opinion, for example when a radio isseized.[314](6) The fact that a debtor is a Jew should as a rule be a reason forarresting him. However, it depends upon the individual case.(7) Security for the costs of litigation must not be demanded from aJew to a larger extent than from anybody else.(8) Naturally, a Jew may be heard as a witness, but extreme caution isto be exercised in weighing this testimony. Senator Dr. Rothenbergerrequested that no verdict should be passed in Hamburg, when a sentencewould exclusively be based on the testimony of a Jew.Senator Dr. Rothenberger then requested the presiding and supervisingjudges to accordingly and urgently call the attention of the judgesconcerned to the questions dealt with.

I East 40/40  4024Enclosures: 3 draftsI request agreement as soon as possible to the drafts enclosed--(_a_) An order concerning the abolition of the district court ofappeal at Marienwerder, and the modification of the court district.(_b_) An order concerning the court organization and courtconstitution in the Incorporated Eastern Territories.(_c_) An order concerning the taking effect of legal regulationsin the sphere of the administration of criminal law in the IncorporatedEastern Territories.[317]An additional draft concerning the introduction of legal regulations inthe sphere of the administration of civil law will be dispatched at thesame time.I have likewise asked the Reich Minister of Economics and the ReichMinister for Public Enlightenment and Propaganda for their agreementwith regard to article 1, I, Nos. 8, 10, and 11 of draft (c).Furthermore, I have asked for the agreement of the Reich Protector forBohemia and Moravia concerning article 1, II, No. 2 of draft (c). Theorganization of the courts in the Incorporated Eastern Territories wascompleted several months ago, and German courts are working everywherethere and applying German law, without this application of law havingfound its legal basis. The Reich governor of the Reich Gau Warthelandin a letter dated 11 December 1939 told me that it is now desirablefor the application of German law by German courts to receive a legalbasis. Likewise the Reich governor of the Reich Gau Danzig/WestPrussia had me informed that it would conform to his wishes if theGerman law were henceforth introduced legally in the IncorporatedEastern Territories. The introduction of German law is also necessary,because the regulation for the prevention of acts of violence in theIncorporated Eastern Territories, prepared by the Ministry of theInterior, tacitly implies the application of German criminal law andcourt constitutional law.I note the following concerning the individual drafts:1. Draft (_a_)--In this draft I have summarized those regulationsfrom the draft of an order concerning court organization in theIncorporated Eastern Territories which I had dispatched together witha letter dated 26 October 1939--Ia-9-1961, according to which thedistrict court of appeal at Marienwerder is to be abolished. At thesame time the draft contains the measures necessary in this connection,and those for the relevant delineation of the court districts in theterritory of the former Free City of Danzig.2. Draft (_b_)--This draft regulates the court organization in theIncorporated Eastern Territories, with the exception of the territoryof the former Free City of Danzig; at the same time it introduces courtconstitutional regulations, valid in the old Reich, into these parts ofthe territory.3. Draft (_c_)--Reference to article 1--The temporarymodifications of the law concerning criminal procedure contained inarticle 1, II, Nos. 1 and 2, are expressly desired by both Reichgovernors, and are essential with regard to the special circumstancesin the Incorporated Eastern Territories.The modification of the regulation of the Special Court dated 21 March1933[318] provided for in article 1, IV, entitles the Special Courtsin the Incorporated Eastern Territories temporarily to assume thecharacter of a civilian court martial to a still greater extent.Reference to articles 5 and 7--As, according to article 5, theexecution of punishment is provided for to a certain extent on thebasis of Polish verdicts, a reopening of the trial must be renderedpossible for which German law is applicable. In addition there is anecessity to carry out anew legally closed Polish criminal proceedingsin cases which have to be given special consideration. However, thisshould only occur in accordance with my order as set forth in article5, section 2.Reference to article 6--The regulation shall make it possible thatdangerous habitual criminals and dangerous sexual criminals be renderedharmless by the subsequent order for protective custody or castration.Reference to article 10--Thus, the actual German criminal law is alsodeclared applicable to those crimes which were committed before thedecree became effective in the Incorporated Eastern Territories. Butin accordance with article 1, II, number 1, prosecution need not beenforced; also the public prosecutor only prosecutes if public interestrequires subsequent punishment.In consideration of the fact that the introduction of German law in theIncorporated Eastern Territories is imperative for reasons of legalsecurity, may I request that the affair be expedited?

Comment--The Minister of Justice transmits a letter addressedto the Supreme Reich Agencies containing two drafts of the ordersconcerning the introduction of the German civil and commercial lawin the Incorporated Eastern Territories. He asks for the submissionof wishes for possible alterations. The drafts provide for theintroduction of the entire civil and commercial law in the IncorporatedEastern Territories, excluding only the tenant protection law, thehereditary farm law, and the law for the clearance of debts andreduction of interest. Fundamentally, the German law as applicable inthe Reich proper must be introduced; it will, however, be adapted byspecial supplementary regulations for the districts formerly under thejurisdiction of Austrian law.The Minister of Justice justifies this by stating that the judges _defacto_ already apply the German law, since they are in practiceunable to interpret the Polish law. Although it was suggested duringa conference of the under secretaries in the autumn of this year thatmore discretion should be used when introducing the German law forthe present, the competent Reich governors now deem the introductionnecessary; Reich Governor Greiser expressed this also in writing, asmay be seen from the letter from the Minister of Justice, dated 3February 1940, a copy of which is enclosed. The Minister of Justiceasks that the introduction be effected at an early date.No comments are necessary.2. Duly submitted to the Reich Minister.

As soon asthe decree issued on 5 September 1939 by the Commander in Chief of theArmy had introduced the Special Courts in the Incorporated EasternTerritories, I tried to make these courts, with their particularlyprompt and energetic procedure, centers for combating all Polish andJewish criminals. That I succeeded is shown by the very impressivenumbers of cases dealt with by the Special Courts during the first 10months of their activity in the Incorporated Eastern Territories. TheSpecial Court in Bromberg, for instance, has sentenced 201 defendantsto death, 11 to penal servitude for life, and 93 to terms of penalservitude amounting to 912 years in all, thus an average 10 yearspenal servitude for each individual. Only crimes of lesser significancewere indicted at the local courts. On the other hand, the criminalcourts were eliminated as far as possible as an appeal to the ReichSupreme Court against their judgment is permitted, and I wanted toprevent courts which were not entirely familiar with the specialconditions in the eastern territories--even though it be the highestcourt in Germany--from giving a decision in these matters.The aim of creating a special system of law [Sonderrecht] for Polesand Jews of the eastern territories was systematically pursued by thedecree of 6 June 1940,[329] which formally introduced the German penallaw applied in the eastern territories from the very beginning. In thesphere of the code of criminal procedure, compulsory prosecution nolonger exists; the public prosecutor prosecutes only such acts whichhe thinks it necessary to punish in the public interest. The procedureof compulsory prosecution (arts. 172, et seq., of the Code of CriminalProcedure) was rescinded as it seems intolerable that Poles and Jewsshould in this way compel the German prosecutor to issue an indictment.Poles and Jews were also prohibited from raising private actions andaccessory actions.In article II of the introductory decree [of 6 June 1940], specialcases for action [Sondertatbestaende] were annexed to the specialsystem of law in the sphere of legal proceedings--cases which had beenagreed upon with the Reich Minister of the Interior because they hadbecome necessary. It was intended from the beginning that such specialcases for action should be increased as soon as necessity arose. Thedecree for the execution and completion of the introductory decreementioned in the letter from the Fuehrers deputy was meant to meetthe requirements which had become known in the meantime; whereas thedecrees mentioned also in said letter concerning the introduction ofthe right of extradition, and of the law concerning the use of weaponsby persons entitled to the protection of forestry and game laws, areonly remotely connected with the criminality of Poles and Jews, andare intended exclusively to develop the general coordination of law inthe eastern territories. I shall try to bring about an agreement withthe Fuehrers deputy in regard to both the last mentioned decrees, aswell as the decree for the execution of the law for the cancellation ofsentences, and the decree concerning criminal records.On being informed of the Fuehrers intention to discriminate basicallyin the sphere of penal law between the Poles (and probably the Jewsas well) and the Germans, I prepared--after preliminary discussionswith the presidents of the district courts of appeal and the attorneysgeneral of the Incorporated Eastern Territories--the attacheddraft[330] concerning the administration of the penal laws againstPoles and Jews in the Incorporated Eastern Territories and in theterritory of the former Free City of Danzig.This draft amounts to a special system of law both in the sphere ofactual penal law and that of criminal procedure. In this connection,the suggestions made by the Fuehrers deputy were taken intoconsideration to a great extent. Paragraph (3) of No. 1 contains astatement of facts in general terms, through which penal proceedingscan be taken in future against any Pole or Jew belonging to the easternterritories who is guilty of punishable activities directed against theGerman race, and every kind of punishment is provided. This ordinanceis supplemented by No. 1, paragraph (2), which is already contained inthe preliminary ordinance, and which threatens the death sentence incases of violence committed against a German by reason of his belongingto the German ethnic group. Furthermore, the cases in No. 1, paragraph(4) which are also contained in the preliminary ordinance, are onlycomplements, which would perhaps no longer have been necessary inview of the new general statement of facts, but which I have includedin order not to arouse a false impression that the scope of the actsliable to punishment according to this draft is more restricted thanin the existing legislation. Finally, No. 2 makes it clear that a Polewill in any case also be punished for such acts as are punishableif committed by a German. Furthermore, the ordinance admits a widerapplication of the law in a manner appropriate to the requirements ofthe eastern territories. (Art. 2, Penal Code.)I have already been in agreement with the opinion held by the Fuehrersdeputy, that a Pole is less sensitive to the imposition of an ordinaryprison sentence. Therefore, I had taken administrative measures toinsure that Poles and Jews be separated from other prisoners andthat their imprisonment be rendered more severe. No. 3 goes stillfurther and substitutes for the terms of imprisonment and hard laborprescribed by Reich law other prison sentences of a new kind, viz, theprison camp and the more rigorous prison camp. For these new kinds ofpunishment, the prisoners are to be lodged in camps outside of prisonsand are to be employed there on hard and very hard labor. There arealso administrative measures which provide for special disciplinarypunishment (imprisonment in an unlighted cell, transfer from a prisoncamp to a more rigorous prison camp, etc.).The new kinds of punishment in No. 3 apply to all offenses committed byPoles and Jews, thus also to cases when the criminal commits a crimespecified by the Penal Code. On the other hand, No. 3, paragraph (3),insures that the minimum penalty prescribed by German penal law and amandatory penalty may be lessened if the crime was directed entirelyagainst the criminals own nation.The part concerned with procedure contains first the specialregulations of the preliminary decree existing up to now. In addition,Poles and Jews sentenced by a German court are not to be allowed in thefuture any legal remedy against the judgment; neither will he have aright of appeal, or be allowed to ask for the case to be reopened. Allsentences will take effect immediately. In future, Poles and Jews willalso no longer be allowed to object to German judges on the grounds ofprejudice; nor will they be able to take an oath. Coercive measuresagainst them are permissible under easier conditions. Furthermore, animportant point is that according to No. 10, paragraph (2), the locallycompetent court of appeal decides concerning a nullity plea, whichinsures that no court outside the eastern territories has anythingto do with proceedings against Poles and Jews. Further, No. 12 givesthe court and the prosecution an independent position, meeting allrequirements, with regard to the law concerning the constitution of thecourts and the Reich law of criminal procedure.No. 13 makes the factual special legislation against Poles and Jews andthe elimination of compulsory prosecution apply also in cases wherethe Polish or Jewish criminal does, in fact, reside in the easternterritories, but the crime has been committed in another part ofgreater Germany.In my opinion, a special penal law against Poles and Jews in such aform would neither restrict the liberty of action of German offices andofficials, nor allow Poles and Jews to profit from its introductioninsofar as they would be able then to lodge unwarranted actions andcomplaints against German officials. Factual penal law provides forsuch an increase in severity in the penalties threatened that thesewill act as the strongest possible deterrent. Any hole in the lawthrough which a Polish or Jewish criminal might slip is also closed.In the sphere of criminal procedure, the draft shows clearly thedifference in the political status of Germans on one side and Poles andJews on the other.The introduction of corporal punishment, as discussed by the Fuehrersdeputy, has not been included in the draft, either as a criminalsentence or a disciplinary measure. I cannot agree to this form ofpunishment as in my judgment it would not correspond to the level ofcivilization of the German people.Criminal proceedings based on this draft will accordingly becharacterized by the greatest possible speed, together with immediateexecution of the sentence, and will therefore in no way be inferior tocivilian court martial proceedings. The possibility of applying themost severe penalties in every appropriate case will enable the penallaw administration to cooperate energetically in the realization of theFuehrers political aims in the eastern territories.I intend to have the draft submitted to the Ministerial Council for theDefense of the Reich for approval. I should like, however, to discussthe matter verbally with you prior to that, and to request you ifpossible to get the Fuehrers decision as to whether he agrees with theessentials of the intended regulations.

They have torefrain from every act detrimental to the sovereignty of the GermanReich or to the prestige of the German people.(2) They will be punished by death if they commit an act of violenceagainst a German on account of his membership in the German ethniccommunity.(3) They will be punished by death, in less severe cases with animprisonment, if they manifest an attitude hostile to Germany byhateful or inflammatory activity. Especially, if they talk in a waywhich is inimical to Germany or if they tear down or damage publicannouncements posted by German authorities or offices. Also, if theylower or damage the prestige or the welfare of the German Reich or theGerman people by their conduct in general.(4) They will be punished by death, in less severe cases withimprisonment--_1._ If they commit an act of violence against any member of theGerman armed forces or its auxiliaries, the German police including itsauxiliaries, the Reich labor service, a German authority or office oran organization of the NSDAP;_2._ If they deliberately cause damage to installations of theGerman authorities, or offices, or to things which are used in thecourse of their work or are established for the public interest;_3._ If they encourage or stimulate disobedience against a decreeor ordinance issued by the German authorities;_4._ If they enter a conspiracy for committing any actionpunishable according to paragraphs 2, 3, and 4 No. 13. Also if theyenter into earnest conferences about such actions or declare themselveswilling to commit such or if they accept any such offer. Or, if theyget reliable information about such an action or plan at a time whendanger still can be averted and fail to report it in time to theauthorities or to the threatened person;_5._ If they are found in illegal possession of a firearm, ofa hand grenade, of a weapon for stabbing or hitting, of explosives,munitions, or other war equipment. Also, if they receive reliableinformation about a Pole or Jew being in illegal possession of suchthings and fail to report this fact without delay to the authorities.                                  IIPoles and Jews will also be punished if they violate the German penallaws or if they commit an action which deserves punishment accordingto the basic principles of German penal law, in accordance withthe requirements of national existence in the Incorporated EasternTerritories.                                  III(1) Punishment will be meted out to Poles and Jews in the form ofprison terms, fines, or confiscation of property. Prison terms will bemeted out in the form of prison camp terms ranging from 3 months upto 10 years. In serious cases prison terms will consist of aggravatedprison camp terms ranging from 2 to 15 years.(2) The death penalty will be imposed whenever the law threatens suchpunishment. Also in cases where the law does not provide for thedeath sentence, this penalty will be imposed, if the committed actiontestifies to an exceptionally vicious character or if for other reasonsthe crime is a very serious one. In such cases the death penalty willbe permissible also in the case of juvenile criminals.(3) A lesser punishment than the minimum term of a penalty asprescribed by the German penal code and any degree of punishmentmandatorily prescribed are not to be imposed except in cases wherethe crime is directed exclusively against the ethnic group of theperpetrator himself.(4) _Any fine which cannot be collected will be replaced by a prisoncamp term ranging from 1 week to 1 year._                         2. _Penal Procedure_                                  IVThe public prosecutor will prosecute crimes committed by Poles andJews, the punishment of which he thinks necessary in the publicinterest.                                   V(1) Poles and Jews are to be judged by the Special Court or by thedistrict judge.(2) The public prosecutor is authorized to bring about indictment inall matters before the Special Court. He may file a suit before thedistrict judge if no severer punishment than 5 years prison camp or 3years aggravated prison camp is to be expected.(3) The competency of the Peoples Court remains untouched.                                  VI(1) Each sentence has to be executed immediately. The publicprosecutor, however, may appeal to the Oberlandesgericht from sentencespassed by the district judge. The period set for motions in arrest ofjudgment is 2 weeks.(2) Also, the public prosecutor alone is entitled to the right ofcomplaining. Complaints are decided upon by the Oberlandesgericht.                                  VIIPoles and Jews cannot refuse German judges as being prejudiced.                                 VIII(1) Arrest and preliminary custody are always permissible if there is astrong suspicion of the accused having committed the crime.(2) In the course of the preliminary proceedings the public prosecutoralso may order arrest and the use of other permissible means ofcoercion.                                  IXPoles and Jews serving as witnesses do not take the oath duringproceedings. To all untrue, unsworn evidence presented in courtregulations regarding perjury and unwittingly false oath are to beapplied, according to their sense, to false depositions in court notmade under oath.                                   X(1) The reopening of the proceedings can only be ordered by the publicprosecutor. Request for reopening of the proceedings contrary to asentence passed by the Special Court are decided upon by the latter.(2) The nullity plea is up to the public prosecutor, it is decided uponby the Oberlandesgericht.                                  XIPoles and Jews neither can file private suits nor bring about action ascoplaintiffs.                                  XIIThe proceedings are conducted by court and public prosecutor on thebasis of the German law for penal procedure in full accordance withtheir sense of duty. They may deviate from the regulations given in thelaw about the constitution of courts and in the legal principles forReich penal proceedings, in all cases where it seems practical for thecarrying through of the proceedings rapidly and energetically.                3. _Civilian Court Martial Proceedings_                                 XIIIAs far as the Incorporated Eastern Territories are concerned, theReichsstatthalter (Oberpraesident), with the consent of the ReichMinister of the Interior and the Reich Minister of Justice, for thearea under his jurisdiction or single parts of it, may order thatPoles and Jews be sentenced, until further notice, by a civilian courtmartial. This will take place in cases of serious violence committedagainst Germans as well as on account of other crimes which seriouslyendanger the German construction work.As sentence, sentence of death will be imposed by the civilian courtmartial. The civilian court martial may also refrain from punishmentand may instead pronounce transfer to the Secret State Police.All details regarding the members of the civilian courts martialand their procedure will be settled by the Reichsstatthalter(Oberpraesident), with the consent of the Reich Minister of theInterior.                4. _Extent of the Area of Jurisdiction_                                  XIV(1) The regulations I to IV of this ordinance will equally affect Polesand Jews, who had their place of residence, or permanent abode, withinthe territory of the former Polish state on 1 September 1939, and whohave committed the crime within any other territory of the German Reichoutside the Incorporated Eastern Territories.(2) In addition, the court of the place of residence or abode at therespective time, is locally competent. For that court the regulations,given under V-XII, also apply.(3) Paragraphs 1 and 2 are not applicable to crimes which are sentencedby courts of the Government General.                      5. _Concluding Regulations_                                  XVPoles in the sense of the ordinance are all proteges and statelesspersons who belong to the Polish racial community.                                  XVIArticle II of the ordinance of 6 June 1940,[333] concerning theintroduction of German penal law into the Incorporated EasternTerritories, (Reich Law Gazette I, p. 844) does not apply any more toPoles and Jews.                                 XVIIThe Reich Minister of Justice, in full accord with the Reich Ministerof the Interior, is authorized to issue the legal and administrativeinstructions necessary for the carrying through and supplementationof this ordinance. Dubious questions, regarding the administrativeprocedure, are to be decided by him.

On 20November 1940 the Fuehrers deputy, in a detailed statement, tookthe position that this was a mistake, in as much as the Poles wouldthereby be placed under the German criminal law. The Fuehrers deputydemanded that a special criminal law and a special criminal procedurebe provided for Poland. The particulars are contained in the note of 26November 1940.The proposals, contained in the draft of the decree of the Minister ofJustice and explained in the letter accompanying it, are far-reachingin compliance with the wishes of the Fuehrers deputy.[335] The draftestablishes a draconic special criminal law for Poles and Jews, givinga wide range for the interpretations of the facts of the case, with thedeath penalty applicable throughout. The conditions of imprisonmentare also much more severe than provided for in the German criminallaw. (Instead of imprisonment in jail or in penitentiary--prison campsand special prison camps.) Beside this special criminal law, in asubsidiary way, the German criminal law is applicable. (II.) Provisionsof criminal law which might be used to obstruct the procedure have beeneliminated (the opportunity of the defendant for an appeal, compulsoryindictment, the challenge of a judge, compare also art. XII, S. 2). TheMinister of Justice differs only in two points from the suggestions ofthe Fuehrers deputy--_a._ The Fuehrers deputy considered it more appropriate toauthorize the Reich governors [Reichsstatthalter] (and therefore alsothe two provincial presidents) to introduce the special criminal law,whereas the Minister of Justice provides for its introduction by aReich decree._b._ The Fuehrers deputy considers the introduction of corporalpunishment--the Minister of Justice declines to do so. The Ministerof Justice intends to introduce this draft and have it passed by theministerial council. Under Secretary Schlegelberger desires to discussthis matter first with the Reich Minister and would be pleased if theReich Minister would secure the Fuehrers decision concerning theprincipal features of the intended regulation.

In the Landkreis Ldz it even happened a few days ago thatwhile the Reichsstatthalter was speaking in an old Swabian settlement,a German policeman was stoned to death in a neighboring village.In this case the Reichsstatthalter, according to his report to theFuehrer, gave orders that not only the culprits but 12 hostages aswell should be executed on the spot and under the eyes of the entirevillage population, who were assembled at the spot. In view of thesesabotage acts the Reichsstatthalter asked the Fuehrer for authority toreestablish civilian courts martial. He proposed to appoint the localrepresentative of authority as president, with police officer and asecurity police leader as members of the court. No sentences other thandeath or concentration camp are to be given by these civilian courtsmartial. There must be no possibility of appeal. The Fuehrer decidedthat Gauleiter and Reichsstatthalter Greiser be given authority asrequested to set up the civilian courts martial which he had proposed.The Reichsstatthalter further reported to the Fuehrer that he hadasked you to delegate to him the right of pardon in regard to Polespunished by the courts. The Fuehrer has decided that this desire of theReichsstatthalter is also to be complied with.I beg to inform you of these decisions taken by the Fuehrer and to askyou to take the necessary implementing steps without delay. I leaveit to you to consider whether it is advisable to include this rulingon the basis of the above-mentioned decisions of the Fuehrer, inwhole or in part, in the draft of the decree which you have preparedconcerning the administration of criminal law against the Poles andJews in the Incorporated Eastern Territories and in the territory ofthe former Free City of Danzig.

To the Presidents of the Courts of Appeals and the Attorneys General(with the exception of Prague).2. Through the Reich Protector of Bohemia and Moravia to--The Presidents of the Courts of Appeals and the Attorney General inPrague.Subject: Mild sentences against PolesAttached: 1 compilation          8 additional copies for the Chief Public ProsecutorsDespite my constant allusions to this matter during conferences andin individual instructions, I am time and again notified of sentencesby which Poles in the Reich proper are given entirely insufficientprison sentences for sexual and other serious crimes. Such sentencesreveal an incomprehensibly lenient attitude toward the Polish nationwhich confronts us with implacable enmity. They constitute a dangerto the security of the German people and justify the reproach thatthe administration of criminal law has not proved adequate to thenecessities of war.To make this point clear, the attachment lists a few of suchsentences against Polish criminals which have been changed by specialinstructions or which I had to have altered by way of the nullity plea.I want to express my firm expectation that the officials of the justiceadministration will not fail to recognize the serious danger thisconstitutes for our people; and, last but not least, for the stabilityof the administration of criminal law. I, therefore, expect that fromnow on measures will be taken against Polish criminals in the Reichproper with all the necessary firmness and with the heaviest sentencesin accordance with article 4 of the decree against public enemies.[345]Elements clearly criminal and sexual criminals of Polish nationalitymust, as a rule, be punished by death. That the application of article4 of the decree against public enemies is principally justified inthe case of crimes committed by Poles in the Reich proper has beenrecognized by the Reich Supreme Court in its decision C 258. 41 of 19June 1941 with the following explanations:   If * * * it is noted that entire groups of culprits * * *   possess fewer inhibitions with regard to certain crimes than   the German people in general, the protection of law and order   demands greater watchfulness as to the resulting dangers.   The demand for retribution and the deterrent effect would be   seriously impaired if the administration of justice would grant   such culprits any right of obtaining mild penalties.   The established fact that the defendant, a Pole, sexually   assaulted a German girl should have caused * * * the court to   examine the question of whether or not the characteristics of   a crime, as defined in article 4 of the decree against public   enemies, were present. There is reason to assume that the   defendant in his assault on a juvenile female fellow worker made   use of the absence, caused by war conditions, of male workers   who might otherwise have been able to come to her aid, and   that the circumstances of his crime, in addition, are of such   reprehensible kind that they reveal a criminal possessing the   essential characteristics of a public enemy * * *.In addition to this, it must be considered that Poles are now enteringGermany only as a result of the wartime shortage of German labor andthat as a result of the decrease of police forces, likewise due to thewar, the necessary police supervision over Poles which would have beenpossible under normal peacetime conditions is no longer guaranteed.

ROLAND FREISLER, UNDER SECRETARY IN   THE REICH MINISTRY OF JUSTICE, JANUARY 1942, CONCERNING CRIMINAL                      JURISDICTION FOR POLES[349]The German Criminal Code for Poles by Dr. jur. Roland Freisler, StateSecretary of the Reich Ministry of Justice, member of the Presidency ofthe Academy for German Law.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *                                  II             The objective Criminal Jurisdiction for Poles       *       *       *       *       *       *       *It is not contradictory to justice if criminal jurisdiction forPoles is different from the German criminal jurisdiction. Even if_one_ people within a state can be subject to _one_ [systemof] law only, it is yet quite possible that for another nationalitywithin the same state another [system of] law is applicable. Whetherthis condition should be brought to bear must be determined by thenecessities of the State. It is essential of course that the othernational group can perceive the law in force for its members in orderto be able to abide by it.For there must be a standard whereby it can regulate its behavior. Bythis standard the conduct of its nationals can be judged fairly. Thereis nothing contrary to justice if the one criminal law in its generalaspect is milder, the other, viewed as a whole is severer. After allthere is justice in a sphere of severity as well as in a sphere ofleniency.If the administration of criminal justice for Poles devotes exactlythe same care to the investigation of the facts of a case, as doesthe administration of criminal justice for Germans, viz, avoidingeverything which even very remotely might resemble a judgment onsuspicion, if, besides, it judges the established facts just asconscientiously according to the law applicable to Poles, as it judgesthe established facts in the case of Germans according to the generalGerman penal law, and if, finally, it endeavors to render the rightjudgment in the award of punishment within the compass of the penal lawapplicable for Poles, as within the compass of the penalties pursuantto the general German penal law for Germans, the criminal jurisdictionfor Poles is just, regardless of the different evaluation of actionsof Germans and Poles, which might be necessary in many cases. Thepolitical task of the administration of criminal jurisdiction is not atall incompatible with justice.The directives for arriving at a just decision, especially in the caseof the law pursuant to Number II, in the criminal jurisdiction forPoles are deprived by viewing the German people and Reich as a whole inregard to the necessities of the State, the judicial comprehension ofwhich is given by the political aim of German work in the IncorporatedEastern Territories. Looking at the individual Poles who have beencommitted for trial it follows from the general, legally establishedsubordination law to which he is subject pursuant to Number I, andwhich should dominate and guide his whole conduct. By considering bothpoints, i.e., State necessity and the duty of subordination, no dividedresult can be arrived at in any individual case, because the duty ofsubordination of the Pole in the Incorporated Eastern Territories isa State necessity, and because on the other hand the extent of thisduty of subordination in itself is determined by the aim of the Germanconstruction work, i.e., by State necessity.The German administration of criminal jurisdiction for Poles exercisedin the fulfillment of the Polish task of the German folkdom in theIncorporated Eastern Territories will be characterized by justice justas it is in every other German administration of justice.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *The penal code for Poles has only one form of detention--the punitivecamp. Therefore, this takes the place of confinement in a fortress,imprisonment, penal servitude as provided by the general German penalcode. In the penal registers the punitive camp term will be recorded aspenitentiary [Zuchthaus]. This does not mean, however, that it willbe like penitentiary [service] in every respect. Thus not every termin a punitive camp will be regarded as penitentiary; only a term ofincreased severity in a punitive camp in the meaning of the regulationsfor the noninclusion of the period of detention in custody in theterm of imprisonment for the duration of the war, will be regarded aspenitentiary. However, where no special ruling is applicable, it willhave to be concluded from the recording of the term in a punitive campin the penal register that its legal status is that of penitentiary[service], as far as this can be applied to the State legal status of aPole.The judge may also pronounce a sentence of detention of increasedseverity in a punitive camp. In doing so, however, he does not chooseanother method of punishment. Legally the sentence of increasedseverity term in a punitive camp has to be considered as being the sameas pronouncement of punishment of increased severity in a legal system,which allows the judge the possibility of sentences of increasedseverity.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *From the much increased minimum duration of terms of increased severityin a punitive camp (2 years) and from its increased limit (15 years) itfollows that the judge is expected to make use of it in serious cases,which is also especially emphasized in the decree.In case of death sentences the same methods of execution are in force,as applied by the German Criminal (Penal) Code.By adding fines, confiscation of property, imprisonment, and capitalpunishment the penal code for Poles intends to complete the punitivemethods applicable to Poles.                                  III                    Law of procedure against Polesd. Preliminary proceedings.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *By the general principle of every German administration of criminaljurisdiction, viz, that it must serve to establish actual facts andtheir true judgment--a principle which is adhered to without exceptionand unalterably the freedom of judgment in the arrangement of thepreliminary proceedings finds its unchangeable limit (the same has tobe said with regard to the trial). From this it follows as a matter ofcourse that the public prosecutor in the preliminary proceeding willhave to examine all evidence, extenuating as well as aggravating, andinvestigate it.It is just as self-evident that in the place of preliminaryproceedings by the public prosecutor and the decision of the publicprosecutor concerning the indictment and abatement there can be noKlageerzwingungsverfahren[350] on the part of a private person inconsideration of the principle of liberty of decision with regardto prosecution or nonprosecution, just as prosecuting authorityno private person can appear as prosecutor, replacing the publicprosecutor neither independently nor as coprosecutor; consequentlythe Pole can be neither plaintiff nor coplaintiff. In order to avoidany misinterpretation in this direction this has been expresslystated already in the decree establishing a penal code. In thedecree establishing the penal code for Poles it is stated expressly:The public prosecutor prosecutes crimes of Poles and Jews * * *.(Number IV) Poles and Jews can take neither civil action nor actas coplaintiffs. (Number XI). From the first of these two legalprovisions it follows also that against the Pole no civil action noraction as a coplaintiff can be taken; the public prosecutor alone iscompetent to prosecute.If the liberty of decision in determining the procedure as well asthe main trial is stressed time and again, on the other hand it mustnevertheless be emphasized that the establishment of the true factsof the case is the purport and the rendering of a just verdict theaim of every criminal proceeding against Poles. Therefore, nothingmay be disregarded which may serve to establish the truth and toarrive at a just verdict. For this it is essential that the accusedis heard,--as long as he does not use this possibility granted himfor propaganda--and that he can defend himself in connection withthe accusation, that he may offer evidence of any kind, that he canexpress himself with regard to the findings of the evidence heard,and that he may have the last word. In cases where difficultiesarise from difference of language it is of course essential that thepossibility of understanding is secured, if necessary with the help ofan interpreter. The judge and all the officials of the administrationof justice always and without exception will speak German. Likewiseall evidence, as far as it is not declared with certainty as beingunsuitable right away, must be fully investigated.The giving of the opportunity to the public prosecutor and the judge touse their own discretion in the arrangement of proceedings was possibleonly because it may be assumed that no German public prosecutor andno German judge in any proceeding conducted by him will ignore theseprinciples.Should that happen, however, in an isolated case, it is to beexpected that the public prosecutor will appeal against a decisionarrived at during a trial exhibiting such fundamental defects withthe legal measures at his disposal. The senates of the four districtcourts of appeal, which are the highest authority in Polish matters,guarantee that they display in these cases by the way in which theydeal with appeals that such high principles may not be left out ofconsideration and that they express this clearly in the reasons givenfor the verdict, although this is not absolutely necessary for theestablishment of the sentence itself, because it is not a revisedjudgment but a sentence on appeal * * *.f. Execution of a sentence.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *Even if every sentence can be carried out immediately nevertheless itis self-evident that the authority carrying out sentences will notproceed to the execution if in a specific case the possibility existsthat the condemning verdict can undergo a substantial change by legalmeasures to the advantage of the condemned person or even be changedinto acquittal. It is completely self-evident that the severest penaltywill not be put into effect before it has the force of law; this isalso impossible because the decision of the supreme authority as to theexecution or nonexecution can only be brought about after the sentencebecomes valid. It has also to be expected that the executing authoritywill stay the execution of the penalty if that authority or the publicprosecutor--perhaps because of new evidence--later arrives at theconclusion that the condemning sentence cannot be upheld, or at leastreckons with the not too distant possibility of such a result of anappeal or of a retrial.The decree contains no specification that the court of appeal, orcourt of retrial, or its president can order a stay of execution ofa sentence. The legislator believed he could abstain from such aspecification, because the attorney general will see to it in the wayof administration that such a stay is brought about at the suggestionof the president. It is not necessary that everything should be orderedin the way of legislation that can be safeguarded in the way ofadministration.g. Legal means--The public prosecutor can lodge an appeal againstsentences passed by the judge of a local court with the district courtof appeal. The period of time within which an appeal is to be lodgedis 2 weeks. (Number VI) The extension of the time limit is explainednot only by the poor rail and postal communications which are sometimeseven worse in the Incorporated Eastern Territories than in other partsof the Reich. Its explanation is to be found above all in the fact thatit is also the duty of the public prosecutor to examine whether anappeal is to be lodged on behalf of the condemned person. The condemnedperson will quite often suggest this to him. The public prosecutor willthen require a certain amount of time in order to examine whether thenew statements and evidence, which the defendant has perhaps given himwhen he suggested such an appeal. For that the summary examination ofevidence offered will often be necessary and will take a few days. Justwhen the public prosecutor is confronted with the question whether heis to lodge an appeal on behalf of the condemned person he will do wellto hold himself more than ever aloof from the bad custom of lodging anappeal as a precaution. For in this case he would raise false hopesand in addition, even if he does not subsequently maintain the appeal,would in the eyes of the condemned divest the judgment of some of itsauthority. He must therefore have time for a summary examination. Fromthis resulted the extension of the time limit for the lodging of anappeal.

Priess of the District Court of Appeal[Marginal note] copy made out for: 3715-1b 1/17 a-cextractThe senator [the defendant Rothenberger] reported that the question ofthe Armenrecht[352] concerning Jews has come into the foreground again.With the district court there were two cases pending. He requested thatcontacts with the judges of the district court and of the local courtbe taken up at once so that a uniform line is followed to the effectthat the Jews be denied the benefits of the Armenrecht. It would beentirely out of the question that Jews be granted the benefits of theArmenrecht subsequent to the present development. This would applyespecially to Jews who had been evacuated, but in his opinion also tothose who had not been evacuated. With regard to the matter it had tobe considered whether or not any material claims of the Jews couldstill be answered in the affirmative. Concerning this question, itmight, however, be practical to maintain a certain reserve.Presiding Judge Korn of the district court had raised certainobjections to the denial, because up to now it was lacking any legalbasis.

[limitedliability company].On 30 June 1937 the plaintiff withdrew from the Prenzlau, Behrens, andLundin G.m.b.H. The firm is now continuing its business as a tradingcompany with unlimited liability of the partners. At the time of thewithdrawal, it had not yet been ascertained that a former employee haddefrauded the firm for the amount of 80,000 reichsmarks. He maintainsthat he retains his share of the claim against Hahn, or rather thosefirms which by default have rendered possible the loss to the G.m.b.H.of so large an amount. The defendants, in the course of the Armenrechtproceedings, have offered 3,000 reichsmarks in settlement of the claim,subject to approval by the Gau economic adviser. The Gau economicadviser, after only a preliminary short comment, gave the followinginterpretation on 6 November 1941:   In reply to your inquiry I state my point of view in detail.   In a lawsuit between a German national and a Jew I consider   the settling of a dispute by legal measures inadmissible for   political reasons. The German national as party in the lawsuit,   pursuant to his clearly defined legal standard derived from   his political training since 1933, can expect that the court   will decide the case by a verdict that is to meet a conclusive   decision on the case. What is expected is a decision which was   arrived at not from purely legal points of view, as result of   a legal trend of thoughts, but which is an expression of the   way in which National Socialist demands, concerning the Jewish   question, are realized by German lawyers. Evading this decision   by a compromise might mean encroaching upon the rights of a   fellow citizen in favor of a Jew. This kind of settlement would   be in contradiction to the sound sentiments of the people, I   therefore consider it as inadmissible.The defendants thereupon refused a settlement with the plaintiff andnow deny they owe him anything.On 6 December 1941 the district court [Hamburg] granted Armenrecht.Subsequently, action was brought in as follows:1. To disclose to the plaintiff what the payments have been, which havebeen made so far to the parties entitled to redress pursuant to theclaim against Hahn.2. To pay defendant 22 percent of the total amounts received, with 4percent interest from the day the action was filed.The court intends now to issue a conclusion based on evidence.3715-1b 1 17                                         13 February 1942To the President of the District CourtHamburg1 DocumentWith regard to the pending case Prenzlau against Behrens and Lundin Ido not intend to approach the economic adviser of the Gau for the timebeing, seeing from the documents that the ultimate beneficiary of theclaim--the son of the plaintiff--emigrated in the year 1938 and hisproperty has therefore surely been confiscated. I fail to understandwhy the court granted Armenrecht to the assignee, a Jew, withoutfirst consulting the authority for sequestration of property. Thecession most probably will become meaningless as it was transferred intrusteeship by the son to the father shortly before his emigration.Please discuss the matter with the judge.

The Race and Settlement Main Office of the Reich Leader SS         Attention: SS Gruppenfuehrer HofmannSubject: Final solution [Endloesung] of the Jewish problem1. The final solution of the Jewish problem presupposes a clear-cut andpermanently applicable definition of the group of persons for whom theprojected measures are to be initiated. Such a definition applies onlywhen we desist from the beginning from including descendants of mixedmarriages of the second degree in these measures. The measures for thefinal solution of the Jewish problem should extend only to full-bloodedJews and descendants of mixed marriages of the first degree, but shouldnot apply to descendants of mixed marriages of the second degree.[354]2. With regard to the treatment of Jewish descendants of mixedmarriages of the first degree, I agree with the conception of theReich Minister of the Interior which he expressed in his letter of16 February 1942, to the effect that the prevention of propagationof these descendants of mixed marriages is to be preferred to theirbeing thrown in with the Jews and evacuated. It follows therefrom thatevacuation of those half-Jews who are no more capable of propagation,is excluded from the beginning. There is no national interest indissolving the marriages between such half-Jews and a full-bloodedGerman.Those half-Jews who are capable of propagation should be given thechoice to submit to sterilization or to be evacuated in the samemanner as Jews. In the case of sterilization, as well as in that ofevacuation of the half-Jew, the German-blooded partner will have tobe given the opportunity to effect the dissolution of the marriage. Isee no objection to the German partners obtaining the possibility ofdivorcing his or her sterilized or evacuated partner in a simplifiedprocedure without [having to observe] the limitation of article 53 ofthe marriage law.3. An exception might be worthy of consideration with respect to thosehalf-Jews whose descendants are becoming members of the German nationalcommunity, and who are finally absorbed by it. If these descendants areto be incorporated into the German national community as full fledgedmembers--which has to be the aim in case of a genuine final solutionof the Jewish question--it seems advisable to protect them from beingtreated as inferiors or from having feelings of inferiority whichcould arise easily out of the knowledge and the bad conscience thattheir immediate ancestors have been affected by the planned defensivemeasures of the national community. For this reason, it should beconsidered whether or not half-Jews whose living descendants are nothalf-Jews should be spared from evacuation as well as sterilization.4. I have no scruples against facilitation of divorce of marriagesbetween racial Germans and Jews. This facilitation should also beextended to marriages with persons who are considered as Jews. Thedivorce will have to be granted upon the request of the German-bloodedpartner in a simplified procedure. I have considerable scruples aboutcompulsory divorces, for instance, on motion of the public prosecutor.Such compulsion is unnecessary because the partners will be separatedin any case by the deportation of the Jewish partner. An enforceddivorce, moreover, is without avail, because, though it cuts themarriage ties, it does not cut the inner tie between the partners;moreover, it does not relieve the German partner from the scorn towhich he is exposed by clinging to his marriage. Finally, a clinging tomarriage on the part of the German-blooded partner is to be expectedonly in the case of older marriages which have endured throughoutmany years. In cases in which the Jewish partner, as a rule, is notevacuated but confined to an old peoples ghetto, the German-bloodedpartner who disclaims his membership in the German community should notbe prohibited from being admitted to the ghetto.                                 [Typed signature] DR. SCHLEGELBERGER_Note_--In view of the present position of the Jews, discussionsare pending in the building whether Jews are to be deprived of theright to participate in a lawsuit and whether some other rulingis to be made concerning their representation before court. Thedecisive factor is whether the immediate removal of all Jews can becounted upon. About 77,000 Jews live in Berlin alone. About 7,000of these have been removed so far. The Labor Exchange for Jews, 15Fontane-promenade--Government Counsellor Epphaus--and the Secret StatePolice (Dept. Burgstrasse--official in charge, Pruefer) have reservedthe Jews, who at present are difficult to replace, who are working inarmament factories and other war essential concerns. Furthermore, Jewsliving in privileged mixed marriages have not so far been removed.On the other hand, all Jewish legal consultants [Konsulenten] inBerlin have been ordered to leave. These Jews are today reserved.Accordingly, it must be assumed that a considerable number of Jews willremain on Reich territory, and particularly in Berlin, for some time tocome.Berlin, 21 November 1941                                        [Typed signature] LUTTERLOH                                                  MinisterialdirigentSenior Government Counsellor Dr. Gramm  Please inform the Under Secretary.

He did not even shrinkback from exploiting--for his Talmudic practices--the conditions causedby the war and the absence of the husband S. who has been conscriptedfor military service.

With sharp words he characterizes the defendant as a criminal,who did not even shrink back from exploiting war conditions for hisshameless activities. As a race defiler and public parasite in thesense of the law, Katzenberger has forfeited his life. Therefore, thedeath sentence should be pronounced against him. The other defendant,Irene S., should be sentenced to 2 years hard labor and loss of civilrights for 2 years.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *In his final statement the Jew Katzenberger eventually tries at leastto save what can be saved.Once more he tries to act the benefactor, in order to appeal to thepity of the judges. With an impudence which only a Jew can muster, hecharacterizes all that has been presented against him, as backstairsgossip and finally even wants to claim Frederick The Great as hisprincipal witness. But the president does not permit a Jewish racedefiler to soil the figure of the great Prussian King. The court thenadjourned for deliberation._Sentenced to death!_ (p. 3, col. 1)When the court reenters the courtroom to announce the verdict one canalready see from the earnest looks of the judges that the fate of theTalmudic criminal has been sealed.As a race defiler and public parasite Katzenberger is sentenced todeath.The codefendant Irene S. gets 2 years hard labor and loss of civilrights for perjury. President of the District Court of Appeal R.points to words in the findings of the verdict, which prove to whatextent the German judges are imbued with the tremendous importance ofthe racial laws. The president brands the depravity of the defendantand stamps him as an evil public parasite. Racial defilement isworse than murder! Entire generations will be affected by it into theremotest future! President of the district court of appeal R. in hisspeech also refers to the guilt of Jewry in this war. If today Germansoldiers are bleeding to death, then the guilt falls upon that racewhich from the very beginning strived for Germanys ruin, and stillhopes today that the German people will not emerge from this struggle.In the case of Katzenberger the court had to pronounce the deathsentence. The physical destruction of the perpetrator was the onlypossible atonement._The end_ (p. 3, col. 1)With the findings of the verdict the sentence of the Special Court hasbecome effective._Why the Stuermer describes the Katzenberger trial in detail_(p. 3, col. 2)       *       *       *       *       *       *       *The Jew Katzenberger was sentenced to death as a race defiler andpublic parasite. This sentence (it is not the first of this kind inthe Reich) was pronounced in Nuernberg and thus honors the city whosename was bestowed upon the racial laws of 15 September 1935. For theStuermer however, this sentence signifies a special satisfaction,because it was the Stuermer which, in a special edition of the year1938, had demanded the death penalty for race defilers.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *If today Jewish race defilers are really sentenced to death, then thisproves that the Stuermer has been a good prophet for many years._Race defilers are public parasites_ (p. 3, col. 4)       *       *       *       *       *       *       *Jewish race defilers therefore will have to take care in the future.They do not risk their freedom only but also their heads and necks.The patience of the German people has become exhausted. It does nottreat Jewish public parasites more tenderly any longer than the publicparasites from our own ranks. In this sense the Katzenberger trial hasreceived a significance which goes far beyond the Nuernberg courtroom._Everything for the German people_ (p. 3, col. 4)The world Jewry will discover that Germany knows how to defend herselfwith the severe measures against Jewish race defilers. Now it willagain write using the old long-tried tactics, about the medievalconditions prevailing in Germany. It will again glorify those poor,deplorable, harmless Jews, who become the victims of NationalSocialist legislation. It will give vent to spite and malice towardGermany.

The defendant Katzenberger is fully Jewish and a German national; heis a member of the Jewish religious community.As far as his descent is concerned, extracts from the birth registersof the Jewish community at Massbach show that the defendant was bornon 25 November 1873 as the son of Louis David Katzenberger, merchant,and his wife Helene ne Adelberg. The defendants father, born on 30June 1838 at Massbach, was, according to an extract from the Jewishregisters at Thundorf, the legitimate son of David Katzenberger,weaver, and his wife Karoline Lippig. The defendants mother LenaAdelberg, born on 14 June 1847 at Aschbach, was, according to extractsfrom the birth register of the Jewish religious community of Aschbach,the legitimate daughter of Lehmann Adelberg, merchant and his wife,Lea. According to the Thundorf register, the defendants parents weremarried on 3 December 1867 by the district rabbi in Schweinfurt. Thedefendants grandparents on his fathers side were married, accordingto extracts from the Thundorf register, on 3 April 1832; those on hismothers side were married, according to an extract from the registerof marriages of the Jewish religious community of Aschbach, on 14August 1836.The extracts from the register of marriages of the Jewish religiouscommunity at Aschbach show, concerning the marriage of the maternalgrandparents, that Bela-Lea Seemann, born at Aschbach in 1809, wasa member of the Jewish religious community. Otherwise the documentsmentioned give no further information so far as confessionalaffiliations are concerned that parents or grandparents were of Jewishfaith.The defendant himself has stated that he is certain that all fourgrandparents were members of the Jewish faith. His grandmothers heknew when they were alive; both grandfathers were buried in Jewishcemeteries. Both his parents belonged to the Jewish religiouscommunity, as he does himself.The court sees no reason to doubt the correctness of these statements,which are fully corroborated by the available extracts from exclusivelyJewish registers. Should it be true that all four grandparents belongedto the Jewish faith, the grandparents would be regarded as fullyJewish according to the regulation to facilitate the producing ofevidence in section 5, paragraph 1 together with section 2, paragraph2, page 2 of the ordinance to the Reich Civil Code of 14 November 1935Reichsgesetzblatt, page 1333. The defendant therefore is fully Jewishin the sense of the Law for the Protection of German Blood.[357] Hisown admissions show that he himself shared that view.The defendant Katzenberger came to Nuernberg in 1912. Together with hisbrothers, David and Max, he ran a shoe shop until November 1938. Thedefendant married in 1906, and there are two children, ages 30 and 34.Up to 1938 the defendant and his brothers, David and Max, owned theproperty of 19 Spittlertorgraben in Nuernberg. There were offices andstorerooms in the rear building, whereas the main building facing thestreet was an apartment house with several apartments.The codefendant Irene Seiler arrived in 1932 to take a flat in 19Spittlertorgraben, and the defendant Katzenberger has been acquaintedwith her since that date.2. Irene Seiler, ne Scheffler, is a German citizen of German blood.Her descent is proved by documents relating to all four grandparents.She herself, her parents, and all her grandparents belong to theProtestant Lutheran faith. This finding of the religious background isbased on available birth and marriage certificates of the Schefflerfamily which were made part of the trial. As far as descent isconcerned therefore, there can be no doubt about Irene Seiler, neScheffler, being of German blood.The defendant Katzenberger was fully cognizant of the fact that IreneSeiler was of German blood and of German nationality.On 29 July 1939, Irene Scheffler married Johann Seiler, a commercialagent. There have been no children so far.In her native city, Guben, the defendant attended secondary school andhigh school up to Unterprima [eighth grade of high school], and afterthat, for 1 year, she attended the Leipzig State Academy of Art andBook Craft.She went to Nuernberg in 1932 where she worked in the photographiclaboratory of her sister Hertha, which the latter had managed since1928 as a tenant of 19 Spittlertorgraben. On 1 January 1938, she tookover her sisters business at her own expense. On 24 February 1938, shepassed her professional examination.3. The defendant Katzenberger is charged with having had continualextra-marital sexual intercourse with Irene Seiler, ne Scheffler, aGerman national of German blood. He is said to have visited Seilerfrequently in her apartment in Spittlertorgraben up to March 1940,while Seiler visited him frequently, up to autumn 1938, in the officesof the rear building. Seiler, who is alleged to have got herself ina dependent position by accepting gifts of money from the defendantKatzenberger and by being allowed delay in paying her rent, wassexually amenable to Katzenberger. Thus, their acquaintance is said tohave become of a sexual nature, and, in particular, sexual intercourseoccurred. They are both said to have exchanged kisses sometimes inSeilers flat and sometimes in Katzenbergers offices. Seiler isalleged to have often sat on Katzenbergers lap. On these occasionsKatzenberger, in order to achieve sexual satisfaction, is said to havecaressed and patted Seiler on her thighs through her clothes, clingingclosely to Seiler, and resting his head on her bosom.The defendant Katzenberger is charged with having committed this actof racial pollution by taking advantage of wartime conditions. Lack ofsupervision was in his favor, especially as he is said to have visitedSeiler during the black-out. Moreover, Seilers husband had been calledup, and consequently surprise appearances of the husband were not to befeared.The defendant Irene Seiler is charged with having, on the occasion ofher interrogation by the investigating judge of the local NuernbergCourt on 9 July 1941, made deliberately untrue statements and affirmedunder oath that this contact was without sexual motives and that shebelieved that to apply to Katzenberger as well.Seiler, it is alleged, has thereby become guilty of being a perjuringwitness.The defendants have said this in their defense--_The defendant Seiler_--When in 1932 she arrived in thephotographic laboratory of her sister in Nuernberg, she was throwncompletely on her own resources. Her sister returned to Guben, whereshe opened a studio as a photographer. Her father had recommended herto the landlord, the defendant Katzenberger, asking him to look afterher and to assist her in word and deed. This was how she became closelyacquainted with the Jew Katzenberger.As time went on, Katzenberger did indeed become her adviser, helpingher, in particular, in her financial difficulties. Delighted with thefriendship and kindness shown her by Katzenberger she came to regardhim gradually as nothing but a fatherly friend, and it never occurredto her to look upon him as a Jew. It was true that she called regularlyin the storerooms of the rear house. She did so after office hours,because it was easier then to pick out shoes. It also happened thatduring these visits, and during those paid by Katzenberger to her flat,she kissed Katzenberger now and then and allowed him to kiss her. Onthese occasions she frequently would sit on Katzenbergers lap whichwas quite natural with her and had no ulterior motive. In no way shouldsexual motives be regarded as the cause of her actions. She alwaysthought that Katzenbergers feelings for her were purely those of aconcerned father.Basing herself on this view she made the statement to the investigatingjudge on 9 July 1941 and affirmed under oath, that when exchangingthose caresses neither she herself nor Katzenberger did so because ofany erotic emotions._The defendant Katzenberger_--He denies having committed anoffense. It is his defense that his relations with Frau Seiler were ofa purely friendly nature. The Scheffler family in Guben had likewiselooked upon his relations with Frau Seiler only from this point ofview. That he continued his relations with Frau Seiler after 1933,1935, and 1938, might be regarded as a wrong [Unrecht] by the NSDAP.The fact of his doing so, however, showed that his conscience was clear.Moreover, their meetings became less frequent after the actionagainst the Jews in 1938. After Frau Seiler got married in 1939, thehusband often came in unexpectedly when he, Katzenberger, was withFrau Seiler in the flat. Never, however, did the husband surprisethem in an ambiguous situation. In January or February 1940, at therequest of the husband, he went to the Seilers apartment twice tohelp them fill in their tax declarations. The last talk he ever hadin the Seiler apartment took place in March 1940. On that occasionFrau Seiler suggested to him to discontinue his visits because of therepresentations made to her by the NSDAP, and she gave him a farewellkiss in the presence of her husband.He never pursued any plans when being together with Frau Seiler, and hetherefore could not have taken advantage of wartime conditions and theblack-out.                                  IIThe court has drawn the following conclusions from the excuses madeby the defendant Katzenberger and the restrictions with which thedefendant Seiler attempted to render her admissions less harmful:When, in 1932, the defendant Seiler came to settle in Nuernberg atthe age of 22, she was a fully grown and sexually mature young woman.According to her own admissions, credible in this case, she was notabove sexual surrender in her relations with her friends.In Nuernberg, when she had taken over her sisters laboratory in 19Spittlertorgraben, she entered the immediate sphere of the defendantKatzenberger. During their acquaintance she gradually became willing,in a period of almost 10 years, to exchange caresses and, accordingto the confessions of both defendants, situations arose which can byno means be regarded merely as the outcome of fatherly friendliness.When she met Katzenberger in his offices in the rear building or in herflat, she sat often on his lap and, without a doubt, kissed his lipsand cheeks. On these occasions Katzenberger, as he admitted himself,responded to these caresses by returning the kisses, putting his headon her bosom and patting her thighs through her clothes.To assume that the exchange of these caresses, admitted by both ofthem, were on Katzenbergers part the expression of his fatherlyfeelings, on Seilers part merely the actions caused by daughterlyfeelings with a strong emotional accent, as a natural result of thesituation, is contrary to all experience of daily life. The subterfugeused by the defendant in this respect is in the view of the courtsimply a crude attempt to disguise as sentiment, free of all sexuallust, these actions with their strong sexual bias. In view of thecharacter of the two defendants and basing itself on the evidencesubmitted, the court is firmly convinced that sexual motives were theprimary cause for the caresses exchanged by the two defendants.Seiler was usually in financial difficulties. Katzenberger availedhimself of this fact to make her frequent gifts of money, andrepeatedly gave her sums from 1 to 10 reichsmarks. In his capacity asadministrator of the property on which Seiler lived and which was ownedby the firm he was a partner of, Katzenberger often allowed her longdelays in paying her rental debts. He often gave Seiler cigarettes,flowers, and shoes.The defendant Seiler admits that she was anxious to remain inKatzenbergers favor. They addressed each other in the second personsingular.According to the facts established in the trial, the two defendantsoffered to their immediate surroundings, and in particular to thecommunity of the house of 19 Spittlertorgraben, the impression ofhaving an intimate love affair.The witnesses Kleylein, Paul and Babette; Maesel, Johann; Heilmann,Johann; and Leibner, Georg observed frequently that Katzenbergerand Seiler waved to each other when Seiler, through one of the rearwindows of her flat, saw Katzenberger in his offices. The witnessesattention was drawn particularly to the frequent visits paid by Seilerto Katzenbergers offices after business hours and on Sundays, as wellas to the length of these visits. Everyone in the house came to knoweventually that Seiler kept asking Katzenberger for money, and they allbecame convinced that Katzenberger, as the Jewish creditor, exploitedsexually the poor financial situation of the German-blooded womanSeiler. The witness Heilmann, in a conversation with the witness PaulKleylein, expressed his opinion of the matter to the effect that theJew was getting a good return for the money he gave Seiler.Nor did the two defendants themselves regard these mutual calls andexchange of caresses as being merely casual happenings of daily life,beyond reproach. According to statements made by the witnesses Babetteand Paul Kleylein, they observed Katzenberger to show definite signsof fright when he saw that they had discovered his visits to Seilersflat as late as 1940. The witnesses also observed that during the laterperiod Katzenberger sneaked into Seilers flat rather than walking inopenly.In August 1940, while being in the air-raid shelter, the defendantSeiler had to put up with the following reply given to her byOestreicher, an inhabitant of the same house, in the presence of allother inhabitants: Ill pay you back, you Jewish hussy. Seiler didnot do anything to defend herself against this reproach later on, andall she did was to tell Katzenberger of this incident shortly after ithad happened. Seiler has been unable to give an even remotely credibleexplanation why she showed this remarkable restraint in the face of sostrong an expression of suspicion. Simply pointing out that her father,who is over seventy, had advised her not to take any steps againstOestreicher does not make more plausible her restraint shown in theface of the grave accusation made in public.The statements made by Hans Zeuschel, assistant inspector of thecriminal police, show that the two defendants did not admit from thevery beginning the existing sexual situation as being beyond reproach.The fact that Seiler admitted the caresses bestowed on Katzenbergeronly after having been earnestly admonished, and the additional factthat Katzenberger, when interrogated by the police, confessed only whenSeilers statements were being shown to him, forces the conclusion thatthey both deemed it advisable to keep secret the actions for which theyhave been put on trial. This being so, the court is convinced that thetwo defendants made these statements only for reason of opportunenessintending to minimize and render harmless a situation which has beenestablished by witnesses testimony.Seiler has also admitted that she did not tell her husband about thecaresses exchanged with Katzenberger prior to her marriage--all shetold him was that in the past Katzenberger had helped her a good deal.After getting married in July 1939 she gave Katzenberger a friendlykiss on the cheek in the presence of her husband on only one occasion,otherwise they avoided kissing each other when the husband was present.In view of the behavior of the defendants toward each other, asrepeatedly described, the court has become convinced that therelations between Seiler and Katzenberger which extended over aperiod of 10 years were of a purely sexual nature. This is the onlypossible explanation of the intimacy of their acquaintance. As therewere a large number of circumstances favoring seduction no doubt ispossible that the defendant Katzenberger maintained continuous sexualintercourse with Seiler. The court considers as untrue Katzenbergersstatement to the contrary that Seiler did not interest him sexually,and the statements made by the defendant Seiler in support ofKatzenbergers defense the court considers as incompatible with allpractical experience. They were obviously made with the purpose ofsaving Katzenberger from his punishment.The court is therefore convinced that Katzenberger, after the Nuernberglaws had come into effect, had repeated sexual intercourse with Seiler,up to March 1940. It is not possible to say on what days and how oftenthis took place.The Law for the Protection of German Blood defines extra-marital sexualintercourse as any form of sexual activity apart from the actualcohabitation with a member of the opposite sex which, by the methodapplied in place of actual intercourse, serves to satisfy the sexualinstincts of at least one of the partners. The conduct to which thedefendants admitted and which in the case of Katzenberger consistedin drawing Seiler close to him, kissing her, patting and caressingher thighs over her clothes, makes it clear that in a crude mannerKatzenberger did to Seiler what is popularly called Abschmieren[petting]. It is obvious that such actions are motivated only bysexual impulses. Even if the Jew had only done these so-calledErsatzhandlungen [sexual acts in lieu of actual intercourse] toSeiler, it would have been sufficient to charge him with racialpollution in the full sense of the law.The court, however, is convinced over and above this that Katzenberger,who admits that he is still capable of having sexual intercourse,had intercourse with Seiler throughout the duration of their affair.According to general experiences it is impossible to assume thatin the 10 years of his tte-a-tte with Seiler, which often lastedup to an hour, Katzenberger would have been satisfied with theErsatzhandlungen which in themselves warranted the application of thelaw.                                  IIIThus, the defendant Katzenberger has been convicted of having had,as a Jew, extra-marital sexual intercourse with a German citizen ofGerman blood after the Law for the Protection of German Blood cameinto force, which according to section 7 of the law means after 17September 1935. His actions were guided by a consistent plan which wasaimed at repetition from the very beginning. He is therefore guilty ofa continuous crime of racial pollution according to sections 2 and 5,paragraph 11 of the Law for the Protection of German Blood and GermanHonor of 15 September 1935.A legal analysis of the established facts shows that in his pollutingactivities, the defendant Katzenberger, moreover, generally exploitedthe exceptional conditions arising out of wartime circumstances. Menhave largely vanished from towns and villages because they have beencalled up or are doing other work for the armed forces which preventsthem from remaining at home and maintaining order. It was thesegeneral conditions and wartime changes which the defendant exploited.As he continued his visits to Seilers apartment up to spring 1940,the defendant took into account the fact that in the absence of morestringent measures of control his practices could not, at least notvery easily, be seen through. The fact that her husband had beendrafted into the armed forces also helped him in his activities.Looked at from this point of view, Katzenbergers conduct isparticularly contemptible. Together with his offense of racialpollution he is also guilty of an offense under section 4 of thedecree against public enemies. It should be noted here that thenational community is in need of increased legal protection from allcrimes attempting to destroy or undermine its inner solidarity.On several occasions since the outbreak of war the defendantKatzenberger sneaked into Seilers flat after dark. In these cases thedefendant acted by exploiting the measures taken for the protection inair raids and by making use of the black-out. His chances were furtherimproved by the absence of the bright street lighting which existsin the street along Spittlertorgraben in peacetime. In each case heexploited this fact being fully aware of its significance, thus duringhis excursions he instinctively escaped observation by people in thestreet.The visits paid by Katzenberger to Seiler under the cover of theblack-out served at least the purpose of keeping relations going.It does not matter whether during these visits extra-marital sexualintercourse took place or whether they only conversed because thehusband was present, as Katzenberger claims. The motion to have thehusband called as a witness was therefore overruled. The court holdsthe view that the defendants actions were deliberately performedas part of a consistent plan and amount to a crime against the bodyaccording to section 2 of the decree against public enemies. The law of15 September 1935 was promulgated to protect German blood and Germanhonor. The Jews racial pollution amounts to a grave attack on thepurity of German blood, the object of the attack being the body of aGerman woman. The general need for protection therefore makes appear asunimportant the behavior of the other partner in racial pollution who,however, is not liable to prosecution. The fact that racial pollutionoccurred at least up to 19391940 becomes clear from statements made bythe witness Zeuschel to whom the defendant repeatedly and consistentlyadmitted that up to the end of 1939 and the beginning of 1940 she wasused to sitting on the Jews lap and exchanging caresses as describedabove.Thus, the defendant committed an offense also under section 2 of thedecree against public enemies.The personal character of the defendant likewise stamps him as a publicenemy. The racial pollution practiced by him through many years grew,by exploiting wartime condition, into an attitude inimical to thenation, into an attack on the security of the national community duringan emergency.This was why the defendant Katzenberger had to be sentenced, both ona crime of racial pollution and of an offense under sections 2 and 4of the decree against public enemies, the two charges being taken inconjunction according to section 73 of the penal code.In view of the court the defendant Seiler realized that the contactwhich Katzenberger continuously had with her was of a sexual nature.The court has no doubt that Seiler actually had sexual intercourse withKatzenberger. Accordingly the oath given by her as a witness was to herknowledge and intention a false one, and she became guilty of perjuryunder sections 154 and 153 of the penal code.                                  IVIn passing sentence the court was guided by the followingconsiderations:The political form of life of the German people under nationalsocialism is based on the community. One fundamental factor of thelife of the national community is the racial problem. If a Jew commitsracial pollution with a German woman, this amounts to polluting theGerman race and, by polluting a German woman, to a grave attack on thepurity of German blood. The need for protection is particularly strong.Katzenberger practiced pollution for years. He was well acquainted withthe point of view taken by patriotic German men and women as regardsracial problems and he knew that by his conduct the patriotic feelingsof the German people were slapped in the face. Neither the NationalSocialist Revolution of 1933, nor the passing of the Law for theProtection of German Blood in 1935, neither the action against the Jewsin 1938, nor the outbreak of war in 1939 made him abandon this activityof his.As the only feasible answer to the frivolous conduct of the defendant,the court therefore deems it necessary to pronounce the death sentenceas the heaviest punishment provided by section 4 of the decree againstpublic enemies. His case must be judged with special severity, as hehad to be sentenced in connection with the offense of committing racialpollution, under section 2 of the decree against public enemies, themore so, if taking into consideration the defendants personalityand the accumulative nature of his deeds. This is why the defendantis liable to the death penalty which the law provides for such casesas the only punishment. Dr. Baur, the medical expert, describes thedefendant as fully responsible.Accordingly, the court has pronounced the death sentence. It was alsoconsidered necessary to deprive him of his civil rights for life, asspecified in sections 3234 of the penal code. When imposing punishmenton the defendant Seiler, her personal character was the first matterto be considered. For many years, Seiler indulged in this contemptiblelove affair with the Jew Katzenberger. The national regeneration ofthe German people in 1933 was altogether immaterial to her in herpractices, nor was she in the least influenced when the Law for theProtection of German Blood and Honor was promulgated in September 1935.It was, therefore, nothing but an act of frivolous provocation on herpart to apply for membership in the NSDAP in 1937 which she obtained.When by initiating legal proceedings against Katzenberger theGerman people were to be given satisfaction for the Jews pollutingactivities, the defendant Seiler did not pay the slightest heed to theconcerns of State authority or to those of the people and decided toprotect the Jew.Taking this over-all situation into consideration the court considereda sentence of 4 years of hard labor as having been deserved by thedefendant.An extenuating circumstance was that the defendant, finding herself inan embarrassing situation, affirmed her--as she knew--false statementwith an oath. Had she spoken the truth she could have been prosecutedfor adultery, aiding, and soliciting. The court therefore reduced thesentence by half despite her guilt, and imposed as the appropriatesentence 2 years of hard labor. (Sec. 157, par. I, No. 1, of the PenalCode.)On account of the lack of honor of which she was convicted, she hadto be deprived of her civil rights too. This has been decided for aduration of 2 years.Taking into consideration the time spent in arrest pending trial:Section 60, Penal Code.

Its success, however, is doubtful as long as it isnecessary to obtain a decision from the Reich Minister of Justicebefore granting amnesties [Gnadenrecht] to Poles and Jews sentencedto death. In view of the peculiar criminal and political situationin Upper Silesia, which is marked by the growing Polish resistancemovement, such delays--especially in wartime--are intolerable.I therefore request you to take steps to have transferred to the powerof granting amnesties--at least for the duration of the war--to Polesand Jews within the province of Upper Silesia who have been legallysentenced to death.I should like to point out especially that according to an articlein the periodical Deutsches Recht, 1941, (p. 2472), the Gauleiterand Reichsstatthalter in the Reichsgau Wartheland [Greiser][358] hasalready been granted similar powers.

Theregulations of article IX, for instance, according to which Poles andJews are not to be sworn in apply to proceedings against Germans aswell.I have found that the special legal status of the Poles and Jews whoare subject to the penal ordinance for Poles is not always taken intoaccount. Reference is therefore made to the following points:1. Proceedings against Germans should be carried on wheneverpossible without calling Poles and Jews as witnesses. If, however,such a testimony cannot be evaded, the Pole or Jew must not appearas a witness against the German during the trial, he must alwaysbe interrogated by a judge who has been appointed or requestedto do so, (art. II, par. 1 of the Order for Execution of 31 Jan.1942[360]--(Reichsgesetzblatt I, p. 52)).2. Evidence given by Poles and Jews during proceedings against Germansmust be received with the utmost caution especially in those caseswhere other evidence is lacking. I request that the Fuehrer orderpublished in my circular decree of 3 September 1941-4103-II a-2-2041/41concerning the interrogation of enemy subjects be applied to Poles andJews as well.3. Proceedings against Germans on the basis of charges preferred byPoles and Jews are only justified if sufficient proof is availablethat such a charge is well founded and if paragraph 153 of the Codeof Criminal Procedure appears to be nonapplicable right from thebeginning. As a rule, a thorough interrogation of the person preferringcharges will have to take place first. The public prosecutor will alsolimit his application to the police in the same way. Coercive measuresagainst the accused German as well as his official interrogation shouldin every case be undertaken only if the suspicion that the German hascommitted a serious offense has been sufficiently substantiated.No information about the result of the proceedings is to be given to aPole or Jew who has preferred charges against a German.

Accordingly,the following will be called up:1. Military unworthy German citizens of the age group 1908 or youngerwho have been sent to the penitentiary for 3 years or less and have notbeen penalized for the same or similar offenses either before or afterthe original offense.2. Military unworthy German citizens of the same age group who havebeen sentenced to the penitentiary for 3 to 5 years for a firstoffense, and have no previous or later sentences.3. Military unworthy German citizens of the same age group who havebeen sentenced to the penitentiary for 3 years (ref. par. 1) _and_who still are _serving their sentences_, in case they have served1 year with good conduct.Concerning paragraphs 13, those called up must be fit for field andtropical service. Individuals with homosexual tendencies, or who werepunished for high treason, or have been ordered to be held in custodyfor security reasons, or to be castrated are not to be called up. Forthose unfit to serve who have been sentenced to and have served upto 1 years in the penitentiary and have otherwise served sentencesfor only minor offenses, the restoration of military worthiness willcontinue as a rule through the pardon channels. These may, as usual,be placed in various units of the army.The measures necessary in the administration of justice according tothis order are put into effect--Pardon proceedings instigated by the local recruiting authorities onbehalf of those sentenced who belong to the age groups of 1908 andyounger will not as a rule be continued. The armed forces replacementoffices concerned will be informed by the pardoning authorities, todesist from further processing of these requests by order of the HighCommand of the Armed Forces. Exceptions are proceedings against those,who have been sentenced up to 1 years penitentiary (see above). Theseproceedings will be acted upon in the manner heretofore customary, andif need be, presented to the Reich Minister of Justice for decisions.The attorneys general will issue a report on the number of convicts whoare still in confinement who come under this category for induction.They will simultaneously compile lists which will contain personalparticulars of those persons sentenced (name, birth-date and town,occupation, sentence, expiration date, behavior, etc.). The list willbe sent to the army office concerned. The named prisoners will awaitthe armys call.                  _II. SPECIAL COMMANDOS IN THE EAST_The Reich Marshal has expressed the wish to have convicts madeavailable to be used as special commandos in the East, and to carryout sabotage behind the enemys lines. He refers to convicts whostrayed off the straight and narrow and have not committed especiallydishonorable deeds, for whose person and deed one may have humanunderstanding. Especially suited are poachers who out of a passion forhunting have trespassed, and smugglers who have risked their lives inbattle on the borders against the custom officials.The poachers are already being turned over to the Reich Leader SS forspecial duties. The number of smugglers who come under considerationis exceptionally small. A telephonic questioning of the 13 districtattorneys located on the borders of the Reich, disclosed only 2suitable smugglers in confinement and three are being investigated.In the case of the latter, the citizenship is doubtful. There are nosimilar groups of convicts for this task who could make any differencein amounts. Under these circumstances it appeared practical to givethe attorneys general the general task of obtaining the convicts,appropriate for this purpose, and reporting them. Prerequisites are,voluntary enlistment, physical fitness for military service, age 18 to45 years, confinement of at least 1 year for a deed not especiallydishonorable. The following are exceptions:_a._ Foreigners, stateless persons, those of non-German blood._b._ Persons who have been punished because of homosexuality orhigh treason, or against who imprisonment for security reasons orcastration has been ordered.The appropriate request to the attorneys general has been made. Thereports are expected before 25 October 1942. They are being checked inthe Reich Ministry of Justice. The names of those convicts appearingsuitable according to this will be made known to the Reich Marshal.Insofar as they fulfill also the prerequisites for induction into theAfrica Brigade, a corresponding reference will be necessary.                  _III. DELIVERY OF ASOCIAL CONVICTS_                       [Asoziale Strafgefangen]Persons in penal institutions designated as asocial persons by judicialdecision are to be turned over to the Reich Leader SS.1. _Persons in custody for reasons of security_--Persons incustody for reasons of security who are in German penal institutionswill be put at the disposal of the Reich Leader SS. The execution ofsentence will be regarded as interrupted by the delivery.In detail the following principles should govern proceedings:_a._ Persons under court martial sentences will not be delivered.Prisoners sentenced by former Polish courts or by courts of theGovernment General, will be transferred; before this, however,agreement with the Governor General will be obtained. The workhouseaccording to Austrian law is not equivalent to security custody[Sicherungsverwahrung]._b._ Whether women are also to be delivered is still doubtful.This question will be discussed with SS Gruppenfuehrer Streckenbach. Inthis regard it will have to be a fundamental point from the beginningthat in the case of female Poles, Jews, and gypsies no doubt about thedelivery can exist._c._ Foreigners are not affected. Poles, Russians, Ukrainians,Jews, gypsies do not rank as foreigners, however, Latvians, Estonians,do. Czechs sentenced by German courts will be handled like Germans._d._ The sick will be delivered, as soon as they are able to betransported. The question whether prisoners in penal institutionswho according to the opinion of the institution are insane should bedelivered will be discussed with SS Gruppenfuehrer Streckenbach._e._ The delivery of persons in custody for security reasonswill take place as a matter of basic principle also in the case ofsuch prisoners who on account of age or for other reasons no longerseem dangerous. An exception will be made only in the case of personsin security custody, in whose case the institution is convinced thatbecause of their favorable development they can be released withina predictable time. These cases will be laid before section XV forindividual checking._f._ Persons sentenced who are still serving penitentiarysentences, but who in addition have been sentenced to security custody,will be put at the disposal of the Reich Leader SS._g._ When delivering prisoners it must be taken into account thatthe production of industries important to defense should suffer nostoppages. Insofar as necessary workers to replace them must be trainedfirst._h._ The question, to whom the delivery will be made, will bediscussed with SS Gruppenfuehrer Streckenbach._i._ In the immediate future only persons who have receivedfinal judgment will be taken; the decision on future sentences is inabeyance. For the reception of persons sentenced later, individualinstitution will be designated, the number of which is to be limited asmuch as possible.2. _Jews, gypsies, Russians, and Ukrainians_ will be delivered tothe Reich Leader SS without exception.3. _Poles_--Ethnic Poles who are subject to the Polish criminallaw regulations or have been delivered to the Polish penal authoritiesand who have more than 3 years sentence to serve will be delivered tothe Reich Leader SS.Poles with smaller sentences will remain in custody of the prisonsystem. After serving their sentences they will be reported by name tothe police just the same.4. _Penitentiary prisoners_--Penitentiary prisoners of the Germanand Czech ethnic groups, who are sentenced to a punishment of over 8years, will be individually checked to see whether they are accordingto their personality, asocial, i.e., whether they will be worthlessforever to the nation. If the answer to this question is affirmative,they will be delivered to the Reich Leader SS.The check-up will be undertaken in section XV (Vice President of thePeoples Court Engert, Oberregierungsrat, Hupperschwiller, Chief PublicProsecutor Meyer). Vice President Engert will regulate the technicalexecution. The decisions in individual cases are incumbent upon him.Special cases will be reported to the Reich Minister of Justice.The guiding principles for those in security custody (III, 1) arevalid, and furthermore the following is to be observed in this regard.On the treatment of Czechs sentenced by courts in the Protectoratea conversation with the Reich Protector is necessary. The questionwhether Alsatians and Lorrainers who have been sentenced in Alsace andLorraine should be taken must be cleared by negotiation with the chiefsof the civil administration.Persons originally sentenced to death whose sentences have beencommuted to penitentiary sentences over 8 years fall under the scopeof the action, insofar as they are regarded as asocial. Under thisrequirement those sentenced persons are also included who have closerelatives in the field, and prisoners for whom, because of theircommitment in the removal of aerial bombs, a later commutation iscontemplated.On the treatment of persons sentenced who are lodged in curative ormedical institutions, negotiations with SS Gruppenfuehrer Streckenbachmust be undertaken.

[Initials] KUE [Kuemmerlein]To Reichsleiter BormannFuehrer HeadquartersSubject: Administration of criminal justice against Poles, Russians,           Jews, and gypsiesDear Reichsleiter:With a view to freeing the German people of Poles, Russians, Jews, andgypsies, and with a view to making the eastern territories incorporatedinto the Reich available for settlements of German nationals, I intendto turn over criminal proceedings against Poles, Russians, Jews, andgypsies to the Reich Leader SS. In so doing I work on the principlethat the administration of justice can only make a small contributionto the extermination[361] of members of these peoples [Angehoerigedieses Volkstums auszurotten]. Undoubtedly the administration ofjustice pronounces very severe sentences on such persons, but that isnot enough to constitute a material contribution toward the realizationof the above-mentioned aim. Nor is any useful purpose served by keepingsuch persons in German prisons and penitentiaries for years, even ifthey are utilized as labor for war purposes as is done today on a largescale.I am, on the other hand, of the opinion that considerably betterresults can be accomplished by surrendering such persons to thepolice, who can then take the necessary measures unhampered by anylegal criminal evidence. I start from the principle that such measuresseem entirely justified in wartime, and that certain conditions whichI consider essential are fulfilled. These conditions consist in theprosecution of Poles and Russians by the police only if they resideduntil 1 September 1939 in the former state territory of Poland or theSoviet Union; and secondly, that Poles who were registered as beingof German descent will continue to be subjected to prosecution by theadministration of justice as before.On the other hand, the police may prosecute Jews and gypsiesirrespective of these conditions.But no changes whatsoever are to be made in regard to the prosecutionof other foreign nationals by the administration of justice.The Reich Leader SS, with whom I discussed these views, agrees withthem. I also informed Dr. Lammers.I submit this matter to you, dear Reichsleiter, with the request to letme know whether the Fuehrer approves this view. If so, I would thenmake my official recommendations through Reich Minister Dr. Lammers.[Handwritten] After one week.[Initial] Kue [Kuemmerlein] 10/19, 10/26                                                  Heil Hitler!                                                              yours                                              [Initial] TH [Thierack]    PARTIAL TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT NG-787    PROSECUTION EXHIBIT 507LETTER OF THE REICH MINISTRY OF JUSTICE TO LEADING JUDGES ANDPROSECUTORS, 4 APRIL 1944, TRANSMITTING A REPORT OF THE REICHSTATISTICAL BUREAU ON CRIMINALITY IN THE GREATER GERMAN REICH IN THEYEAR 1942, EXCLUSIVE OF CASES HANDLED BY THE PEOPLES COURTThe Reich Minister of Justice_4206 III a-4-446_                                             Berlin W 8, 4 April 1944                                             Wilhelmstrasse 65                                             Phone: 110044                                             out of town: 116516To the Presidents of the Reich Supreme Court and the    Peoples CourtsTo the Presidents of the Districts Courts of Appeal and the    Chief Reich Prosecutors    at the Reich Supreme Court and the Peoples Court,    as well as the Public Prosecutors at the Courts of AppealSubject: Development of criminality1 enclosure: 1 copy each of the enclosed report regarding  criminality in the Greater German Reich in the year 1942I am enclosing one copy of the report regarding criminality in theGreater German Reich.

Total result_Since 1 January 1942 the Reich statistics of criminality compriseterritorially the area of the Greater German Reich with the exceptionof the Alpine and Danube Gaue where the criminal law of the Reich asthe exclusive basis of the statistics of criminality in the Reich,has not yet been introduced in its totality. As to _persons_, thestatistics of criminality in the Reich enumerate separately--    _a._ German nationals and aliens (aliens too will be enumerated    separately from 1 January 1943 on).    _b._ Members of the Protectorate.    _c._ Poles and Jews sentenced on the basis of the Penal Ordinance    for Poles.    _d._ Other racial Jews.Taking these individual groups together, a _total_ of 457,129 personswere _sentenced_[362] with legally binding effect in the Greater GermanReich for crimes and offenses against laws of the Reich (not countingsentences for crimes and offenses against laws of the Reich fallingunder the jurisdiction of the Peoples Court) that is, 9.4 percent morethan in the year 1941 (417,923). The number of persons _convicted_with legally binding effect amounts to 417,001--91.2 percent of thetotal number of persons accused; 1941 [amounted] to 377,072--90.2percent. Punishment was inflicted on 372,502 persons convicted (1941:346,105)--89.3 percent (91.8 percent) and punishment and correctivemeasures on 2,449 (3,082)--0.6 percent (0.8 percent).Of 29,305 (1941: 30,540) persons sentenced 6.4 percent (7.3 percent)were _acquitted_. In addition corrective measures were decreed inthe case of 139 (134) defendants who were acquitted, in the case of 487(495) corrective measures were decreed independently, and in the caseof 35 (54) persons a motion to decree corrective measures independentlywas refused.In 10,162 cases (2.2 percent) compared with 9,628 (2.3 percent) in theprevious year, _proceedings were quashed_ by the court.In the year reported on 84,318--20.2 percent of the total number ofpersons convicted, compared with 92,546--24.5 percent in the year 1941,were persons who had been _previously convicted_ of crimes oroffenses against laws of the Reich.Total number of persons convicted--    ------------------------------------+---------------+---------------                                        |     1941      |     1942                                        +-------+-------+-------+-------                                        |Number |Percent|Number |Percent    ------------------------------------+-------+-------+-------+-------    I.

-----------------------------+--------------+------------+--------------+------------Thus, we find an _increase_, to a more or less considerabledegree, in the following crimes: abortion (+6.7 percent), larcenyand aggravated larceny (+15.6 percent and +27.8 percent resp.), andreceiving of stolen goods (+34.9 percent). The three last namedcriminal acts, the most important of which are directed againstproperty, constitute approximately 50 percent of all crimes andoffenses against the Reich Criminal Code recorded for this year. Thesame offenses constituted only 43.2 percent of the total in 1941. Casesof forgery of public instruments also show an increase (+23.6 percent),partly in consequence of the forging of the numerous identity cards andpapers necessitated by the government control of economy. Offenses bybreach of official duties, likewise, have increased in number (+11.9percent). The increase of cases pertaining to the decree againstpeoples parasites is particularly noticeable (+66.1 percent).On the other hand, all categories of sexual crimes have _decreased_ innumber (-22.3 percent), particularly unnatural sexual offenses (-29.6percent) and indecent assault on persons under 14 years of age (-21.9percent). Decreases are also recorded for the various types of willfulbodily injury (-24.9 percent), for the two capital crimes, murder andmanslaughter (-18.2 percent and -21.9 percent resp.), among the crimesagainst property, embezzlement (-7.4 percent), for both robbery andextortion equivalent to robbery (-38 percent) as well as extortion(-31.1 percent) to a considerable extent, and, furthermore, for fraud(-22.8 percent). The decline in the number of convictions arising fromcrimes of violence (-6.7 percent) is also notable._Sentences_ imposed in 1942 (1941) (this covers both fines andimprisonment) are as follows: 2,199 (1,085) death sentences, 20,104(15,981) limited sentences of penitentiary [Zuchthaus] (includingsevere penal camp), 194,386 (162,768) sentences of imprisonment(including ordinary penal camp) and 162,158 (170,254) fines.A comparison between this and last years criminal statistical datafor individual groups cannot be drawn because of the introduction ofa revised system of enumeration, previously mentioned, that went intoeffect 1 January 1942. Until then the Reich criminal statistics had notyet provided such an analysis of individual groups.  _2. Ethnic members of the German national community and foreigners_                            _a._ SentencesIn 1942 a total number of 378,670 persons, both ethnic members ofthe German national community as well as foreigners were legallysentenced within the Greater Reich for crimes and offenses againstReich laws (not including sentences for crimes and offenses againstReich laws falling within the jurisdiction of the Peoples Court).Of these, 341,540, or 90.2 percent were legally _convicted._Penalties alone were imposed on 297,324, or 87.1 percent of thoseconvicted, whereas both penalties and measures of security and reformwere imposed on 2,332 or 0.7 percent. The number of convicted persons,punishment for whom was set aside in accordance with the juvenile courtlaw amounts to 2,911 or 0.8 percent. However, for the vast majorityof these cases measures of reform were ordered and these amountedto 10,233 according to this years record. Juvenile detention wasordered in the case of 37,717 defendants, which means 11 percent of allconvicted ethnic members of the German community (and foreigners), and71.9 percent of the total number of juveniles within this particulargroup who were subject to a penalty. In addition, prison sentences ofindefinite duration were imposed on 1,256 juveniles.For the recorded year 26,544 defendants or 7 percent of the totalnumber, were acquitted. Besides, in 135 instances acquittal was grantedalong with measures of security and reform, in 475 cases such measuresalone were imposed, and in 35 cases motions for measures of securityand reform were rejected._Proceedings_ were _quashed_ by courts in 9,941 cases, representing 2.6percent of the total of persons brought to trial.212,410 or 62.2 percent of the total of convictions of German nationals(including foreigners) in 1942, represent crimes and offenses inviolation of the Reich Penal Code and 129,130 or 37.8 percent representcrimes and offenses in violation of other laws of the Reich.                _b._ Personal Data on Convicted PersonsOf convicted German nationals (and foreigners) 116,754 or 34.2percent in 1942, were _female_ and 52,423 or 15.3 percent were_juveniles_ (ranging in age from 14 to 18). The age group of 18to 21, normally representing the heaviest criminal quota, participatesin the total of convictions only with a number of 34,401 delinquentsor 10.1 percent, due to the drafting of many of these age brackets.The number of persons already _previously convicted_ for crimesand offenses against laws of the Reich amounts to a total of 77,322 or22.6 percent of whom 18,478 or 23.9 percent had more than 4 previousconvictions. 36,419 of the convicted persons or 10.7 percent wereforeigners, of whom 3,064 or 8.4 percent represented juveniles.                     _c._ Individual Criminal ActsChart 1 A[363] affords a view into the criminal structure of 1942.According to this, the various acts of theft form, as previously, thegreater part of the total of convictions (91,476 or 43.1 percent; allof whom are persons convicted for crimes and offenses in violation ofthe Reich Penal Code). If one disposes of insult as a petty and civiloffense (13,516 or 6.4 percent), there follows--though at a greaterinterval--the other two significant offenses against property, i.e.,fraud (11,567 or 5.4 percent) and receiving stolen goods (12,115 or5.7 percent). The fifth place is accorded to sexual offenses (10,205or 4.8 percent) among which the indecent assaults on persons under14 as well as sodomy and bestiality (32.7 percent and 26.2 percentresp.) represent comparatively the greater share of all sexual crimesand offenses. Then follow again two offenses against property, i.e.,embezzlement (9,328 or 4.4 percent) and forgery of documents (8,628 or4.1 percent).In major crimes, murder participates with 117 convictions; manslaughterwith 101, and robbery together with extortion equivalent to robberywith 147 delinquents.If one arranges the above discussed, numerically significant criminalacts in accordance with convicted _adults_ and _juveniles_the following results: Of the total number of adult and juvenilepersons convicted for crimes and offenses in violation of the ReichPenal Code, the percentage is as follows:    --------------------------------+----------+------------                                    |  Adults  | Juveniles    --------------------------------+----------+------------    Petty larceny                   |    33.8  |      49.3    Aggravated larceny              |     3.8  |      17.5    Embezzlement                    |     4.8  |       2.7    Receiving stolen goods          |     6.4  |       2.5    Fraud                           |     6.0  |       2.8    Forgery of Public Documents     |     4.1  |       3.8    Sexual crimes and offenses      |     4.7  |       5.1    --------------------------------+-----------------------In petty and aggravated larceny together, the number of crimesrepresent approximately two-thirds for juveniles and slightly less thanfour-tenths for adults.Due to enactment of laws pursuant to war exigencies, the followingother crimes and offenses deserve mentioning: They are arranged inorder of the number of their convictions.

Detention was pronounced in378 cases.In 1942 juvenile arrest was pronounced against 37,717 juveniles, i.e.,against 71.9 percent of the total number of juvenile delinquents, amongthem were 25,562 arrests or 67.8 percent for a definite period of time.The proportion of chronologically defined terms of imprisonment of morethan 2 weeks to the total number of arrests is 51.5 percent. 12,155 or32.2 percent of the juveniles were sentenced to weekend incarceration,and among them 23.6 percent to the loss of three and four of theirweekly off-times.Of the _protective and reformative measures_ described in article42a of the Reich Penal Code, the following have been decreed withlegally binding effect in 1942:    Placing into a lunatic asylum                                   906    Placing into a reformatory institution for alcohol addicts       90    Placing into a workhouse                                        400    Protective custody                                            1,414    Sterilization of dangerous sexual offenders                     152    Ban on the exercise of trade or profession                      298In greater detail in the period reported on protective and reformativemeasures were decreed e.g., in the case of convictions for indecentassault on persons under 14 years of age; 232 times or 7.0 percent ofthe persons convicted for the offenses in question; for repeated pettylarceny, 334 times or 7.4 percent; for repeated aggravated larceny,195 times or 25.1 percent; and for repeated fraud, 271 times or 20.2percent.                     _3. Other Groups of Persons_The following gives detailed particulars concerning the number ofProtectorate Nationals, Poles and Jews, as well as racial Jews broughtto trial in Greater Germany (exclusive of the Alpine and Danube Gaue)in 1942. -----------------------------------------+-------------+---------+------                                          |Protectorate | Poles   |Racial                                          |  Nationals  |and Jews | Jews -----------------------------------------+-------------+---------+------ Persons brought to trial                 |      13,060 |  63,786 | 1,613   Juveniles brought to trial             |         482 |   5,169 |    44   Percentage of persons brought to trial |         3.7 |     8.1 |   2.7                                          |             |         | Convicted persons                        |      12,117 |  61,836 | 1,508   Percentage of persons brought to trial |        92.8 |    96.9 |  93.5                                          |             |         | Acquitted                                |         871 |   1,816 |    74   Percentage of persons brought to trial |         6.7 |     2.8 |   4.6                                          |             |         | Persons previously convicted             |       2,493 |   4,237 |   266     Percentage of total convicted        |        20.6 |     6.9 |  17.6     Persons with more than 4 previous    |             |         |       convictions among these            |         766 |     593 |    43     Percentage of previously convicted   |        30.7 |    14.0 |  16.2 -----------------------------------------+-------------+---------+------The figures given above concerning the _convictions_ of Poles and Jews,refer exclusively to convictions according to the Penal Ordinance forPoles, that is to say, mainly to such crimes which have been committedin the Incorporated Eastern Territories. However, crimes are alsoincluded which have been committed in other districts of the GermanReich by Jews and Poles, who on 1 September 1939 had their residence orpermanent abode in the territory of the former Polish state (No. XIV ofthe Penal Ordinance for Poles).[365]Contrary to expectations, the _quota_ of Poles and Jews _previouslyconvicted_ is low; this can first of all be explained by the fact thatsome of the criminal records were destroyed in the eastern territories;furthermore that during the fighting in autumn 1939, the Poles openedthe doors of the penitentiaries and released dangerous criminals who,in most cases, turned criminals again and were brought before theGerman summary courts; a great number of those retaken, against whomfresh violations of the law could not directly be proved, were sentto concentration camps as a preventive measure. In both instances,therefore, persons who had previous convictions were thus omittedfrom the census of criminal statistics. Taking these points intoconsideration, the quota of Poles and Jews previously convicted hasstill to be regarded as comparatively high.Particulars concerning the most important _punishable_ actions,committed by the above mentioned groups of persons which have led to aconviction, can be obtained from chart I B.With regard to the penalties imposed upon them by the courts a totalof 1,138 Protectorate Nationals, Poles, and Jews, as well as Jews byrace were sentenced to death during the current year according to chart2. These figures include 930 Poles and Jews sentenced under the crimesordinance for Poles. The total number of penal servitude sentences,imposed for limited periods of time, against Protectorate Nationals andJews by race amounts to 2,237 and the jail sentences amount to 7,321.By virtue of the criminal ordinance for Poles the sentence of penalcamp for hard labor was imposed in 2,017 cases and that of regularpenal camp in 43,180 cases.The total _fines_ imposed, amount to 20,694.85 defendants had their _property confiscated_.       *       *       *       *       *       *        *                               _Chart 2_                _Punishments meted out in the year 1942

I thought of meeting at first the most urgent need within thecompass of my sphere of activity, viz, that of adjusting theadministration of justice from a legal point of view, and moreover Ihad prepared a corresponding draft for the other administration ofjustice belonging to my sphere of activity. However, I did not want totake the initiative to make suggestions concerning matters which arebeyond the sphere of my department._The draft enclosed in your urgent letter_ includes all supremeauthorities of the Reich, especially that of the Reich Ministerand all ministers whose sphere of work is connected with mattersof administrative law. While, as far as the sphere of activity ofthese ministers is concerned I still adhere to the opinion that Ishould refrain from making suggestions on my part, I declare that Ihave no objections against an extension of my draft to matters ofadministrative law and to decisions by administrative authorities.                                              II. 34529 114058II. On the assumption that an extensive regulation of the situation ofthe Jews with regard to legal and administrative decisions is desired,it seems necessary to me that the question of the admissibility fora Jew to _testify on oath_ be legally regulated too, and thisregulation had best be included in the same decree.Therefore, I furthermore suggest that the decree should provide thatthe Jew is not admissible to testify on oath. Thereby the taking of anoath or the furnishing of an affidavit by Jews is in general impossible.In my opinion, however, the fact that the Jew is not permitted to takean oath should not make the Jew have a better legal position than theperson who is authorized to take an oath. Therefore, I further suggestto include a regulation according to which the testimony of a Jew whichcould have been made under oath--if it had been given by a person whois permitted to take an oath--should be treated like testimony givenunder oath as far as criminal cases are concerned. My idea in thisconnection is that the chiefs of the supreme authorities of the Reichshould order administratively that it should be pointed out to the Jewthat he could be legally prosecuted if he commits an offense againsthis duty to give true testimony, but I do not propose to make this aprerequisite of being liable to punishment.In my opinion, comprehensive settlement of the problem requiresfurthermore the exclusion, for reasons of foreign policy, of all Jewsfrom the regulations of this decree who are citizens of a foreignnation.Therefore, under the assumption that the persons participating in thecomprehensive solution of the problem and those supreme authorities ofthe Reich which are in charge of specialized sectors agree, I wouldsuggest to give the _following wording_ to the decree:Decree concerning the restriction of legal rights for Jews and theirinadmissibility to take an oath.                                        dated....................1942The Ministerial Council for the Defense of the Reich orders thefollowing to be enforced as a law:                               Article 1Jews are not entitled to lodge a plea for appeal, revision, andcomplaint (nullity plea and appeal under the still valid parts ofAustrian law) against the decisions of the courts.Jews cannot apply for a judicial decision against penal measuresinflicted by the police.                               Article 2Jews cannot make use of the legal rights provided against decisionsmade by the administrative authorities.                               Article 3Insofar as legal right has already been exercised or an application forlegal decision has been requested when this law comes into effect, theyare considered to be withdrawn.                               Article 4Jews are not entitled to take an oath.                               Article 5The regulation concerning perjury and false oath applies to untruestatements of Jews not made under oath, if a person entitled to takean oath could have been sworn to this statement. In the same mannerthe regulations concerning the making of a false declaration in lieuof oath are to be applied to the untrue declaration of a Jew, if thedeclaration was the substitute for a declaration in lieu of oath or astatement with reference to such a declaration.                               Article 6The regulations do not apply to Jews who are citizens of a foreignnation.                               Article 7The supreme authorities of the Reich are authorized to issueregulations for the execution within their jurisdiction.                                   [Typed] signed: DR.

RM 11405 BReference: Your letter of 13 August 1942--III a _2_ 1706.42--.The limitation for legal appeal for Jews proposed by you extends inthe sphere of court decisions only to the legal appeal in a limitedsense--that is to say to appeal, revision, and complaint. Thisregulation does not represent a comprehensive solution of the problem,since the Jews will still be given the possibility of making use oflegal aids [Rechtsbehelfen] in a wider sense.The considerations which are decisive for your draft also apply toalmost all cases of legal aids. In criminal cases this applies aboveall to objections against penal rulings and to pleas for resumptionof proceedings. In the sphere of civil law it would apply, e.g., toreminders of cost and execution matters, objections to execution ordersand judgments by default, as well as to nullity and restitutions suits.Also, a limitation of the admissibility of suits protesting againstexecutions and suits filed by a third party will have to be taken intoconsideration, as in these cases, too, the result will be a legal aidagainst a judicial decision. I think it necessary to include all thosecases too into the regulation.I further request you to include into the draft a regulation declaringinadmissible the declining of a judge by a Jew.I have no objections against the provisions of the draft relative tothe disqualification of Jews to take an oath.

Previous evacuations of Jews have been restricted to Jews who werenot married to non-Jews. In consequence, the numbers of Jews who haveremained in the interior is quite considerable. As the ordinancewould also include these Jews as well, the measures it plans are notobjectless.2. The provision of article 7 of the ordinance according to which atthe death of a Jew his fortune escheats in its entirety to the Reichresults in the accumulation of considerably less work for the StatePolice. At the present time the procedure used by the State Police inhandling the confiscation of such Jewish inheritances must frequentlybe modified to suit each special case. If the decree were decided onthese separate procedures would no longer need to be carried out. Theordinance would therefore bring about an effective reduction in presentadministrative activity.3. The provision according to which the application of criminal lawagainst Jews is transferred from the judicial authorities to thepolice, is based on an agreement between the Reich Leader SS andthe Reich Minister of Justice Dr. Thierack. This agreement has beenapproved by the Fuehrer. For if it is to be put into practice it mustbe embodied in the form of a law, as the present competence of justice,which is based on criminal procedure, can only be modified by a legalprovision.If the ordinance which is planned does not come into force, thisprovision as it is planned must then be set down in an independent lawwhich, however, is undesirable.I beg you to consider the above-mentioned views and to examine whetherin spite of them an immediate passing of the ordinance does not seemindicated.                                                 Heil Hitler!                                                  Yours obediently,                                    [Typed] signed: DR. KALTENBRUNNER344547       11.

As Under Secretary Stuckartinformed me, the Reich Minister of the Interior himself has hisdoubts as to whether the ordinance is still necessary. When Stuckartapproached the Party Chancellery on the question, Reichsleiter Bormannsuggested that he should obtain the opinion of the Reich Minister andChief of the Reich Chancellery.On 5 April I discussed the affair with Under Secretary Klopfer. Thelatter is of the same opinion as myself, that with the exceptionperhaps of articles 6 and 7 of the draft, the ordinance can bedispensed with. As regards article 7 of the draft, Under SecretaryKlopfer took my point of view that the possibility must be consideredof directing the heritage of deceased Jews either in part or in itstotality to their non-Jewish relatives.The Reich Minister, to whom I reported on 6 April, is of the opinionthat we should decline as far as possible from a settlement of thematter by an ordinance.In order to help on the affair I came to an agreement with UnderSecretary Klopfer and suggested to Under Secretary Stuckart that thequestion of the further consideration of the draft should be raised ata discussion in which, in addition to myself and him, Under SecretaryKlopfer and Under Secretary Rothenberger and the Chief of the SecurityPolice Kaltenbrunner should take part. Under Secretary Stuckartagreed to this and suggested that the conference should take place onWednesday, 14 April, 11 oclock.2. RKabR. Dr. Ficker with the request for his consideration.3.

NOTE--The Under Secretary conference, suggested by us,about the draft on a _decree concerning the limitation of the legalright of Jews_, which was at that time completed in the ReichMinistry of the Interior took place today at the office of UnderSecretary Stuckart. Under Secretary Rothenberger, Under SecretaryKlopfer, SS Gruppenfuehrer Kaltenbrunner, and I were present as well asUnder Secretary Stuckart.The discussion showed that only articles 6 and 7 of the provisions ofthe draft of the order are considered necessary in which connectionarticle 7 is to be supplemented by a regulation which makes possible,in the case of a confiscation of property, a settlement in favor ofnon-Jewish heirs and legal dependents.It was furthermore considered suitable to have the regulation issued asa supplementary ordinance to the Reich citizens law.The regulation accordingly would approximately take the form as shownin appendix II.[Enclosure] Appendix II.2.

With this milk babies of German blood were fed in a nursinghome for children. The accused will be charged with deception [Betrug].The buyers of the milk have suffered damage, for mothers milk from aJewess cannot be regarded as food for German children. The impudentbehavior of the accused is an insult as well. Relevant charges,however, have not been applied for, so that the parents, who areunaware of the true facts, need not subsequently be worried.I shall discuss with the Reich health leader the racial hygienic aspectof the case.Berlin,..............April 1943(Referent: Ministerialrat Dr. Malzan)To the Under Secretary                                    [Initial] R [Rothenberger]                                    [Initial] V [Vollmer] 19 April    TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT NG-351    PROSECUTION EXHIBIT 132SECRET JUDGMENT OF FIRST SENATE OF PEOPLES COURT CONCERNING TWO POLES,21 MAY 1943, AND DIRECTIVE OF MINISTRY OF JUSTICE TO DEFENDANT LAUTZCONCERNING THE MANNER OF CARRYING OUT THE EXECUTION OF ONE OF THEDEFENDANTS    9 J 190/420                                         Copy    1 H 110/43                                SECRET!                   In the Name of the German PeopleIn the case against--1. the porter Paul Stefanowicz, from Berlin, born 5 January 1922 inOlyka (District of Rovno),2. the laborer Franz Lenczewski, from Berlin, born 1 August 1924 inSandec (Government General), Poland, at present in custody pendingtrial for treasonable intent, et cetera, the Peoples Court, FirstSenate, on the basis of the session of 21 May 1943, in which thefollowing participated as judges:    Peoples Court Senior Judge Laemmle, President    District Court President Dr. Schlemann,    SA Gruppenfuehrer Haas,    SA Brigadefuehrer Hohm,    SA Gruppenfuehrer Koeglmaier,as representative of the Chief Reich Prosecutor [the defendant Lautz]:Local Court Judge Dr. Pilz,found:As Poles, the defendants harmed the interests of the Reich by leavingtheir places of work in Berlin in August 1942 and going to the Reichborder, with the intention of remaining in Switzerland until the end ofthe war.The defendant _Stefanowicz_ is therefore condemned to death.The defendant _Lenczewski_, since he acted under the influence ofStefanowicz, who is mentally greatly superior to him, will receive asentence of 8 years in a penal camp, and the period of custody forinvestigation will be included in this term.                              _Findings_Both defendants are ethnic Poles, were formerly Polish citizens, and on1 September 1939 resided in the former Republic of Poland.Both defendants reported for work and were assigned to work in Berlin;Lenczewski in April 1941 in a chocolate factory, Stefanowicz in January1942 at the Neukoelln hospital.Of the two defendants, Stefanowicz makes a much more intelligent andbold impression. He belongs to the Polish intelligentsia, which is thestronghold of the Polish spirit of resistance. Consequently in March1942 shortly after he began his work, he left his place of work andattempted to flee to Denmark. He was arrested in Flensburg, however,and after 2 months in a labor reformatory camp he was returned tohis place of work in Berlin. There he was noted for his anti-Germanattitude. According to his own statement, the nurses threatened thathis attitude would bring him into the concentration camp one of thesedays. It was Stefanowicz who persuaded the codefendant Lenczewski, whois nearly 2 years younger and was at the time the deed was committedbarely 18 years old, to leave his place of work and escape with him toSwitzerland in order to live a more comfortable life there. They agreedto escape on 2 August 1942.On that day they left Berlin and went via Augsburg and Innsbruck toLandeck/Tyrol. From there they went on foot toward the Swiss border,with the intention of crossing the border secretly. In the mountains,however, they suffered from bad weather, and on 6 August 1942 they werearrested by a customs patrol in See (Tyrol), very close to the Reichborder.The prosecution assumes that the defendants had the intention ofjoining the Polish Legion. Both defendants, however, have denied thisfrom the beginning and maintain that they merely wanted to get betterworking conditions in Switzerland. The assumption of the prosecution isdoubtless supported by the fact that members of the former Polish Statewho wanted to join the legion have frequently been arrested at theborder under similar circumstances. On the other hand, no evidence hasbeen presented that the defendants were in contact with such circles.As for their personality, neither of them gives an impression of afighter but rather an effeminate one, and the fact that they merelywanted to go to Switzerland in order to live a better life there, couldnot be disproved.Nevertheless, as Poles, both of them have harmed the interests of theGerman Reich by their conduct. For they were assigned to work in theReich, and in total warfare any loss in this regard harms the interestsof the Reich. They were aware of this fact, especially since theyintended to remain in Switzerland permanently and thus to deprive theReich of their work for the entire duration of the war (crime underart. 1, par. 3 of the Regulation on Administration of the Penal Lawagainst Poles and Jews in the Incorporated Eastern Territories of 4December 1941 (Reichsgesetzblatt 1, p. 759)).The law provides the death penalty for this offense, as a rule. Onlyin less severe cases can a prison sentence be imposed. The case of thedefendant Stefanowicz is not a less severe case. As already emphasized,he belongs to the Polish intelligentsia, which is the stronghold ofthe spirit of resistance. From the very beginning he failed to adapthimself to the order prevailing in the Reich and once before made anunsuccessful attempt to escape to Denmark. He is also responsible forthe fate of his codefendant Lenczewski, to whom he is mentally farsuperior. He was therefore given the death sentence. On the otherhand, in the case of the defendant Lenczewski, who did not make a veryindependent impression during the trial, who was very young at thetime the deed was committed, and who succumbed to the influence of hismentally superior friend, a sentence of 8 years in a penal camp wasconsidered sufficient. The period of custody for investigation wasincluded in this term.Under the law, the defendants have to bear the costs of the trial,since they have been convicted.

Wdowen tried by force to preventKaminskas arrest.They are therefore sentenced to death; Kaminska under articles II, III,and XIV of the Penal Ordinance for Poles; Wdowen is sentenced as apublic enemy.                              _Findings_The defendant Kaminska, who belongs to the Polish ethnic group and whoon 1 September 1939 was residing in the territory of the former PolishState, attended elementary school and after having finished schoolworked as a laborer on several farms in Poland. She was married in 1929and since then had three children. Her husband was killed in actionduring the Polish campaign in October 1939. At the middle of December1939 she came to Germany being committed to work there. She was firstemployed for over a year by a farmer in Weidenheim, then for a yearby the farmer Landshuter at Unternzenn, and since 15 March 1942 shehas been employed by the farmer Gundel at Uffenheim. Leo Gundel is 60years old and fragile; his daughter manages the farm. At Weidenheimthe defendant Kaminska met the codefendant Wdowen who belongs to theUkrainian ethnic group. Wdowen never attended school, he can neitherread nor write, nor had he learned a trade. Until he came to Germanyin March 1940 for labor commitment he worked as a farm laborer for hisparents and for other farmers in the territory of the former Polishstate. In Germany he was first employed by a farmer in Weidenheim, andin March 1942 he was transferred to Gundel together with Kaminska.Wdowen started a love affair with the defendant Kaminska in Weidenheim.The child born in June 1942 is a result of that relationship. Thedefendant took the child to her mother in Wussiowa in March 1943.On 1 July 1942 the two defendants entered Gundels home and demandedmoney from the daughter, Marie, for the journey which the defendantKaminska had made to Poland to take her child to her mother. When thedaughter refused the request, they turned to old Gundel who was alsopresent in the room. When he, too, refused to pay any money to Kaminskaboth defendants became more and more insistent; the defendant Wdoweneven gave the farmer a push. In his distress, Gundel called for thehelp of the army private Anton Wanner, who used to work on the farm asa laborer and who happened to be spending his leave there. Wanner wasin uniform. He came into the living room and told the defendants toleave immediately. The defendant Kaminska at once attacked the soldier,slapping his face once. Thereupon, Wanner slapped her face. Now a fightresulted during which his infantry assault badge fell to the ground.Wanner, feeling himself threatened, drew his bayonet and yelled atWdowen, Get out, you bully. The defendant Kaminska by this time ranout of the room and took a hoe which was leaning near the staircase.She did not get a chance of attacking him as the soldier quickly closedthe door.Shortly afterward Wanner was riding on his bicycle along the roadto Uffenheim to go to the police station. When he was passing thetwo defendants who were walking in the same direction, the defendantKaminska threw a stone weighing half a pound after the soldier without,however, hitting him.The next day police sergeant Dirmann went to Gundels farm, but thedefendant Kaminska was working in the fields. There, the policeofficial told her to follow him. The defendant Kaminska followed himunwillingly and hesitatingly. The codefendant Wdowen ran after thepolice official, although the latter had forbidden him to follow them.On the way Dirmann twice slapped Wdowens face to force him to turnback. Despite this he followed the two to the prison cell. When Dirmannwanted to put Kaminska in the cell she began screaming. Wdowen rushedup to them and embraced Kaminska with both hands so that the policeofficial was prevented from arresting Kaminska. Only after severalother people who were called in by the police official came to his aid,he succeeded in overpowering the two defendants and putting Kaminska inthe cell.The defendant Kaminska states that she learned before 1 July 1942 atthe employment office that the farmer Gundel had to pay her travelexpenses both ways. On 1 July 1942, she made only these demands.Besides, she only slapped the soldier after he had slapped her face.She had not purposely torn off his infantry assault medal. It wastrue she had fetched the hoe but she had not raised it to assault thesoldier but only to intimidate him.The defendant further admits having picked up a stone on the way toUffenheim and having thrown it after the soldier; she merely mentionedas an excuse that she had been so angry that she had picked up a stoneand thrown it at Wanner.Regarding her arrest by police sergeant Dirmann, the defendant saysshe had offered resistance because she had been afraid that the policeofficial would throw her into a cellar; she had not known before whatthe official really wanted from her.The defendant Wdowen denies having struck or attacked the old manGundel and the soldier in the living room. He had only received a blowon the nose from Wanner when Wanner had said something to him and toKaminska which he could not understand. He had not seized or held him.Concerning the arrest of Kaminska, Wdowen states that he had alreadythought that Kaminska was to be arrested by the police official; hehad also kept running after them, although he had been forbidden todo so, and he did not let himself be intimidated by the slappings.Outside the cell he had intended to tear Kaminska away from thepolice official because he had felt sorry for her. The excuses whichthe defendants have put forward are irrelevant; for the rest, theafore-mentioned facts have been confirmed by the witnesses Gundel andWurm. The soldier Wanner has been reported missing since the fightingin Tunisia. The witness, police sergeant Wurm testified, however, thatWanner had made definite and clear statements. The court is thereforeconvinced that the defendant Kaminska hit the soldier first; she wasnot authorized to do so in any way. When the witness Miss Gundelhad told her that she would first make inquiries at the employmentoffice as to whether the demands for payment of travel expenseswere justified, the defendant Kaminska should have been satisfied.If despite that she continued to insist on her imagined demand andtogether with Wdowen behaved insolently towards Miss Gundel and herfather, it was absolutely understandable that old Gundel called thesoldier Wanner for help. The defendant Kaminska should have compliedimmediately with Wanners demand to leave the room. She cannot claimthat she did not understand his demand. If instead of immediatelyleaving the farmers living room, she slapped the soldiers face thenthis constituted a bodily maltreatment and thereby an assault andbattery.As the codefendant Wdowen, too, according to the credible statementswhich the soldier Wanner had made to the police sergeant Wurm, eithergripped the soldier or at any rate took sides with Kaminska, so thatWanner had to fear a joint attack, it was understandable that he drewhis bayonet in his defense. If the defendant Kaminska had to run out ofthe house to get a hoe and with it had walked towards the front doorwhere the soldier was standing, Wanner had to fear the possibility ofan attack on his life, although it was not established at the trialwhether the defendant had already lifted the hoe to hit him. Thisbehavior must be regarded as a threat within the meaning of article 241of the Criminal (Penal) Code.The defendant admits that after the incident in Gundels room, sometime later on the way to Uffenheim she, in her anger, picked up astone weighing a half pound and threw it after the soldier Wanner whowas sitting on a bicycle, however, without hitting him.The facts thus established prove that the defendant has committed acrime within the meaning of article 1, paragraph 1 of the Law againstViolent Criminals of 5 December 1939. For this the death sentence isimposed on a person who, among other things, when committing a seriousact of violence uses cutting or thrusting weapons or with such a weaponthreatens the body or life of another person.An act of violence within the meaning of that provision is constitutedby a violent attack on a person which, according to design or executionor in view of the consequences for the person who is being attacked,endangers the security afforded by law to a high degree, and whichtherefore is particularly rejected and detested by the nationalcommunity which is engaged in a fight for its right of existence,according to the verdict of the Reich Supreme Court of 26 January 1942,Second Criminal Senate, January 1942.In the present case, the basic punishable deed is a threat within themeaning of article 241 of the Criminal (Penal) Code.The defendant by throwing, in her anger, such a heavy stone afterthe soldier did not merely make a purposeless gesture. The courtis convinced that it is evident from the over-all attitude of thedefendant Kaminska, which she had previously displayed toward thesoldier, that she meant to hit Wanner. A stone weighing half a poundwhen being thrown by someone in a condition which the defendant herselfdescribed as anger may kill a human being. Thus, a stone of that weightmust be considered equal to a cutting or thrusting weapon; it must beconsidered as an object equal to a weapon within the meaning of thelaw against violent criminals. The defendant dared attack a Germansoldier, she took up an offensive position which would have causedgrave injury if the soldier had not evaded the stone which was thrownat him. The defendant was about to endanger gravely the life and healthof a German national. The German nation which is engaged in a grimdefensive struggle rightly expects the most severe methods to be takenagainst such alien elements. The crime of the defendant, by design, andexecution, as well as a considerable violation of the security affordedby law, constitutes a serious crime of violence within the meaning ofthe law against violent criminals. The fact that the criminal is a Poleis of particular significance.From the name of the law it is concluded that it can only be appliedagainst persons who are to be regarded as violent criminals. Thedefendant had not been provoked to the violent action. After she hadfailed to hit him with the hoe, she tried to hit the soldier on theroad. The over-all behavior of the Polish woman, also toward thefarmer, proves that the crime is not alien to her nature. She therebycharacterizes herself as a Polish violent criminal. The defendantcannot dispute that she resisted with all her strength when a policeofficial wanted to put her in a cell. Her excuse that she had notknown what the official wanted from her cannot be believed. She knewin what manner she had acted toward the Germans on the previous day.She therefore had to expect the police official who moreover was inuniform to try and arrest her. The court has no doubt that she, as wellas Wdowen who admitted having assumed that Kaminska was to be pickedup because of her behavior on the day before, knew that she would nowbe arrested. By her violent resistance outside the cell, she thereforeviolated article 113 of the Criminal (Penal) Code.According to the opinion of the medical expert, which the Courtshares, the defendant shows no symptoms which could justify doubts asto her responsibility for the crime.As the defendant on 1 September 1939 was a resident in the territory ofthe former Polish State, she had to be found guilty in application ofarticles II, III, and XIV of the Penal Ordinance for Poles, of a crimeof assault and battery in conjunction with a crime of threat, a crimeunder article 1, paragraph 1 of the Law against Violent Criminals, andof a crime of offering resistance to the police.The defendant was further charged with intentionally having torn offthe infantry assault badge of the soldier Wanner. That could not beproved during the trial. The witness, Miss Gundel, testifies that afterthe defendant Kaminska had slapped the soldiers face, a fight ensuedand that afterward the soldiers infantry assault medal was missing.In view of this evidence there is, at any rate, a possibility that thebadge might have loosened in the course of the fight. A particularacquittal was not necessary, however, as the attitude of the defendantsmust be regarded as one action.Although the old feeble farmer Gundel was not physically injured bythe thrust of the defendant Wdowen, he did rightly feel the action ofthe Ukrainian to be an offense to his honor as a German. The defendantWdowen, by holding Kaminska with both hands when the Polish woman wasabout to be put into a cell so that the police official was unable todo so for the moment, and by allowing himself to be removed only afterthe intervention of other persons, offered forceful resistance to anofficial who was lawfully doing his duty.By his action, he also tried to free the codefendant Kaminska from thehold of the official in whose custody she was.His act, therefore, constitutes an attempt to free a prisoner inconjunction with resistance to the police under articles 120, 43, 113,73 of the Penal Code.That, however, does not exhaust the entire unlawful character of hisdeed.The defendant Wdowen knows very well that the German economy, onaccount of wartime conditions, is dependent on foreign labor, inparticular on labor from the eastern territories. He speculated thathis offenses would be overlooked in order not to lose him as a worker.The defendant also knew that because of the drafts into the armedforces the security organs in the Reich have been reduced and thatGermany is deprived of the population fit for military service sothat the rural population is largely helpless against the insolentand obstinate behavior and against attacks, which occur more and moreon the part of such elements from the East. The defendant Wdowen,therefore, committed the offense taking advantage of the extraordinarywartime conditions. His action is therefore particularly despicable anddemands that the ordinary limit of punishment be exceeded.The defendant therefore had to be sentenced for a crime under article4 of the Decree against Public Enemies in conjunction with resistancetoward the police and an attempt to free a prisoner.Under article III, paragraph 2 of the Penal Ordinance for Poles, thedeath sentence must be passed if the law provides for it. The defendantKaminska, therefore, under the law against violent criminals isdeserving of the death penalty.The death penalty has to be pronounced as the only just atonementbecause the security afforded by law within the German living spacemust be protected against Polish criminality with the utmost severity.The defendant Wdowen, if only by his behavior toward the feebleold farmer Gundel proved that he is an insolent aggressive fellowinasmuch as he kept following the police official, although he hadbeen chastized twice. It is to be concluded that he was waiting fora favorable moment to free the codefendant Kaminska by force, andfinally by attempting to prevent by force the police official fromthe execution of his official duties and the latter having to callfor assistance, he topped his provocative, dangerous behavior. Everysecurity organ enjoys the special protection of the Reich. He whoimpedes in such a provocative manner the security organs, which arestationed at home, and which on account of their numerical minorityare particularly overburdened during the war, must expect the Reich toreact with utmost severity. That applies, in particular, to the foreignworkers from the East who work in the Reich. In view of that, the courthas assumed a particularly grave case within the meaning of paragraph 4of the Decree against Public Enemies, and has not attached any decisiveimportance to the circumstances alone that the defendant Wdowen has hadno previous convictions and has hitherto not attracted any unfavorableattention during his stay in Germany. Therefore, the defendant Wdowenhad to be sentenced to death under the penal law of article 4 of theDecree against Public Enemies.Costs: Paragraph 465, Code of Criminal Procedure.

VII                               _SECRET_To the Supreme Reich AuthoritiesSubject: Posted prohibitions concerning Poles, Jews, and gypsiesThe separately published decrees and rules governing the livelihood ofPoles, Jews, and gypsies within the jurisdiction of the Reich, havefrequently led to a summary equalization of these groups in the publiceye as far as sale-and-utilization prohibitions, public announcementsin the press, etc., are concerned. This attitude does not correspondwith the differentiated political position to be granted to thesegroups now, and in the future.As far as Jews and gypsies are concerned the accomplished evacuationand isolation of these groups by the Chief of the Security Police andthe SD has made the publication of special directives (concerning theall inclusive prohibition of participation in many livelihoods) in theprevious manner meaningless. Therefore, corresponding public directivesmay be eliminated.The decrees and regulations which have been decided upon to governthe livelihood of the Poles will remain as before. For politicalpractical reasons it is hereby recommended to maintain a certain amountof restraint in the public directives of these regulations, be it inposters, signboards, on press releases, etc.I wish that the subordinate officers be informed of the necessarydirectives.

These Jews were at some timeeither evacuated to the East or were sent to Theresienstadt. Althoughmy local office drew the attention of the District Court Vienna severaltimes to the fact that such requests, as well as applications for theadmission of such Jews as witnesses before courts or for hereditarybiological examinations cannot be granted on account of reasonsstated by the Security Police, the District Court Vienna renews itsapplications continuously.Besides the fact that the Jews for years had time and opportunity toclarify their position with regard to descent, the proceedings forthe checking of the descent demanded by the Jews or their familiesare according to experience in general made only in order to concealtheir descent so that they would not be subject to the measures of theSecurity Police intended for them, or to those which have already beencarried out. For this reason and in the interest of urgent dispatch ofwork important to the war effort the granting of applications of thiskind has to be refused for the time being.Therefore, I request to direct the District Court Vienna not to submitany such applications in future. I would be grateful to be informedabout the steps taken from there.

To the President of the Court of Appeal, _Vienna_Subject: Handling of cases concerning descent of Jews or Jewish           persons of mixed raceNo previous correspondence.The Chief of the Security Police and the Security Service pointed outthat in cases concerning descent of Jews and Jewish persons of mixedrace the office of the police are frequently asked for information onthe place of abode of deported Jews by the courts especially by theDistrict Court Vienna, or that their admission, as witnesses or for thepurpose of examination for hereditary biological expert opinions isrequested. These requests cannot be granted for reasons of the SecurityPolice.Even if the hearing (_and examination_)[381] of the Jews (_bean important piece of evidence for the clarifying of the question ofdescent_) in many cases help to frustrate the intentions (_of theJews_) to conceal their descent, reasons of the security policedemand to desist therefrom (_from this piece of evidence_).In the near future I intend to issue in a decree detailed regulationsfor the handling of cases concerning the descent of Jews and Jewishpersons of mixed race. Already now I request to inform the DistrictCourt Vienna (_and other courts, in your district, which accordingto your judgment, Mr. President of the Appellate Court, should beinformed_) of the following:                             (insert)[382]                                                       As deputy:2.

If a state deemsit necessary to defend itself against being inundated and does sowithin the frame of a social problem, then it can and must be done byapplying normal, decent means.During the Goebbels campaign in 1938 I was abroad. When I heardabout those events I said to my family: We must be ashamed of beingGermans. That was my view at that time and that is my view today. Theonly person with whom I am united in faithful friendship until todaybecause we went to school together is a full Jew. I succeeded in savinghis life all through that era. He again holds his former office as ajudge. My physician too is half-Jewish. That attitude of mine naturallymeant that on many occasions I was faced with inner conflicts. I askyou to consider that the Jewish problem was regarded as the centralproblem of the National Socialist State and the entire life in Germanywas to be placed in line with that. Concerning that question Hitlerand his followers worked in an entirely uncompromising manner; that anexpert administrator could not bypass that basic attitude is a matterof fact. I shall have an opportunity to demonstrate what my personalattitude was toward those questions and how it always evidenced itselfin an effort to put a check on the wishes of party policy, to makeimprovements and to exercise as far as possible a moderating influenceon the practical application of those matters.Q. What were the manifestations of your attitude to the Jewish questionin your office?A. The prosecution charges me with having cooperated in taking measuresagainst the Jews. That the ordinance of 4 December 1941[384] againstJews in the eastern territories must be evaluated under particularpoints of view, I shall show in connection with the Polish question.For the rest, I ask you to consider that in view of the strength ofthe powers with which I was engaged in a struggle, a hundred percentvictory of the Ministry of Justice was entirely out of the question.In that sphere, too, faithful to my basic attitude, I did work tomake justice prevail; but frequently I had to content myself withmaking a compromise and I had to be pleased when at least I hadachieved some amelioration. To use a customary phrase, if I had drawnthe consequences from every defeat, I would have deprived myself ofall possibility to aid the Jews. Quite apart from the fact that theresignation from office, before the war would have been a factualimpossibility, and during the war a legal impossibility until a newminister was appointed.With the permission of the Tribunal I will prove how difficult it wasby citing an example. When the Party started a campaign against Jewishlawyers, I went to see Hitler and told him that it was untenableto remove from their profession Jewish lawyers among whom researchpeople of repute were included, and with whom I myself had worked.I was pleased when I succeeded in persuading Hitler that that wascorrect and in achieving his agreement that he would reject the wishesof the Party. To inform the agencies concerned, I called a meetingof Ministers of Justice of the Laender who were still in office inthose days and informed them about Hitlers decision. The result wassurprising. I encountered bitter resistance, and the meeting bore noresult. Hitler asked for Guertner to come to see him and asked him forinformation as to whether I was not perhaps a Jew myself. Then theParty began to exercise pressure on Hitler. He abandoned his decision,and the Jewish lawyers were removed from office. So as to make itpossible at least for the Jews to preserve their rights, I proposed toset up the institute of the so-called Jewish consultants where formerlawyers worked as consultants.As to my own attitude toward these problems, that I could show properlyonly where I, myself, had to make the decisions. In this connection,I attach importance to the fact in saying here that nothing is moreremoved from me than here to play the part of the friend of the Jews. Iam not a friend of the Jews; I am not a friend of the Aryans as such;but I am a friend of justice. And anybody who saw me at work and wishesto give a just opinion can confirm that with regard to all those who inmy opinion were unjustly persecuted; no matter what their race or whattheir class, I tried to help them with all my strength.Roosevelt, the former President of the United States of America, in1944, in an address to the United Nations said, Hitler asserts thathe had committed the crimes against the Jews in the name of the Germanpeople. May every German show that his own heart is free of suchcrimes by protecting the persecuted with all his might. I can claimfor myself that I acted accordingly. Concerning the members of theMinistry who were not fully Aryan, I kept them in office; and as hasbeen established at this trial concerning judges who were not fullyAryan, I left large numbers of them in their offices irrespective ofthe Party purge. I looked after those who had been dismissed from theirposts, and who were non-Aryans, and who had Jewish relatives. As far aspossible, I protected them against being driven out of their homes andbeing deported.Q. Concerning the question of civil servants remaining under Dr.Schlegelberger who were not fully Aryan, persons who were onlydismissed on the basis of Thieracks list, I refer to Exhibit 42.[385]On the legal provisions concerning the fact that since 1933 a ministercould not resign on his own, I will submit Schlegelberger Documents 79and 80.[386]Witness, you also dealt with a bill concerning people of half Jewishrace. The prosecution has included those documents under PS-4055,Prosecution Exhibit 401.[387] Will you tell us something about thosedocuments?A. That document has been the subject of the discussion before theInternational Military Tribunal. The document, if my recollection isright, consists of two parts. On 12 March [1942], there was a letterfrom me to Reich Minister Lammers, and a letter of 5 April, to variousagencies.Q. May I interrupt you for a moment? The first letter is dated 6 March,and is in the English text on page 95.A. I thought you were talking of the discussion which took place on 6March.Q. Yes, on page 95.A. First of all, Id like to speak about the letter of 12 March. Thatwas, as I said, a letter from me to Reich Minister Lammers. From thatletter I gathered that on 6 March there was a discussion about thetreatment of persons of mixed origins, partly Jewish, partly Aryan. Inthat conference, the SS had demanded that people of mixed origin wereto be treated in the same way as full Jews and were to be sent to laborcamps in Poland.[388] If that had been done, a demand which for a longtime had been voiced by the Party in a categorical manner would havebeen carried out. If one reflects to what extent the police measureswere carried out in those days against Jews, one had to recognize thatnow the question of the fate of the mixed Jews had entered into anacute phase.When I heard about the subject of that discussion, the question aroseimmediately whether one could, and how one could, intervene. My moralobligation was clear to me. There was the difficulty that it was adifferent department; that in itself was difficult to interfere witha different department in its work; and again and again there wouldbe the additional difficulty that I was no minister. But to put itplainly, it was the case of an under secretary who was only appointed[as acting Reich Minister of Justice] under a system by which he couldbe given notice any day. If I had attempted to attack that politicalsolution with legal or ethical weapons, nothing would have been doneand there would have been nothing but mockery about me. Thus, I had tofind a different way.I had to try to approach somebody who perhaps might have thepossibility to talk some sense into Hitler, and that person was ReichMinister Lammers, a man from the group of old civil servants, a manwho had a feeling for right and justice, and whom I had frequentlyassisted in difficult situations. I could be quite open and frankwith him; and, therefore, the quite open way in which I talked inmy letter was without any pretense. I described the suggestions asentirely impossible. I did so knowing that thereby I was interferingwith affairs which had nothing to do with me as far as my departmentwas concerned, for the judiciary only had an outside interest in thoseaffairs. There was a question of compulsory divorce, a question whichnaturally I answered in the negative; a question which was naturallyvery important for those whom it concerned, but the importance of whichwas not comparable to the great problem which was now my concern.Lammers said I could talk to him, but that conversation never cameoff, and probably it did not come off because Lammers was away at the[Fuehrer] Headquarters. Thus, I had to act on my own initiative, and,as I have said, I could not act in basing myself on legal and ethicalconsiderations because that would have amounted to doing nothing. Ihad to limit myself concerning the agencies in question to acquaintthem with the fact that the solution which they intended to applywas not possible. The entire idea and the entire way of thinkingconcerning that question altogether was based upon the desire to seeto it that a further increase of persons of mixed origin, Aryan andJewish descent, was to be avoided. I used that as my basis, and this iswhat my proposal amounted to. Certain groups were to be exempted fromthe solution altogether from the very outset. First, persons of mixeddescent of the second degree, that is to say those persons who hadonly one Jewish grandparent; second, a person of mixed descent of thefirst degree, that is to say a person who had two Jewish grandparents;of those the people who were not able to propagate; and three, thosepersons of mixed descent, first degree, whose offspring under thelaw were not considered half-Jews. By that proposal, therefore, allpersons of mixed descent, second degree a very large number, and aconsiderable number of people of mixed descent first degree, wouldhave been excluded from this measure. The remaining persons were ofmixed descent, first degree. For them I suggested that if they wereto prefer it, they were to be sterilized rather than deported toPoland. May I draw the attention to this point. The idea of escapingdeportation by voluntary sterilization did not originate within myself.That idea originated from the persons of mixed descent themselves.I knew that persons of mixed descent had asked physicians to exemptthem from the application of the Nuernberg laws and had themselvessuggested to afford them the possibility of sterilization. In view ofthat situation in which they found themselves, I thought it justifiedto revert to the suggestion which these people themselves had madeoriginally, and to afford them an opportunity in that manner to escapedeportation to Poland. The prosecution employed that suggestion of mineto raise charges against me. I believe that if one thinks things outuntil the last, it is not so difficult to recognize that these chargesare unfounded. My suggestion, altogether my work in that respect as Ihave said before, was not one of the tasks of the judiciary. If I wentbeyond the limits of my department, one must bear in mind that thecharge would only be justified if one took it for granted that I was amodel of active National Socialists, an active National Socialist whoovercomes every obstacle even the limitations of his department, and Iwould assume that everything that has been discussed here so far willshow that to assume such an active National Socialist ardor would becomplete nonsense. I acted in accordance with my ethical feelings; theonly motive for me was the intention to check a development which wasfatal for a large number of persons. There are, after all, situationswhere one can only escape a larger evil by applying a smaller evil.But that somebody who all his life has thought along the lines of law,found it extremely difficult to make a decision of that kind, that theTribunal will understand.Q. Under Document NG-151,[389] the prosecution has submitted documentsconcerning limitations of the legal means for Jews in penal cases.Please give us an explanation concerning those documents.A. Those documents begin with a letter by Freisler dated, I believe,3 August 1942. In that letter Freisler tells the agencies in questionabout a bill concerning the problem we have just mentioned. The reasonfor his suggestion, he referred to as the exigencies of the war, hesays that the state of affairs is untenable, and that it weakens thedefensive will of the German people. Freisler wrote that letter withoutmy knowing anything about it beforehand, but afterward he told meabout it and gave me his explanation. This is what he told me: Himmlerand his agencies had pointed out again and again that the presentstate of affairs was an impossibility; only a radical separation ofthe entire Jewish problem from the judiciary and transfer to policewas conceivable. Again here we find--I shall have to revert to thatlater--Himmler had also said that the administrative measures againstthe Jews had advanced so far that it would be nonsense, in particularconcerning criminal Jews, to be more lenient; therefore, one had toguard against allowing these criminal Jews, who were already under thesupervision of the judiciary, such benefits as legal protection.Himmlers desire to transfer Jewish affairs to the police was toomuch even for Freisler. Perhaps he was also particularly proud of hispaternity of the penal ordinance concerning Poles and Jews which heconsidered his own sphere. Therefore, so he told me--and I believedhim--in all circumstances he wanted to adhere to the competence of thecourts; but he then convinced himself that somehow or other he had tomake a concession because otherwise events would move without us.Furthermore, we of the administration of justice, particularly inthe Incorporated Eastern Territories, suffered from a severe lack ofjudges, and we could only master that difficulty if we exempted anumber of judges from service in the armed forces. If Freisler and wehad refused consistently to comply with Himmlers wishes, it would havebeen easy for Himmler to get Hitler to agree to cancel such exemptionsfrom service with the armed forces, and thus the administrationof justice in the eastern territories would have come to an endaltogether. In order to avoid this danger, Freisler believed that hehad found a way out in limiting legal remedies and thereby to start outon a way which we later on, inside Germany, in cases against Germans,had to take on account of the lack of judges. That is why he made thesuggestion. I could not altogether agree with Freislers arguments, butI attached importance to the fact that this new regulation was to befinal and was to appear as such to the outside world, too. That mightstrengthen our position toward the opposing forces and, therefore, inthe letter I wrote afterward,[390] I discussed the question of whetherJews are able to take an oath, and I included that question in my draftso as to make that draft more well rounded and complete. In itself thisquestion of the oath was important, for under German law it is the dutyof the judge to attach equal weight to statements made under oath, andstatements made while the person was not under oath.There again we were faced with a case in which a concession which initself was immaterial but which to the outside world, nevertheless,seemed important, had to be made in order to pacify Party circles. Ifone wants to evaluate such a procedure, one must bear in mind that 1month later Thierack did find a final and comprehensive solution. Hedropped my suggestion and transferred the Jews to the police.[391]Q. The prosecution also submitted Document NG-589, Prosecution Exhibit372,[392] a document which concerns a curtailment of the poor lawprivileges of the Jews. Was that ruling made at your suggestion?A. No. I only heard about that ruling here when the document book wassubmitted. At every ministry certain matters which are not of muchimportance are dealt with quite independently by departments which arebelow the under secretary or the minister. It is altogether out of thequestion that an under secretary or minister deals with everythingpersonally. He would even misunderstand his function if he were to doso. Those matters, for example, the question of the poor law, fellwithin the competence of the then Assistant Under Secretary Hueber, whosigned the ordinance.As I said, I only heard about it here, but I should like to addthat the institution of the poor law was created so as to enablepoor persons to conduct civil litigations. The granting of poor lawprivileges does not mean that the person to whom it is granted canconduct proceedings free of costs, but it only exempts him from paymentin advance. He is still under an obligation to pay.[393]The poor law institution, therefore, so to speak is an institutionof government welfare. For a long time before Hueber ordered it,government financial support of Jews had been stopped, and theyhad been referred to their own Jewish welfare organizations. Theuncurtailed provisions governing the poor law, therefore, were not inaccordance with the line otherwise observed, and Hueber refers to thatwhen he considers the old ordinance as outmoded.Q. I do not know whether the witness statements were clear enough toelucidate the concept of the poor law. I hear that the expression inEnglish has been translated by poor law. That translation mightperhaps lead to confusion. We are concerned here merely with thequestion of costs and merely with the exemption of paying costs inadvance, and that is the cost of civil litigation.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *Q. I come now to the introduction of the German criminal law in theIncorporated Eastern Territories. Will you please give a short reviewof the general development of that question?A. These matters, as far as the time was concerned, are connected withwhat I said before. Among the drafts sent out in February 1940, therewas also one about the introduction of criminal law.Q. May I interrupt you? That, again, is Exhibit 459.[394]A. That draft comes from Freislers sphere, and in the absence of theReich Minister of Justice Guertner, as well as Freisler, I signed thatdraft upon the request of the Minister. That draft provided absolutelyequal treatment of Germans and Poles. Later on, 6 June 1940, a decreewas issued about the introduction of penal law in the IncorporatedEastern Territories and that decree was only designed for Poles andJews; that shows that before my time, and without any assistance on mypart a special law was created for Poles and Jews. Apparently Freislerafterward gave in to the efforts of the Party and had managed afterhard struggles to obtain the approval of Guertner, who, as I know, wasagainst such a thing on principle. But the decree of 6 June 1940 bearsthe signatures of Frick and Guertner.Q. That decree will be contained in my document, Schlegelberger60.[395] Then, it came to the penal ordinance concerning Jews andPoles, 7 December 1941, that is Exhibit 343.[396] Will you pleasediscuss that decree in detail?A. That decree of 7 December 1941 which has been the subject of adetailed discussion in this trial is based on the following: The decreeof June 1940, in the view of the department of criminal legislationin the Ministry, was not satisfactory. And that was because theextent of punishment was not sufficient, neither the maximum nor theminimum of punishment was sufficient. There was also a lack of specificprovisions. In addition to that, the Reich Chancellery had informedthe Ministry, that the deputy of the Fuehrer and the Party, demanded adiscriminatory law concerning Poles and Jews.Q. I refer to Exhibit 341.[397]A. Therefore, the Department for Penal Legislation--that was beforemy period in office as Acting Reich Minister of Justice--had startedto work out a new draft which should take care of these deficiencies.When I took over after Guertners death, Freisler reported to me aboutthat matter and told me the following: It was Himmlers intention toobtain sole competency for all cases against Poles and Jews, and thatGauleiter Greiser of Warthegau province was of the same opinion, andhe if necessary wanted to eliminate the administration of justice withthe aid of civilian courts martial. Bormann was of the same opinionand demanded, first of all, the introduction of corporal punishment.According to this information I had to expect a fight with the Party.This fight which was fought to maintain legal procedures for Polesand Jews in all events, could only be successful if I could pointout that the courts had at their disposal an appropriate procedureand appropriate provisions which were sufficient for all, even themost serious cases. The new draft,[398] in my opinion, was designedto rebut the assertion by the Party that the courts could not masterthe situation. Therefore, in April 1941, I submitted that draft tothe Ministerial Council for Reich Defense to the attention of ReichMinister Lammers, in order to achieve a decision. I also announcedto Lammers that I had to see him in advance to inform him about thesituation, and about the conditions which lead to the draft in thatform. The prosecution has repeatedly referred to that covering letterwhich accompanied the draft.[399] Therefore, I should like to explainthe reason for this letter, and the manner in which it was written.According to the legal provisions, to those provisions which I havealready discussed, I had to have the approval of the Party Chancellery,but only then did I have any chance to obtain that approval, ifthat draft was implemented with those main points which I considerednecessary.If I had described in my letter the contents and consequences of thedraft without exaggeration, I could never have expected the approvalof the Party Chancellery. Therefore, I had no alternative but toemphasize the increases in the severity of treatment with exaggeratedexpressions, to pass over less severe provisions, and to leave outreferences to decrees which would make this decree more lenient.Whether it came to any conference with Lammers, I could no longertell. I remember quite clearly the event which proved to me that myassumption was correct, that we would have to expect a most energeticattack on the part of Himmler.In the summer of 1941, Himmler asked me to come to a conference. Thatwas the only one I ever had with Himmler. There was a great pressurewith regard to time connected with that request. Himmler told me thathe was on his way to see Hitler and that he had to have my approval.Penal cases against Poles and Jews should be turned over to him, thatis to say, to the police. That was regardless of where the acts hadbeen committed.I rejected that categorically and told him that for that kind of changeof competence, there was no reason whatsoever, particularly since in avery short time a new regulation could be expected about that questionby the Ministerial Council for Reich Defense. That, of course, madeHimmler suspicious. At that time, it did not seem to him to be theright thing to fight against the Ministerial Council for Reich Defensewhich was under the presidency of Goering, at that time a strongopponent. Himmler seemed to depart for a short time from his originalplan.The Ministerial Council for Reich Defense passed that draft in Decemberof the same year and that determined and assured the competence of thecourts for penal cases against Poles and Jews[400]. When I left officethat was immediately changed as could be seen from these proceedings.That decree dates back to December 1941, as I have already pointed outthe period when my task as Acting Minister of Justice came to an end.It is not surprising that I could not gain a clear picture, as to howthat decree was applied and what the consequences were.I do recognize that one could criticize individual sentences atleast as far as the limited amount of material is concerned which isavailable to us now. However, considering that there were about half amillion penal cases during 1 year--as regrettable as it may be in theindividual case--it is not very decisive for an over-all judgment ofconditions. I owe it to the German judges to state here frankly andpublicly that as long as I could observe their activity, they havedischarged their duties with a definite desire for justice in general.Concerning the criticism which was voiced against this decree, I shouldlike to say the following in detail. The most essential feature ofthat decree was its practical application. I took every opportunitywhen a judge from the eastern territories came to see me to point outthat that decree gave a great deal of latitude to the judges; thattherefore, the judges for the procedure as well as for the sentencinghad to keep in mind that they were servants of justice. Beyond that Icaused Freisler to discuss the point of view of just application in anarticle in a magazine, _Deutsche Justiz_ (German Justice).[401]_Deutsche Justiz_, an official publication, was read by all judgesand prosecutors, and that made absolutely certain that they knew howFreisler thought about it, and that he did not want any arbitraryapplication. That achieved that Freisler himself was prevented fromgiving individual directives or expressing opinions which would gocontrary to the meaning of that decree. In view of his unstable nature,this was particularly important.This article by Freisler took into account my demands by stating thatit was a serious duty of judges and prosecutors in cases of Polesand Jews to apply the same maximum care as they would in the case ofGermans. The prosecutors are instructed in preliminary investigationsto examine also points in favor of the defendant very carefully so thatthe defendant can recognize the charges made against him and is put ina position to prepare his defense. The courts are admonished to keep inmind that it was not within the meaning of the decree that facts whichwere of little or no importance should be artificially exaggerated.What harms an individual does not harm the Reich. Sufficientopportunity should be given to the defendant to use legal remedies,to explain things, and to state his views to the evidence submitted.Everything should be avoided which in the least would make the sentencelook like a sentence based on suspicion. Under all circumstances, theextent of the punishment should be within sound measure. The legalremedy of appeal should be applied by the prosecutor, also in favor ofthe defendant and for that express purpose, the time limit was extendedto twice its normal length.PRESIDING JUDGE BRAND: Mr. Schlegelberger, you are referringto an article by Freisler, are you not?DEFENDANT SCHLEGELBERGER: Yes.PRESIDING JUDGE BRAND: Does that have an exhibit number, orwill it have?DR. KUBUSCHOK: I will submit that article as DocumentSchlegelberger 61; 61 will be the number of that article. It is in mydocument book.PRESIDING JUDGE BRAND: 161?DR. KUBUSCHOK: No, only 61 in document book 3, Schlegelbergerdocument book 3.PRESIDING JUDGE BRAND: Thank you very much.DEFENDANT SCHLEGELBERGER: The right for civil suits forPoles and Jews had already been rescinded by the old decree. A newdecree brought modification by which also Germans should not have thatright any longer as Freisler explained. And now the most importantelement--the latitude and extent of punishment was increased not onlytoward heavier punishment, but also by decreasing the minimum. Thedeath penalty was mandatory only where an act of violence was committedagainst a German on account of his being a German. That was alreadycontained in the old decree. In all other cases, apart from the deathsentence, there was an opportunity for a prison term.In the old decree, in the case of anyone owning or carrying weaponsa death penalty was mandatory. The new decree provides for thepossibility of a prison term which goes all the way down to 3 months inprison. That modification applied to a large number of offenses. Also,the mandatory death sentence for arson was abolished. Apart from that,I am of the opinion--and it has been mentioned here frequently--thatwhether the death penalty is mandatory or optional, a judge who doesnot want the sentence of death in taking into account the facts in acase, can almost always avoid that possibility.The prosecution asserts that the new decree excludes the clemency pleafor Poles and Jews. That is not correct. If it is stated that thesentence was final and had to be executed immediately that only meansthat with the exception of that right the sentence is final. I willnot discuss the question as to whether a sovereign can forego the useof the clemency plea from the outset, but it is beyond doubt that theMinisterial Council for Reich Defense could not have excluded the rightof pardon on the part of Hitler. Besides, for the Incorporated EasternTerritories, the pardon regulations of 1935 applied. Article 453 ofthe Code of Criminal Procedure, according to which execution of thedeath sentence is only possible after it has been ascertained that theauthority in charge of the clemency prerogative has refused to makeuse of this prerogative was especially emphasized upon my demands inFreislers article. In fact, Poles were pardoned. That was mentioned inthese proceedings. I would like to refer to two cases which I remember:the case Pitra and the case Wozniak.DR. KUBUSCHOK: Those cases are contained in Document NG-398,Prosecution Exhibit 253.[402]DEFENDANT SCHLEGELBERGER: The right to have defense counselis not taken from the defendant by that decree. On the basis of theregulations concerning Special Courts of that time, a defense counselhad to be appointed for the defendant. And I may say in conclusion thatthe penal ordinance concerning Poles and Jews guaranteed the Poles andJews a court procedure and a sentence by the court. Also, it preventedthese defendants from being dealt with without the protection of thecourt and being turned over to the police.Q. I am just informed that the translation on one point was in error.The witness stated that he would not discuss the question as to whetherthe right for pardon on the part of the sovereign, or the supremeauthority of the state, could be omitted, and instead of the wordsovereign, the word defendant came over the channel.According to Exhibit 346, retroactivity of the penal ordinance forPoles and Jews was ordered.[403] What can you say in that connection?MR. LAFOLLETTE: I did not get the Exhibit number.DR. KUBUSCHOK: Exhibit 346.DEFENDANT SCHLEGELBERGER: I have described how great thepressure on the part of Himmler and Bormann had been. We had justsucceeded in calming these parties down. They had had quite differentideas of the practical application, but now Freisler again piped up. Hecomplained that in past cases the old decree was still applicable. Inorder to prevent a renewed debate about the competency of the police,that request for retroactivity was granted. Besides, that decreeconcerning retroactivity had a consequence which the Party officialshad not taken into account, most probably, because now, on these manypending cases against people who had been found to have arms, not theold decree but the new decree had to be applied which also gave thepossibility of a penalty of 3 months prison term instead of the deathsentence, which was mandatory under the old decree.Q. The prosecution charges you with having introduced or contributedtoward introducing the Standgerichte--the civilian courts martial--inthe Incorporated Eastern Territories. Document NG-136, ProsecutionExhibit 345[404] is in point. What can you say in that connection?A. Apart from the general desire to turn over cases of Poles and Jewsto the police, Himmler and Bormann, as it was said once, had a specialpreference and desire for the establishment of civilian courts martial.One could not quite bypass that desire in the decree concerningPoles and Jews, but it was possible to establish an obstacle. I didso, including the provision that civilian courts martial could onlybe established with the approval of the Minister of Justice and theMinister of the Interior. Greiser, with the support of Himmler, hadrecognized that that clause or that provision would make it impossiblefor them to have their wishes fulfilled.Therefore, bypassing the Minister of Justice, they went directly toHitler. Lammers, by order of Hitler, informed me that Hitler haddecided that the demand for the establishment of civilian courtsmartial and the transfer of rightful pardon should be granted.What I had always tried to achieve by various means had not beenachieved; on the contrary, that which I had tried to avoid had cometrue. By the decision on the part of the Fuehrer, my hands were tied.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *_CROSS-EXAMINATION_       *       *       *       *       *       *       *MR. LAFOLLETTE: Now I believe you testified on directexamination that you yourself had no anti-Semitic feelings as suchagainst the Jews as a race; that also you sought justice rather than toclassify people as groups. That, as I gather, was right?DEFENDANT SCHLEGELBERGER: Yes, that is correct.Q. If then you extended the Nuernberg laws[405] by decree into theeastern territories, that would be a little inconsistent with your ownfeeling about the matter, would it not?A. Certainly not.Q. May I hand you a copy of an order of the 31 May 1941 which asI read it has the effect of extending those laws into the easternterritories. This order was signed by you. That is the prosecutionsdocument NG-1615, which we asked to have marked for identification asProsecution Exhibit 521,[406] Your Honor.If Your Honors please, if the Tribunal will permit me, I have hadEnglish copies of this and I thought they were here. I am advised thatthey are not in here now. I will furnish them. May I proceed and thenfurnish them to the Tribunal?Have you examined that exhibit, Doctor?A. Yes.Q. It is signed by you as Acting Reich Minister of Justice, MartinBormann, and Dr. Stuckart. Is that correct?A. Yes. There are two decrees on the same day.Q. Yes. Article 3 provides the Act for the Protection of German Bloodand Honor of 15 September 1935 shall be applicable in the annexedeastern territories. That is what is known as the Nuernberg law, is itnot?A. Yes.Q. That was applied to the eastern territories?A. In regard to this decree, I would like to say something, if I may.Q. Surely.A. These two decrees of 31 May 1941; the first one is an orderintroducing it; and the second one is the executive order of the Lawfor the Protection of German Blood and Honor. They have to be lookedat together. As far as the basic question of the introduction of thatlaw is concerned, the prosecutor has already spoken about my personalfeelings. I shall leave them out of consideration for the moment. Inregard to the question as to whether the Nuernberg laws were supposedto be introduced, the following were the decisive legal sources:First, here too the directives of policy which Hitler had issued;secondly, the political responsibility of the Ministry of the Interior,as the central office for questions regarding the eastern territories,and the leader of the Party Chancellery.The Ministry of Justice in regard to these laws participated onlybecause the so-called law for the Protection of German Blood and Honor,by which Minister Guertner was completely surprised at the time,contained a penal regulation. If now, in accordance with the politicaldirectives, one had to introduce this decree, the penal regulation, ofcourse, had to be introduced too, and from that resulted, of necessity,the signature. Moreover, from the connection of these two decrees, itis apparent without any doubt that the decrees do not apply to Poles,either Jews or non-Jews, but only to German citizens, and that they hadto comply is obvious.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *          EXTRACTS FROM THE TESTIMONY OF DEFENDANT KLEMM[407]_DIRECT EXAMINATION_       *       *       *       *       *       *       *DR. SCHILF (counsel for defendant Klemm): We come now tothe third phase of your activity, namely, your activity in the PartyChancellery in Munich.[408] I ask you, first of all, how did it happenthat you came into the Party Chancellery at all? Please also tell theexact dates to the Tribunal first.DEFENDANT KLEMM: I began my activities in Munich on 17 March1941. At that time the Party Chancellery did not exist at all. At thattime there was only the staff of the Deputy of the Fuehrer, and thatwas Reich Minister Hess. Reichsleiter Bormann who had the position ofchief of staff was not in Munich at all, but since the beginning ofthe war, in the Fuehrer Headquarters in the immediate proximity ofthe Fuehrer. That remained the same way during the entire course ofthe war. From the Party Chancellery I knew the chief of DepartmentIII, that is Under Secretary Klopfer. I have known him since 1924 or1925; that is, from my student days. We had not seen each other at allfor 1 or 2 years and had not written to each other. We met by chancein Berlin in January 1941 in front of the Reich Chancellery, on theoccasion of the funeral of the Reich Minister of Justice Guertner. Ihad come for this funeral from The Hague and Klopfer happened to be inBerlin. At that time Klopfer had just been given Department III in thestaff of the Deputy of the Fuehrer, and he asked me whether I wouldlike to work in his department, and to take over the group in charge ofthe administration of justice. That group consisted at that time of twoor three people, and there was no group leader because he was employedin other matters.Q. I believe that is sufficient to describe the cause--A. I said at the time to Klopfer that I liked it very much at TheHague; that I had an independent position there. I was able to workindependently, but during the war things were not done in accordancewith the personal wishes of a person; that I would work wherever I wasassigned to work. I never heard anything about it again until one daySeyss-Inquart called me to him and told me that he had had a lengthycorrespondence with the Party Chancellery, that the Chancellery hadasked for me, that he had fought against this, but in the end had togive in after all. And he had agreed to the chief of staff of theDeputy of the Fuehrer to put me at his disposal, and therefore, heinstructed me to start my service in Munich 4 days or a week later.That is how I entered the staff of the Deputy of the Fuehrer at thetime.Q. Before we now turn to your activities in detail in the PartyChancellery, it seems to be necessary to tell the Tribunal the mostimportant facts about the organizational structure of the PartyChancellery or the staff of the Deputy of the Fuehrer. You know thatthe Party Chancellery has a bad reputation. We want to tell theTribunal first the outside organizational structure.A. The staff of the Deputy of the Fuehrer had that name until themiddle of May 1941, until the time when Reich Minister Hess--that isthe Deputy of the Fuehrer--secretly flew to England.[409] At that timethe staff was transformed into the Party Chancellery, and for the sakeof simplicity I shall only use the name Party Chancellery from now on.The Party Chancellery was an organization with, in my estimation, from750 to 1,000 persons. There was one office in Munich and one in Berlin.The Party Chancellery was divided into three divisions, and thesedivisions were again subdivided into groups:Division I, which is of no interest here, was in charge of management,building, and maintenance; and in that division the personnel of theParty Chancellery itself was administered. Furthermore, the registrywas there and the telegraph and teletype system.The nucleus of the Party Chancellery as a Party office was Division II,the Party political division. Here was the actual leadership of theParty, that is, the NSDAP, and here was the direct channel to the Gaue,the Kreise, and the local groups. A certain Friedrichs was in charge ofthis division.Division III was the State or constitutional division as it was called.Under Secretary Dr. Klopfer was in charge of it. Here everything wasdealt with which had to do with the State and the State functions ofthe Party Chancellery, while, as I have already stated, purely Partymatters were dealt with in Division II.Q. Would you please explain to the Tribunal the contrast between thisoffice, the Party Chancellery, and the purely Party offices of theNSDAP?A. In addition to the Party Chancellery, the Party had differentoffices on the level of the Reich leadership, for instance, to citeexamples, the Reich Legal Office, the Office for Agricultural Policy,and the Office for Public Welfare. Thus, there were a number ofdifferent agencies. Party jurisdiction went through up to the supremeParty court. It also was divided into Gau and Kreis courts. In additionto that there were also, of course, some other Reich offices, suchas the office for Reich propaganda matters and Reich organizationaldirection, and so on.Within the Party Chancellery, in addition to these three divisions,there was also the so-called Reichsleiter Bureau, Reich Leader Office.That was, so to speak, the staff formerly closest around Reich MinisterHess and later on around Reichsleiter Bormann. This Reich Leader OfficeBureau, which at times had up to three jurists on its staff, met partlyin Munich and partly in Berlin, in the office there, and partly at theFuehrer Headquarters immediately with Bormann.Q. You spoke of Division III as the State or constitutional division. Iask you whether it was anchored on a legal basis.A. If I speak of a state or constitutional division, I give it thisdesignation because of the nature of the work of that division.Division III was, so to speak, the counterpart of the Stateorganization in the Party sector. Division III was divided into sevengroups. I shall describe this organization somewhat later.By virtue of the law to secure the unity of Party and State,[410] theDeputy of the Fuehrer had been made a Reich Minister. Supplementarydecrees, and orders laid down that the Deputy of the Fuehrer, had toparticipate in the making of national laws and ordinances, by having toapprove the drafts of such decrees. This right was then transferred tothe leader of the Party Chancellery, and in a more stringent form--asthe witness Schlegelberger has already testified--quite clearly in acircular, or perhaps in an ordinance it was repeatedly stated thatthe leader of the Party Chancellery always had the position of aparticipating minister. In the same way as in the purely legislativefield, the Deputy of the Fuehrer entered into personnel matters ofthe government. No higher official could be employed or promoted ifthis measure in the State sector was not approved by the Deputy of theFuehrer and later by the leader of the Party Chancellery.In order to fulfill these State and constitutional functions, DivisionIII had been formed in the Party Chancellery, or rather earlier, inthe staff of the Deputy of the Fuehrer. As I have already stated, itconsisted of seven groups:Group III-A, above all, dealt with the sphere of the Reich Ministry ofthe Interior and questions of nationality [Volkstum]. During the lastperiod of my time in Munich, the witness Anker, who was examined hereas a witness for the prosecution, was in charge of Group III.In Group III-B, all economic matters were dealt with: economics, food,traffic, mails, and armaments.Group III-C, the group of which I was in charge, dealt with laws andorders as far as they had been issued by the Ministry of Justice, andwith questions of Party law.Group III-D worked on educational and ecclesiastical questions, as wellas matters of the Foreign Office.Group III-E dealt with financial questions, and Group III-P (Paula)dealt with personnel matters; that is, all State personnel matters,without consideration of the fact as to whether they originated fromthe judiciary, the administration, finance, or anywhere else.Then there was a group, III-S, which had special tasks in the culturalfield.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *Q. Witness, you have now listed the individual groups, seven, as youstated. I now ask you to make a statement as to how the individualgroups of the Party Chancellery were in contact with each other or howthey worked together.A. In my description I omit Division I, because it only dealt withtechnical matters of the management of the office, administrativedetails within the Party Chancellery. I can limit myself to therelationship of Division II, that is the purely Party politicaldivision, and Division III. These two divisions worked not witheach other but against each other. Already this structure was quitearbitrary and unorganized. For example there were fields of work whichhad the same name in both divisions. In the course of time DivisionII arrogated this to itself. This battle between the two divisionswas not based only on purely factual reasons in the fields of work butalso had other deeper reasons. In Division III officials were workingwho had almost exclusively been detailed by their ministries for suchwork. In Division II only political leaders were working whole timewho, for the most part, looked down upon the jurists with contempt.The word jurist was a kind of epithet, and they saw in the people ofDivision III only civil servants and deputies of the ministries. Theydid not concede that we did any political work at all, and especiallynot work of a party political nature. They did not acknowledge us aspolitical leaders at all. We in Division III were only a necessaryevil in the Party Chancellery; that is how they saw things, becausewithout the experts they could not get along. This disrespect--Icannot call it anything else--this disrespect on the part of DivisionII was especially strengthened by the attitude of Bormann towardDivision III. He had approximately the same attitude. The result wasthat between Divisions II and III there was a constant malicious fightfor competency. Division II constantly tried to arrogate to itselfmatters which could have something remotely to do with Party matters.These attempts took place also when State matters were predominantlyor exclusively concerned; that is, if the effects would take placein the State sector. This situation was favored by the unbelievableconditions that existed in the registry. This registry had been builtup by laymen. In 1933 Germany had several million unemployed, and aneffort was made to find a place for these people and again give them anopportunity to make a living. The result was that people were put insuch positions only to find a place for them, people who had no ideaabout an organizational structure. In this registry, former streetcarconductors and violinists were employed, people who knew nothing aboutit. Therefore, the entries were constantly directed to wrong places andthen the other division did not let them go out. Whether a letter wentto Division II, or Division III, or directly to Bormann was in manycases just a question of luck.Q. I wanted to ask you also, in Division III was there also afinancially worse position compared with the people in Division II?A. We were paid the same way as we were paid when we were in the employof the State, while the political leaders, the Main Office politicalleaders, had their own salary scale; and I do not want to repeat here;I can refer to what the witness Anker stated who explained that apolitical leader of Division II in the same position as Anker got aboutdouble the amount of salary than an official.Q. I want to demonstrate to the Tribunal the borderline of competencybetween Divisions II and III. I have here a document which theprosecution believed they could bring into some kind of connection withyour case. It is Document NG-364, Prosecution Exhibit 108.[411] This isthe infamous letter about the lynching of Allied airmen who had bailedout. The letterhead is the NSDAP, Party Chancellery. Further, theleader of the Party Chancellery and the place from which it was sent isthe Fuehrer Headquarters. The date is 30 May 1944.A. Even though this is a circular from the Party Chancellery at a timeat which I had been out of the Party Chancellery already for 5 months,I do know that such circular letters in principle were not submittedby Division II to Division III when they were in a draft form or forcooperation, even if the police, the Wehrmacht, and the administrationof justice and their spheres of work were discussed in it.Q. The letter is signed by Bormann. In the same document, that isExhibit 108, there is contained another letter which also has the date30 May 1944. It is addressed to all Gau leaders and Kreis leaders, andrefers to Bormanns circular letter. It is signed by Friedrichs. IsFriedrichs the chief?A. Friedrichs is the chief of Department II.Q. Before, when you were speaking about the registry and the deliveryof letters, you mentioned that many letters went directly to Bormann,to the Fuehrer headquarters. Thus, these letters did not go to Munichto the divisions that had been established there. Was there anystandard in regard to the distribution of these letters, to whom theywere to be sent?A. If personal letters to Bormann in his position as Reichsleiter or assecretary of the Fuehrer were received by a minister or a Reichsleiteror a Gauleiter or any other prominent person in the service of theState or the Party, these letters always went first to Bormann in theFuehrer Headquarters. Other letters went quite frequently first toBormann. It depended entirely on who of the people I described before,who did not have the requisite training at the registry, and the mailgot such a letter into his hands and how he forwarded it. Of course,efforts were made to make as few mistakes as possible which wouldarouse Bormann. The result was that as much as possible was sent toBormann so that the reproach could not be made that he had been skipped.Q. Perhaps we can clarify this by means of an example. The prosecutionintroduced Document NG-558, Prosecution Exhibit 143.[412] This is apersonal letter which Thierack wrote to Bormann, dated 13 October1942. In this letter the information is passed on that in theextermination of Jews and Poles the administration of justice wanted togive a helping hand. In the form in which it is submitted, this letteris addressed personally by Thierack to Bormann. I am asking you whetherthis letter went via your Group III-C, that is the legal division, orwhether Bormann later sent it to your legal division and thus informedyou about it?A. Whether this letter was sent to Bormann too, by Thierack, I dontknow. It did not come to Munich to Group III-C. I personally saw thisletter for the first time here when the document was submitted.Q. We have another document here, that is NG-280, Prosecution Exhibit70.[413] It is a letter which Lammers, who was then Chief of the ReichChancellery, sent to Bormann. It is a complaint about an inadequatesentence regarding a Pole. This document contains several letters.We are here concerned with the third letter with the address: ToReichsleiter Bormann. I ask you to also make a statement in regardto this whether the legal group or you personally had this letter, asshown to you, put at your disposal.A. This letter came to Bormann personally, and in the same way asthe preceding letter from Lammers to Bormann which was written byhim personally. Group III-C, Bormann-Lammers, was not informed aboutthis correspondence. I have to add something here. Bormann had, afterall, two functions. He was leader of the Party Chancellery and he wassecretary to the Fuehrer. He stayed almost exclusively in the FuehrerHeadquarters. It was often difficult to find out whether Bormann actedas leader of the Party Chancellery or as secretary of the Fuehrer. Ina case like the one here, Exhibit 70, certainly the Fuehrer exercisedcriticism and to that extent Bormann then acted as the Fuehrerssecretary. He then referred the matter to the State sector via Lammers.In addition, an exterior circumstance must be considered betweenthe Fuehrer Headquarters and the Party Chancellery in Munich; therewere thousands of kilometers. For some time the Fuehrer headquarterswas in Vinnitsa in the Ukraine. In the immediate proximity of theFuehrer Headquarters were the field headquarters of Lammers, thatis, of the Reich Chancellery. For purely technical reasons the mailwent immediately back and forth between the Fuehrer Headquarters andLammers field headquarters.Q. Another interim question, Mr. Klemm. You characterized Bormann intwo capacities; one, as leader of the Party Chancellery, and secondly,as secretary of the Fuehrer. This letter which I am just showing toyou, however, contains the designation Reichsleiter Bormann. Was that athird capacity in which Bormann worked?A. In contrast to other Reichsleiters, as far as I know, Bormann becameReichsleiter, more or less, in title only. Goebbels, for example, wasa Reichsleiter too, because he was in charge of the Reich PropagandaOffice. On top of that, he was also Reichsleiter Goebbels, the GauLeader of Berlin. At the very moment in which Bormann became leader ofthe Party Chancellery and in addition secretary of the Fuehrer, theconcept Reichsleiter did not signify a special office or a specialfunction any more.Q. That is enough. Since you have described the geographical andtechnical conditions in which the correspondence went as a rule, I nowwant to ask you in principle, did you at all receive information aboutthat correspondence which went to Bormann to the Fuehrer Headquartersor which went from Bormann from the Fuehrer Headquarters or which wentfrom Bormann from the Fuehrer Headquarters to other State offices orParty functionaries?A. That depended. There were several possibilities. Either Bormannanswered such letters immediately himself, or those parts of the Reichleaders office which were also in the Fuehrer Headquarters dealt withthem. I have already mentioned that sometimes up to three juristsbelonged to the Reich leader office who advised Bormann.A certain proof of the fact that Bormann dealt with a matter himselfis the initials Bo. Very frequently we were not informed about suchmatters, because often they were put in the files of the secretary ofthe Fuehrer which did not concern us in the Party Chancellery after all.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *Q. Mr. Klemm, you spoke about several possibilities concerning Bormannreceiving letters or sending letters. You said it all depended on thecircumstances. I now ask you to explain to the Tribunal further whatadditional possibilities existed in order to clarify whether you wereinformed about any measures taken by Bormann or not.A. The second possibility was that Bormann wrote his decision or hisopinion on the margin of the letter and then gave it to the Referentin the Party Chancellery and left it up to him to draft the answer inaccordance with the decision he had written in the margin. Whether theanswer to the letter then formulated was signed by Bormann himself, orwhether the Referent, his group leader, or the division chief signedit, depended in each case on who signed the first letter.Q. The documents which I just mentioned were all brought into closeconnection with your person by the prosecution, apparently solelybecause the Party Chancellery is mentioned on these documents. Inow come to Document NG-412, Prosecution Exhibit 77.[414] On this,there is your name. The connection with your person is very clearhere. It concerns an approval that you gave to a draft of a law whichthe Reich Ministry of Justice had drafted on order of the PartyChancellery. The contents were retroactive application of regulationsconcerning treason. I would like to ask you on the basis of what youexplained, was this approval given on your own decision or on Bormannsinstructions?A. I did not give this approval by my own decision. In the case ofdrafts of laws in particular, Bormann always reserved the right to makethe decision for himself. In this case the letter concerned, whichthe Ministry of Justice had, among others, probably also addressed tothe leader of the Party Chancellery, was returned from the FuehrerHeadquarters. Probably on the margin it said approved, or yes, orin accordance, those were the words which Bormann used; and sincein this letter of the Ministry of Justice a wish of the Fuehrer wasreferred to which he had expressed already before in discussions, itwas quite clear for Bormann that he would agree, and in such a case Icould then sign.Q. This letter of the Party Chancellery is dated 18 June 1942 and alsohas the file number III-C; that evidently was issued by the legalgroup. I would like to ask you now to describe somewhat more in detailthe sphere of the task of the legal group.                              [_Recess_]Q. We discussed Exhibit 77, that was the approval of the PartyChancellery to a draft or law which was prepared by the Ministry ofJustice. I had asked you what matters in the legal group of the PartyChancellery were dealt with by you in addition?A. I want to summarize the tasks of the legal group briefly. First ithad to deal with laws and drafts and decrees of the Reich Ministry ofJustice, unless for reasons of their subject, they were dealt with byanother group, because that group appeared to be competent. Secondly,penal matters based on the law on insidious acts, as far as on thebasis of legal provisions the approval of the chief of the PartyChancellery was required for the prosecution. Thirdly, complaints fromParty offices or individuals against decisions by the courts. Fourth,complaints from the administration of justice against interference byParty offices into pending trials. Fifth, to observe especially civiland penal cases which concerned the Party. Sixth, matters of legalreform, and seventh, expert opinions in the field of the Party law.Q. As for the first group, approval of laws and drafts, was thatapproval of the Party Chancellery for drafts of law based on a legalfoundation?A. I have already made statements concerning that question when Iexplained why there was a Department III, the so-called state law andconstitutional law department in the Party Chancellery. The chief ofthe Party Chancellery, on the basis of certain legal provisions inthe case of any law or draft or any decree was a minister who had toparticipate in its drafting, that is to say, he had the same positionas a minister participating in legislation.Q. In discussing the first part of your activities you made thereservation that the legal group in the Party Chancellery dealt onlywith those drafts which for reasons of their subject did not belongwithin the competency of another group. Would you please elucidate tothe Tribunal what you mean by that?A. First I have to make a more general reservation. It was not the taskof individual groups of Department III or of Department III itself todisplay any political activity. The Party political elements connectedwith a problem were to be dealt with by the political offices of theParty. I had listed before the Reich Legal Office, the Office forAgrarian Policy, the Office for Public Health and others. These officeswithin the Party developed their policies through the Reichsleiterswho were in charge of these offices, and did that directly with theFuehrer. The groups of Department III, and above all not the LegalGroup, could not deal with the individually specialized matters to theextent that it would have been necessary. I have already explained thatGroup III-C comprised four to six officers. That group was balancedin the Ministry of Justice by well over 200 experts. Our tasks--andabove all because each individual in that group considered himselfa representative of the thought of the Ministry of Justice,--wereto prevent difficulties which might arise by some legal arrangementbetween the Party and the offices of the administration of justice. Forinstance, in Group III-C, we always were very skeptical to any generalclauses which were contained in a draft and laws because such generalclauses are the pets of the layman, and he sticks to them becausethat affords him the opportunity to criticize. That arrangement whichwas as such provided by law that the chief of the Party Secretariatalways had the capacity of a participating minister, was not agreed toby various sectors of the administration of the State, and thus, forinstance, Goering in his various positions which he held at the sametime, as Minister for Aviation, as Plenipotentiary of the Four YearPlan, and as chairman of the Ministerial Council for the Defense of theReich, never stuck to it, and never submitted any drafts. Likewise, theHigh Command of the Armed Forces never submitted the drafts of laws asfar as they concerned the administration of justice, penal regulations,et cetera, to the Party Chancellery. The individual group, however,the legal group could not independently deal with a draft, if problemswere dealt with in that draft which did not immediately concern thelegal group but in their essence concerned other ministries, forinstance, all questions of nationality, were dealt within GroupIII-A. For instance questions of Poles and Jews, Group III-C, to citeanother example, in the field of law concerning hereditary estates,could not decide independently. That was claimed by Group III-B, whichwas in charge of questions of food, the Food Ministry, to which thehereditary estate court belonged also. I believe these examples shouldbe sufficient.Q. You had set forth that the various subgroups of III were officescorresponding to the institutions of the State, that you would considerthe Ministry of the Interior as analogous to Group III-A. I ask younow since you mention Poles and Jews, the problems of which were tobe dealt with by III-A, whether the purpose for that was that as faras the organization of the State was concerned, the Ministry of theInterior took a leading part in dealing with these questions?A. Group III-A had dealt with these problems because it was theequivalent of the Ministry of the Interior. It was dealt with thereonly and if on the one side the Ministry of the Interior took theleading part, then Group III-C had nothing to do with those matters atall.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *Q. Then, since you worked in the Party Chancellery, Document NG-151,Prosecution Exhibit 204[415] was submitted in connection with you.It is a proposal on the part of the Reich Minister of Justice of 3August 1942, with the designation Limitation of Legal Remedies inPenal Matters for Jews. On page 108 of the German text, a letteris submitted which has the signature of Bormann. Next to Bormannssignature there is also the file note III-C, that is to say, thesymbol of the Legal Group [in the Party Chancellery].I ask you to comment on that and to tell us whether you or your LegalGroup had anything to do with that matter.A. To answer this intelligently, I have to refer to the entire documentsubmitted by the prosecution. The document comprises 25 pages, and thatletter from Bormann is put at the end. The entire procedure, however,can be understood only if one puts these various documents in thecorrect chronological order, for only then can one see how this entiredevelopment can be subdivided into three phases.On 3 August 1942, the Ministry of Justice distributes its first draft,which is draft number 1. The letter of 13 August 1942 shows theapproval of the Reich Ministry of the Interior, with supplementarysuggestions. In the meantime, however, the Ministry for Propagandaquite apparently, although there is nothing contained in this fileabout that, has made counterproposals and distributed those to alloffices concerned. That can be concluded from the fact that on 13August--that is to say, on the same day when the Ministry of theInterior first approved proposal number 1 with certain supplementaryrequests--on the very same day, the Ministry of Justice distributedsuggestions for draft number 2, at the same time referring tosuggestions made by the Ministry of Propaganda. That draft number 2was approved on 20 August 1942 by the Food Ministry, which also statedrequests for supplementation in its field, that is, in the field ofcivil administrative law. Then, on 9 September 1942, the chief of theParty Chancellery states his approval, and in that letter also therequest is expressed that the suggested draft concerning a restrictionof legal remedies for Jews should be supplemented.As for the second phase, dealing with draft number 2, there are twoevents to be noted--one, a certain activity of the Reich Chancellery,that is to say Lammers, who suggests to the General Plenipotentiary forthe Administration of the Reich, that is, the Reich Minister of theInterior, that he should see to it that these suggestions are adjustedto meet the requirements and then submitted.And the second is a letter from the Reich Leader SS of 25 August 1942,who suggests a conference regarding draft number 2. On 10 September1942, the High Command of the Wehrmacht also states its approval, andthat second phase of developments ends with the result that the leadingpart is transferred from the Ministry of Justice to the Ministry of theInterior. The final conclusion of that phase is the letter from thePlenipotentiary for the Administration of the Reich, that is to say,the Ministry of the Interior to the participating supreme offices ofthe Reich containing draft number 3. Now the third and last phase ofthis development starts, and the procedure as submitted in documentaryform by the prosecution for more than half a year does not produce anyresults as far as matters developed. In the documents submitted bythe prosecution the only further development is that on 3 April 1943the Minister of the Interior writes to the Reich Chancellery, that isto say, to Lammers and encloses a letter by Kaltenbrunner from thepolice of 8 March 1943 where the demand is made that the Jews should becompletely removed from the administration of justice. These documentsthen contain only two further notations of the Reich Chancellery of6 April 1943 and of 21 April 1943. The first notation deals with aconference between the Under Secretary Kritzinger on the part ofLammers, Reich Chancellery, Stuckart on the part of the Ministry of theInterior, and Klopfer for the Party Chancellery, the Party Secretariat.And the last notice of 21 April refers to a conference of various undersecretaries from the Reich Chancellery, Party Secretariat, Ministryof the Interior, Ministry of Justice, and Kaltenbrunner on the partof the police. The result of that conference is what we designate asthe 13th decree amending the Reich Citizen Law. The Party Chancelleryletter from 9 September 1942 does only refer to draft number 2 of theMinistry of Justice, that is the draft of 13 August 1942. The problemof removing the Jews entirely from the administration of justice andto declare them incapable of inheriting property, that problem was notall under discussion at the time when that letter was written, and thesuggestions made in that letter do not represent any change againstthe fundamental character of that draft. They supplement the draftonly to the legal systematic side. In as far as the Party Chancellerysuggests that legal remedies should be included, they are suggestionsof a minor weight compared to those that are already planned in thedraft. According to the draft, limitations were provided to appealsand revision, that is, matters which are directed to the next higherresort. Whereas in the suggestion for supplementation made by theParty Chancellery legal remedies are referred to which are normallydirected to the same court in the form of a reminder or a complaint.The next suggestion to limit the right of challenging a judge is thesame provision which is also part of the IMT charter. This letter of9 September 1942 I did not draft. Besides since it was issued morethan 1 month after the letter of 13 August, other offices must haveparticipated. Who it was in Group III-C who drafted that letter and whowas the referent dealing with the matter I can no longer tell. I cannoteven recall ever having seen that letter such as Bormann signed it.It is quite possible that I was away on a duty trip and that my deputysigned it for me.Q. I believe, Mr. Klemm, that that is sufficient.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *Q. Then, concerning Poles, Jews, and members of the Protectorate,Document 664-PS, Prosecution Exhibit 348,[416] was submitted, thatis a circular letter from Himmler with the classification of secret,and was sent to all Reich authorities. Your initial is on that letterbecause it was received in the Ministry and apparently came to yourattention. In this letter it is stated that posters such as no Jewspermitted to enter public places and stores should disappear. It wasno longer necessary to show such practice to the public because thepeople concerned by evacuating and isolating them were no longer there.I ask you, did that lead you to the conclusion that the Jews were tobe exterminated or already, at the time of this circular, had beenexterminated?A. I would never have gotten a thought of that kind. I know nothingabout the places in the East. I knew that Jews lived in a city forthemselves in Theresienstadt near Leitmeritz. On the contrary, Iremember having seen series of pictures in magazines, I believepictures from Theresienstadt were shown of the Jewish mayor, of theJewish police, also of the baths and restaurants, and similar things.Also, I believe from Warsaw, such pictures were shown in Germanillustrated magazines. One could not gather any more from that circularletter than that or conceive the thought that it had anything to dowith the extermination or anything similar to it.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *Q. In addition, Document NG-900, Prosecution Exhibit 453,[417] wassubmitted against you. This concerns a document which treated so-calledcomplaints of descent of Jews. The decisive question in this documentis whether you, from the letter which is contained in this document,which was written by the chief of the SD and the Security Police, couldgain the conviction that Jews should be exterminated. If you have thedocument in front of you--it consists of several letters--the first isof 3 May 1944, there the chief of the SD writes to the Reich Ministerof Justice in this letter, and the subject is a request for informationabout reports regarding Jews. Please comment on this.A. In regard to the first question I can only repeat what I havealready stated in regard to Prosecution Exhibit 348. No such thoughtever occurred to me. Moreover, I only saw the introductory letterof this document on which the Minister had written V--which meantVortragsanordnung, schedule of report. With that, the matter wastaken out of my sphere of activity.         EXTRACTS FROM THE TESTIMONY OF DEFENDANT ROTHAUG[418]_DIRECT EXAMINATION_       *       *       *       *       *       *       *DR. KOESSL (counsel for defendant Rothaug): It has beenasserted that you had coupled together the Katzenberger and Seilerproceedings in order to exclude the Seiler woman as a witness.[419]What was the situation there?DEFENDANT ROTHAUG: Under the German Code of Procedure, thereare always as many penal proceedings pending as there are defendants.Under certain conditions, such penal proceedings can be tried togetherfor the purpose of uniform trial and decision. That is what we calljoinder of penal cases. That joinder may be decided by the court,concerning cases which are pending with it separately. But suchjoinder may be established by the prosecution itself by one combinedindictment. That was what was done in the Katzenberger-Seiler case. Theprosecution, by filing one indictment for both defendants, had alreadyestablished the joinder prior to the files reaching the court. Thejoinder of the two cases was therefore neither due to a file preparedby me, nor to a file prepared by the court.Q. Would it have been possible for the prosecutor to proceeddifferently?A. Naturally. He could have filed separate indictments. The questionwas merely whether that would have been correct from the technicalpoint of procedure.Q. What are the legal provisions on which a joinder of penal cases isbased at the Special Court?A. A joinder is based on article XV, section 2 of the competency order.Q. When do the conditions exist for a joinder, such as demanded by thelaw?A. Such conditions can arise from all sorts of situations. They existin particular if one offense developed from another offense, and if thejudgment has to be based on the same facts. That was the case in theKatzenberger-Seiler affair, which we have been discussing.Q. What was the reason for the prosecutor to connect the two cases?A. Both cases, as is proved clearly by the opinion of the court, hadto be decided on the basis of the same facts. Therefore, a joinder wasaltogether natural and corresponded to the customary treatment such aswas applied in other cases as well.Q. What was the legal nature of such joinder?A. It was purely a measure of expediency.Q. Is a defendant entitled to ask for not combining his case with thatof another defendant because in the case of a joinder he loses evidence?A. The defendant does not have such a claim. According to the generallegal doctrine, which existed prior to 1933, a joinder is admissibleeven if, as a result of a joinder, one codefendant can no longer appearas a witness. But if it is decisive that the codefendant should appearas the witness, the two cases can be separated after all so as to havean opportunity to examine the codefendant as a witness. But that isleft entirely to the discretion of the court, and the defendant has noclaim to have that question decided in one definite way.Q. When several penal cases are combined, does that mean that allpossibility is excluded to examine one of the codefendants in the sameproceedings as a witness? I would like you to supplement your previousanswer and to tell us whether it is possible temporarily to separateproceedings.A. Such temporary separation is allowed expressly by jurisdiction.Therefore, during one proceeding, temporarily a separation can beordered. One codefendant can be examined as a witness, and after he hasbeen examined the case can be recombined.Q. Did anybody at any time--be it the prosecutor, the defensecounsel, or the defendant--during the trial make a motion to separateproceedings?A. Such a motion was not made either at the trial or outside of it byanybody. Not even the mere idea of doing that was ever mentioned, andthe reason was that at that time nobody regarded the joinder of the twocases as a defect.       *       *       *       *       *Q. In the case under discussion, was it likely that the chances of thetwo defendants might be affected by joining their cases?A. As I have stated before, the legal position of the defendants couldnot be affected, and their chances were not affected either. If onehad thought that their chances might be affected, I think in thatcase the two defense counsel would have made a motion to have the twoproceedings separated. If one wishes to judge the situation properly,one has to bear in mind the following: that is to say, one has tothink of the situation such as it would have been if the Seiler womanhad not been a codefendant but a witness. In that case, she wouldhave made no different statements at the trial than she had made ather interrogation under oath before the investigating judge, for shemade the same statements as a codefendant, and we had to discuss herstatements under oath before the investigating judge from every pointof view for the purpose of the verdict. What difference would therehave been, as far as our judgment was concerned, if she had repeatedthe same statements at the trial in her capacity as a witness? The realproblems of the proceedings would and could not have been affected inany way by that.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *PRESIDING JUDGE BRAND: Were tickets issued for admission tothe trial?DEFENDANT ROTHAUG: Yes, Your Honor.DR. KOESSL: I shall come back to those tickets later. Whatimportance had to be attributed to the fact that a trial was held infront of such a large public?DEFENDANT ROTHAUG: Under the German Code of Penal Procedure,the fact that the public is admitted to a trial constitutes oneguaranty that the proceedings will be conducted in an orderly manner.Q. Did Katzenberger have a defense counsel?A. Yes, he had.Q. Was that defense counsel a Jew?A. Yes, he was.Q. Did the Seiler woman have a defense counsel, too?A. Yes, she had.Q. What sort of a man was the defense counsel for Seiler? Was he aNational Socialist, or what was he?A. I knew him. He wasnt a National Socialist for certain. Myimpression was that he was entirely uninterested in politics anddevoted to his profession.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *Q. Now, were going to examine the statements by the witness Seiler.The statements by the witnesses Ferber, Seiler, and Dr. Baur[420] arecriticizing your method of conducting the Katzenberger case.According to the testimony of the witness Seiler, you addressed theaudience and said--The Jews are our misfortune. It is the fault ofthe Jews that this war happened. Those who have contact with the Jewswill perish through them. Racial defilement is worse than murder,and poisons the blood for generations. It can only be atoned byexterminating the offender. (_Tr. p. 1053_).Did you make remarks of that kind, or of a similar nature, or whatexactly did happen?A. That expression--The Jews are our misfortune or It is the faultof the Jews that the war happened, or Those who have contact withthe Jews will perish through them--those expressions are well knownslogans from the Stuermer, which I think appeared in large letters inevery issue of the Stuermer.PRESIDING JUDGE BRAND: Mr. Witness, the only questionbefore you is whether you used, in substance, the language which wasattributed to you. You may answer that question. We are not concernedwith who else used the same language.DEFENDANT ROTHAUG: Neither on duty nor in my private life didI use such generalizations, but the facts which have been discussedhere, and which were mentioned in that issue of the Stuermer,concerning all that I would like to give my view on one point. That isthe question as to war guilt. I can remember more or less exactly--andthat idea is also mentioned in the opinion of the judgment in the sameway in which I expressed it at the trial. Naturally, it was not thepurpose of the trial to prove that it was the fault of the Jews thatwar had broken out. The point was, however, this. As is known, bothdefendants tried to make the situations which incriminated them appearmore harmless, as if their relations had been everyday matters. Andin that connection, I remember that I put it to Katzenberger that,particularly here in Nuernberg, he must have known that such relationswere particularly dangerous even if the relations had been harmless,because, ever since 1933, he had observed the developments, and then,finally, war had broken out and the Jews were held responsible forthe war, and all these events should have caused him to be wise andto abandon relations which were bound to endanger him, even if thoserelations had been only harmless--and if they had been harmless itwould, after all, have been easy to abandon them. That thought ofwhich I made use by way of arguments, both at the trial and in my oralopinion, that thought appeared in the Stuermer. It said, if I remembercorrectly: He also mentioned the fact that it was the fault of worldJewry that war had come.[421]DR. KOESSL: Now, it has been alleged that in other cases too,you addressed the audience. What were the speeches about? What was thepurpose of those speeches?DEFENDANT ROTHAUG: I am charged with having addressed theaudience, particularly in connection with the Katzenberger case. Inaddition to the generally acknowledged fact that, under the GermanCode of Penal Procedure, trials have to be held in public, there isalso a fact that by the trial this general law consciousness should bedeepened--PRESIDING JUDGE BRAND: We have extended beyond our time forthe recess. Well take 15 minutes recess now.                               [Recess]DR. KOESSL: Witness, you came to the explanation of theconnections where you have made the so-called speeches to the audience.Will you explain the purpose and the connections for making theseso-called speeches?DEFENDANT ROTHAUG: I base myself on the fact that the reasonfor the trials being public according to the German rules of procedurewas that the conscience of law should be strengthened and that thepopulation should be educated in the meaning of the laws. Our spheredealt with entirely new legislation, new in consideration of the basison which it was founded and of its purposes; for that reason--andof course one has to consider that this new legislation providedsevere and most severe consequences, and that makes it understandablewhy I--and that was with approval of all interested offices of theadministration of justice--was of the position that it was necessaryto bring as quickly and as effectively as possible this legislationbefore the population in order to warn them because that warning in acertain sense is a justification of the severe sentence, particularlythe extent of the sentence; and that explains why I had the intentionto conduct my trials before the public and as many people as possibleand as broadly as possible. That also explains why it was not only myintention to describe the bare legal facts but the offenses regardlessin what field they were committed and to explain them from the point ofview of the doctrine of the State and from the points of view of thelegal system and the political point of view. The guiding thought forme was that it was our duty, and at the same time, our justificationbefore the public, to explain that the sentence pronounced in anyindividual case was the direct consequence of the legislation providedtherefore. It has to be added that fundamentally according to Germanrules of procedure, the sentence can only be based on the entirety ofthe trial; that is to say, that all points of view which are concernedwith the penalty or the extent of penalty have to be discussed in alldetails during the trial because that alone puts the defendant in aposition to recognize the main points which may be directed againsthim; and I also want to emphasize that at no time were lectures madefor their own purpose, but that such statements were made in connectionwith the testimony of the defendant or the witnesses at the time and atthe place where it seemed proper.Q. Ferber charges you generally, and particularly, in the caseKatzenberger.A. I intended to add, that it is therefore quite certain that atthat session I also stated my opinion concerning the problem of racedefilement on the basis of the doctrine of the State and on the basisof the legal system, and on the basis of our political and legalfoundations. That I also discussed the danger in the manner that thesethings were regarded at that time according to the legal situation, thedanger arising from the mixture of races to coming generations, that Iconsider to be a fact. What words I used and what thoughts I may haveexpressed in detail in discussing these matters, that, of course, Icould no longer tell today. But what I object to is the assertion thatthese may have been statements of the level of the Stuermer; and withabsolute certainty I should like to exclude the possibility that inthat connection I demanded any physical destruction. That, according tothe law, would not have been possible. That, of course, based on thefact of the war which went far beyond any racial point of view.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *Q. The witness Seiler in her direct examination testified that she andthe defendant Katzenberger had denied under oath at various times thoserelations. Was Katzenberger heard under oath?A. No, he was not heard under oath. That was not admissible underGerman law because German law holds that the defendant had to beentirely free to use all possibilities for his defense. That isconsidered a certain guarantee to aid in finding the truth.Q. The witness Seiler also stated in her direct examination that thejudge, Rothaug, used the assumption of her guilt as the basis for theentire conduct of the trial. The reason for that discrimination in heropinion had been that Rothaug did not want to hear any answer. Did youexamine the witness Seiler thoroughly?A. Of course, she was examined thoroughly, and I may point out--andthat can be found also from reading the opinion--that this was aso-called case of circumstantial evidence, that a large number ofindividual situations of more or less importance were compiled inorder to make it possible to reconstruct the circumstances which wereof importance for the evaluation; and it was always like that, and itwas no different in this Katzenberger-Seiler case, that I discussedwith the defendants every phase and every little detail; not only inorder to completely clarify any particular action, that of course, wasthe main purpose; but beyond that it was of importance to establishwhat the point of view of the defendants was, and how they describedmatters; that is the reason why that matter took a day and a half,and in addition to that, after the examination of every witness whooffered something new, again the two defendants were heard thoroughlyconcerning the new situation. At any rate the evidence which was takenas the basis for the judgment, was discussed in all possible detail.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *Q. Among the judges concerned during the deliberations, was there anydoubt about the guilt of Katzenberger?A. I remember the deliberations very well. That conference was aspeaceful as could be; for in the course of the trial, which lasteda day and a half, the entire occurrence, as far as the facts wereconcerned based upon the statements of the defendants and on whatthe witnesses testified to, had developed into such a clear picturethat there could not have been any differences of opinion; and, aftera very short time--and I remember that very well also--we arrivedat a decision and actually started to write the judgment down, butconsidering the importance of the case, we extended the time fordeliberations so that the impression should not be given that we wantedto pronounce a hasty decision. There were no difficulties at all, thereason being that the facts themselves were of compelling logic, andthat anything else which was the consequence of the facts just arosefrom them logically and in the way one had to evaluate those thingsat that time, and of course, we could not evaluate it based upon anydifferent philosophy.Q. Which motions were made by the defense counsel?A. I would like to say with certainty that one of the defense counsel,without being able to tell who it was, made an attempt in the directionof a lenient sentence, and he was trying to combat its evaluation as aserious case, but there was no doubt left about the basic facts in thecase. That is the way I remember the case, and it must have been likethat; and that was also manifest by the calm deliberations where nopoints of argument came in existence.Q. Was any one of the associate judges of a different opinionconcerning the extent of punishment? Did any one of them vote againstthe death penalty, for instance?A. The core of the question from the very beginning was the following.PRESIDING JUDGE BRAND: Let me ask you a question. Did all ofthe judges vote for the death penalty? Answer yes or no.DEFENDANT ROTHAUG: Yes, absolutely.PRESIDING JUDGE BRAND: Next question.DR. KOESSL: At that time, among the jurists around you--butthose who were not in direct contact with the case--were there anydiscussions about that sentence?DEFENDANT ROTHAUG: In no way at all. That sentence was nevercriticized in any way or considered doubtful by jurists who were notconnected with the case which would normally be possible.      EXTRACTS FROM THE TESTIMONY OF DEFENDANT ROTHENBERGER[422]_DIRECT EXAMINATION_       *       *       *       *       *       *       *DR. WANDSCHNEIDER (counsel for defendant Rothenberger): Wecome now to a new subject which plays an important part within thescope of national socialism; that is, the Jewish question. Will youplease tell the Tribunal quite generally what your point of view isconcerning the Jewish question.DEFENDANT ROTHENBERGER: Concerning the Jewish question, therewere in the NSDAP already before 1933 two factions which opposed eachother. One was the so-called Streicher wing which put the racialproblem in the foreground. The other wing was the so-called socialwing, led originally by Gregor Strasser. Gregor Strasser, already asearly as the end of 1932, went into open opposition, and in 1934 waskilled together with Roehm. Among the men who emphasized the beliefs ofthat social group was Kaufmann. That was conditioned by the fact thatin Hamburg, of course, social problems played an important role. TheJewish question did not play the same part in Hamburg as in many otherparts of the Reich. One reason for that was that on account of a largePortuguese immigration in Hamburg, the connection to western Jewryhad been very strong for centuries; particularly the so-called goodold Hamburg families are greatly mixed by intermarriage. Furthermore,it was due to the fact that the people of Hamburg are generally moretolerant in their basic temperament.Another indication of the attitude of the people of Hamburg to the Jewswas, for instance, that the display of the so-called Stuermer boxesin Hamburg was prohibited by Reichstatthalter Kaufmann. I, of course,officially and also privately was in close contact with Jews. I knewthe advantages and disadvantages of Jewry.Q. Now, of course, it is known to you, Dr. Rothenberger, that theParty program ambiguously states its position to the Jewish question.I assume you knew the Party program at that time. Could you commenton that as to what thoughts you had concerning the attitude the Partywould take to the Jewish question?A. In the beginning of 1933, I believed that just as in many of theParty platforms many points are made which later do not play animportant role. Gradually, however, I realized that the general linebecame more severe. It is beyond doubt that any German under theinfluence of propaganda considered a limitation of the Jews in culturaland spiritual life absolutely required, and so did I. But what wasgenerally rejected in Hamburg was any method of violence, any economicexploitation and any kind of hatred. As for the general line, suchas it developed gradually in Germany, I could not change anythinganymore. In each individual case of my personal and official sphere ofinfluence, individually and from the human point of view, I helped.Q. In connection with this question, the pogroms against Jews ofNovember 1938 play a part. Will you please state to us what experiencesyou have made of these pogroms and what your attitude was.A. On the day before the pogroms--that is the night before--by wayof rumor I heard of the intention that Jewish shops were to belooted. There again to obtain information I got in touch with theReichstatthalter Kaufmann who told me that he had asked for informationin Berlin because he had also heard about it, and he had alreadyalerted the Hamburg police too. He had posted them before the Jewishshops so that nothing should happen, and in fact, in Hamburg nothingdid happen with the exception of a few individual cases. About that, inthe document submitted, NG-629--Q. I refer to Document NG-629, Prosecution Exhibit 28[423] which hasalready been mentioned.A. It also mentions that due to the attitude of ReichstatthalterKaufmann, nothing happened.Q. Will you please discuss now the question of the legal position ofJews, as far as you had to do with it.A. As for the legal point of view, of course in the course of yearsmany instances of conflict occurred to everyone; also to me. In ameeting in Berlin about various legal questions negotiations were made,and the result of these negotiations as far as it concerns questionsof civil law was passed on by me to the subordinate courts. As far asmatters of penal law were concerned, it was passed on by the GeneralProsecutor at Hamburg. The opinion which the Ministry stated at thattime in matters of civil law was just about in accordance with my ownopinion.Q. Here again we are concerned with Exhibit 28, which has alreadyrepeatedly been mentioned; specifically the point of view of theMinistry which Dr. Rothenberger mentioned and which he shared andpassed on to the subordinate officials can be found on the last page ofExhibit 28.A. If I may be permitted, I would like to point out that duringthe same press conference I mentioned two further points; one thequestion of sensational reports in the press about trials, where Ipromised to get in touch with the competent agencies to see that suchsensational reports would have to cease; and the other concerning thespeed of signing the sentences. I pointed out that no pressure shouldbe permitted to be exerted on judges so that they should be given anopportunity to work on their opinions in all peace and quiet.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *Q. Dr. Rothenberger, we will now go over to another subject. Now we aregoing to deal with the beginning of the war. I want to ask you aboutthe Jewish problem which we have already discussed. In what way did theJewish problem develop after the outbreak of the war, as far as youropinion goes.A. The outbreak of the war increased the difficulties of the Jewishproblem in Germany considerably. The situation became considerablymore acute, and in particular under the influence of propaganda. Underthat influence, naturally difficult legal conflicts arose as far asthe situation of a Jew in court proceedings was concerned. Previously,as Dr. Schlegelberger emphasized, already there had existed separatewelfare institutions for Aryans and non-Aryans. There was the NSVfor the Aryans, and there were separate welfare institutions for thenon-Aryans. For the jurisdiction, that resulted in complete uncertaintyon the part of the judges as to the question whether a Jew can beallowed to conduct proceedings without paying costs. There were courtswhich granted that privilege; there were other courts that did not. Iconsidered that a uniform jurisdiction on these matters was necessary.Naturally I was not uninfluenced by the situation then prevailing; and,therefore, I supported a proposal to the Reich Ministry of Justicethat a uniform jurisdiction should be developed to the effect thatsuch privileges were not to be granted to the Jews. The importance ofthose privileges concerning costs and nonpayment of costs has beencharacterized by Dr. Schlegelberger who said that the State makes anadvance which the person concerned has to pay back, that is to sayhe is not exempted from paying costs caused by court proceedings.The prosecution in submitting evidence read out a sentence which issupposed to have originated with me. I only want to correct the matterto say that Document NG-589, Prosecution Exhibit 372,[424] shows thatthat sentence is not mine, but was phrased by the Gau economic adviser.The other exhibits which refer to that question are NG-392--Q. Dr. Rothenberger, may I interrupt you for a moment so that we canquote the correct exhibit numbers to the Court? They are Exhibit373,[425] Exhibit 462,[426] and Exhibit 372. Would you please continue?A. The only thing I can add is that it happened fairly frequently,and that it appears altogether understandable that the Jews in orderto avoid having their property confiscated upon their emigration,transferred their property to somebody else in a fake transaction.Thus, the whole problem became more complicated and more difficult forthe courts.Q. In what way were you concerned with curtailment of Jewish legalrights which emerged in the subsequent period?A. I had to deal with that question once again in the spring of 1943.At the end of April, Thierack one day asked me to go see him and toldme that on the same day a discussion would take place, a so-calledconference of under secretaries. That conference was to be held at theReich Ministry of the Interior. I believe I had no knowledge of thosedevelopments until then.Q. May I interrupt you, Dr. Rothenberger? At the moment we areconcerned with Document NG-151, Prosecution Exhibit 204,[427] which Dr.Rothenberger wants to discuss. This Exhibit 204 is composed of a numberof letters in which a draft on curtailment of legal means and legalrecourse for Jews is discussed and in which various ministries givetheir views. Will you tell us, please, whether you had anything to dowith that matter?A. Until that conference I had nothing to do with the previous history.That is due to the fact that the first draft originates from a timebefore I had assumed office. It is dated 3 August 1942, and it issigned by Dr. Freisler. The second draft is dated 13 August, and thatalso was before I assumed office. As this was a matter concerningpenal law I was not informed about the developments during thesubsequent period. As I can see from the documents now, in September1942 the so-called GBV, the Plenipotentiary General for the ReichAdministration--that was the Reich Minister of the Interior--was incharge of the drafting and conference which I have mentioned took placeat the Reich Ministry of the Interior.Q. Would you tell us something about the course of the conference ofApril 1943?A. Thierack, before I went to the conference, handed me a draft. Thatwas the draft by the GBV of 25 September 1942. That was already 6months old by that time because the conference took place in April1943. I was annoyed anyhow that I was now to deal with a matter theprevious history of which I did not know. I had a look at the draft inThieracks office and when I had read it, I said to him that I wasagainst such far-reaching restrictions.What seemed embarrassing to me, in particular, was the provision thatif the Jew was not to swear an oath, he was yet to be punished forperjury. Thierack said to me that doesnt matter. In his somewhatbrusque and curt manner he said, You will have to go there, for I amthe minister and I cannot attend a conference of under secretaries.That, as a matter of fact, was not the custom. I went to the ReichMinistry of Interior. To begin with, I maintained reserve, because Ihad not dealt with the matter beforehand. Then I heard from the otherswho were present there that they too were against such an ordinance.Thereupon, I said that that was my personal opinion, too. Of course, Icould not say as to the ministers decision. He was in favor of it, ashe had told me beforehand.Then the provisions of that draft were dropped. Only one person who waspresent objected; that was Kaltenbrunner. Kaltenbrunner said he had toattach a decisive importance to at least two provisions becoming law.He was referring to 2 provisions which, in effect for some time, hadalready been applied, which however, required subsequent legalization.One provision was that the property of a Jew who dies goes over to theReich. He said--as is evident in detail from the exhibit--that untilnow Jewish property in the case of death had been regarded as so-calledproperty of an enemy of the State and had, therefore, been confiscatedall along. But he would like to have a legal provision, because thatwould constitute a technical administrative simplification.That provision, as I see from the file, had not been incorporated intothe draft before by the Reich Ministry of Justice, but by the ReichMinistry of Interior. It appears for the first time in the draft of 25September 1942. The Ministry of Justice, thus, did not deal with it.The second provision--PRESIDING JUDGE BRAND: Would you mind telling us what happenedto that provision?DEFENDANT ROTHENBERGER: Yes. That provision did become lawafterward. Yes, I meant to say that.The second provision which Kaltenbrunner wanted to become law andconsidered necessary was a provision, which has already been discussedhere, and it concerned handing over the penal jurisdiction overJews from the administration of justice to the police. As far as Iwas concerned that resulted in an entirely new situation, for thatprovision was not contained in the previous draft. I felt I could notassume any responsibility for such a provision, all the more so as Ihad no formal competence for penal matters. I would have to report tothe minister as I had been requested by him to do.DR. WANDSCHNEIDER: Did you make a report to Dr. Thierack?DEFENDANT ROTHENBERGER: I went to see Thierack on the sameday, and I told him that he had now for the second time confronted mewith a very embarrassing situation, by bypassing me in a fundamentalquestion of the administration of justice which did not concern meformally, but which concerned me as a jurist and as a human being. Icould not assume the responsibility and I offered him my resignation.Thierack was very angry and said, I shall decide the day when youwill leave the office. In saying that, he referred to the compulsionto which all of us were subject in time of war, that is to say, thecompulsion of not being able to leave our service voluntarily.He then added ironically, For the rest--in the future you will havenothing to do with penal matters even when I am away for I have alreadyasked Lammers to appoint a second under secretary,[428] and I shallget some help that way. I mentioned these facts briefly in anotherconnection this morning.Subsequently I had nothing to do with the ordinance. I merely readthat later, on the first of July 1943 with both provisions; it tookeffect. I felt unfree, and from that time on I stuck all the more tothe one task, which still remained to me, that is, the task of theadministration of justice proper; the strengthening of the judiciary.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *_CROSS-EXAMINATION_       *       *       *       *       *       *       *MR. KING: Dr. Rothenberger, the document which has been placedbefore you is NG-1656 [Pros. Ex. 535].[429] It is an information forthe Fuehrer report. I would like to, with your concurrence, read it.You say--After the birth of her child a full-blooded Jewess sold hermother milk to a pediatrician and concealed the fact that she was aJewess. With this milk babies of German blood were fed in a nursinghome for children. The accused will be charged with deception. Thebuyers of the milk have suffered damage for mothers milk from a Jewesscannot be regarded as food for German children. The impudent behaviorof the accused is an insult as well. Relevant charges, however, havenot been applied for, so that the parents who were unaware of the truefacts need not subsequently be worried.Do you recall the origin of this particular document?DEFENDANT ROTHENBERGER: I do not remember the facts. Itis quite impossible that I wrote this, because I never drafted theFuehrer Information. I do not even remember whether it ever came tomy attention later. I ask to be shown the original of that FuehrerInformation.Q. I will be very happy to do that, Dr. Rothenberger. Is that yourinitial?A. That shows that I have seen it later, but not at all that I wasthe author. It can be seen from the original, naturally, that theFuehrer Information had neither a date nor a signature and the FuehrerInformation also shows that there is a notation on it to the UnderSecretary--for information, that means. As I can see from the initial,it apparently came to my attention without, however, identifying myselfin any manner with the contents of that Fuehrer Information.Q. Have you finished, Dr. Rothenberger?A. Yes.Q. Your feeling, of the moment, is that you had nothing to do with theauthorship of this document?A. I consider it quite impossible that I would have identified myselfeven at that time with such an opinion.PRESIDING JUDGE BRAND: I have a question of information. Wouldyour initials have been placed on it before or after the distributionof the document?DEFENDANT ROTHENBERGER: Whenever such Fuehrer Informationswere sent out--and I cannot see that that was the case--then they wereafterward brought to my attention.[430]       *       *       *       *       *       *       *         EXTRACT FROM THE TESTIMONY OF DEFENDANT OESCHEY[431]_DIRECT EXAMINATION_       *       *       *       *       *       *       *DR. SCHUBERT (counsel for defendant Oeschey): I am now comingto the subject of violent criminals and the first case I want to referto is the case of Kaminska and Wdowen. The prosecution introducedExhibit 201, which included extracts from the official files.[432] Theprosecution also introduced affidavits, Prosecution Exhibits 229, 235,and 635.[433] Finally there is the witness Gros[434] who was heard onthose cases (_Tr. p. 2828_). Please comment on it.DEFENDANT OESCHEY: The account given of that case by thewitnesses who were heard on it gives the impression as if Kaminska hadbeen convicted merely for having thrown that stone, but that was notthe case.What was of great significance were the events which had preceded thatattack which are not mentioned by the witnesses, but which were thefactors which made that case so grave that led to its being evaluatedas the crime of a violent criminal.The witness, in giving an account of that case, omitted to mentionthat the offense began with an act of blackmail committed by the twodefendants for they approached their employer, whose name was Gundel.He was an old weak man. They asked Gundel for money to which theywere either not entitled at all or to which their title was extremelydoubtful. And when Gundel asked that they should give him some moretime, they tried to force him to give them the money by attackingGundel, that is to say, the defendant Wdowen attacked Gundel andslapped his face. That explains why Private Wanner appeared on the spotand intervened. That factor, too, was omitted by the witnesses and thatis why it was not made clear that Wanner came to the aid of Gundel andin doing so Wanner limited himself to asking the two defendants toleave Gundels room. But the witnesses omitted to mention that the twodefendants now assaulted Wanner who after all had behaved absolutelycorrectly, and Kaminska when Wanner had been able to ward off the firstattack took up a hoe and tried to attack Wanner with that hoe, andWanner was only able to evade that blow by showing presence of mind andclosing the door which happened to be between him and Kaminska. Shortlyafter Kaminska threw a stone--PRESIDING JUDGE BRAND: Wait a minute. If I remember correctly,you are merely reviewing now the findings which are contained in thetranscript of the case and which is in evidence. We have examined that.DEFENDANT OESCHEY: I merely wanted to explain that the wholeof that action did not consist of isolated facts but that it isnecessary to evaluate all those facts together in order to comprehendthe legal evaluation of the offense as a whole.DR. SCHUBERT: Witness, I now ask you to tell us what was thenationality of those two defendants.DEFENDANT OESCHEY: Wdowens nationality I am afraid I cantremember. The Kaminska woman was a Pole. Anyway, I dont think Wdowenwas a Pole.Q. Well, what was he?A. He was a Ukrainian.Q. On the basis of what provision did the prosecution file itsindictment?A. The prosecution filed an indictment on the basis of part I, section4, Number 1 of the law against Poles.[435]Q. Against whom?A. Against both defendants. If I am right--well, I am not quite surewhether my memory serves me well--(document handed to witness). AgainstKaminska the indictment was based on part I, article 4 of the lawagainst Poles and with Wdowen it was based on a crime of having aidedin somebody elses crime, articles 4 to 7 of the law against Poles.Also she was convicted on the basis of having offended against article4 of the public enemies law.Q. You saw that in the official court files?A. Yes, I saw that from the original files of the Nuernberg SpecialCourt, SG 256/43.[436]Q. Both the witnesses Pfaff and Gros today draw back from thisjudgment.[437] Gros said that he voted against it. Pfaff wasnt clearin what he said about it. My first question to you is this. Did youin any other case announce a judgment without having had at least oneassociate agree with your view, as provided by law?A. No, I never did that.Q. Did you force Gros and Pfaff to agree with you in passing the deathsentence on these defendants?A. In this case they were as free in their decision and in theiropinion as I left them in every other case.Q. What did the court say of the offense against the woman, Kaminska?Was the decision in accordance with the indictment?A. No. The court did not convict Kaminska under article 1, section 4,No. 1 of the law against Poles and among us judges there was a fairlylong discussion on that point. That is to say, we debated the questionas to whether the offense of Kaminska could be sentenced under theprovision of the law against Poles which I have just mentioned. Asfar as I remember the associate judge, Pfaff, was inclined to answerthat question in the affirmative. Gros, as well as myself, however,had doubts about that. That legal provision assumes that the violentcrime was directed against a member of the armed forces in which casethe death sentence becomes mandatory. But in view of the entire factsof the case it appeared doubtful whether Kaminska, in committing heroffense, had realized at all that the person she was attacking wasa member of the armed forces. According to the facts, that elementdid not play a part. In the view of Gros and myself, therefore, theelements needed for convicting a defendant under part I, section 4 ofthe law against Poles were lacking. The further examination had todiscover whether the offense was to be sentenced under article I ofthe decree against violent criminals of 5 December 1939.[438] Thatquestion, too, we debated at great length and that is a point whichI remember. We scrutinized quite a number of decisions made by theReich Supreme Court and studied a number of commentaries. As far as Irecollect, neither of the associate judges had any doubts about thatview.With these Reich Supreme Court decisions the legal questions had beenclarified beyond all doubt.Q. Witness, is it correct that Kaminska was not convicted under the lawagainst Poles?A. Kaminska, as the law against Poles prescribes in paragraphs II andIII, was convicted under the decree of 1939, the decree against violentcriminals, which applied to all violent criminals in Germany, and shewas convicted under that law as concerns the question of her guilt assuch and as concerns the sentence.Q. The witness Gros testified that she had been convicted for racialand political reasons. What do you have to say to that?A. That is altogether untrue. The decision was based solely on thelogical application and interpretation of the law in accordancewith the decisions of the Reich Supreme Court while taking intoconsideration the particularly difficult and dangerous conditionsprevailing in the rural districts in wartime. Such points of view asthose of race and biology and whatever else you may call them, as Ipointed out yesterday, played no part whatsoever in any of my decisionsand judgments.Q. And you will now tell us something about the Wdowen case. Thewitnesses Gros and Pfaff evidently tried to minimize that offense. Whatdo you have to say to that?A. The facts of the case can be seen from the judgment which isavailable to the Tribunal, and I therefore need not to go into anydetail. Apart from the fighting and the aid given by Kaminska, this wasa very violent and altogether unusual attack against the policemen; itwas a kind of attack on the policeman who had arrested the Kaminskawoman, and Wdowen was trying to get the policeman to release his gripon Kaminska. Gros and Pfaff as witnesses disputed that fact; one canonly refer to the fact that Wdowen himself never disputed his ownintentions and his motives.Q. What was the legal evaluation of the Wdowen offense?A. That offense by Wdowen was considered by the court as a crimeunder article IV of the decree against public enemies[439] and theindictment had given the same evaluation. I should like to point outthat assaults of that nature against police officials ever since thebeginning of the war, and that is by all courts who tried such crimes,had been sentenced under the same provisions, that is to say underarticle IV of the decree against public enemies. As a rule, the Wdowencase is by no means an exception. The need to protect particularlyrural districts and the need which became greatly increased due to thewartime conditions, and such need for protection was due to the factthat the police was very short of staff, and, because of all that, anattack of that kind on the police--who worked under very difficultconditions--always resulted in a very severe penalty.Q. Was the law against Poles applied in the Wdowen case?A. No, it wasnt. Only article IV of the law against public enemies.Q. Was the Wdowen case the subject of differences of opinion at theconsultations?A. As far as I remember, it wasnt.Q. Did the prosecution consider both defendants as meriting the deathsentence?A. The prosecution from the very beginning considered that the deathsentence should be asked for both defendants, and accordingly, itinformed the Reich Ministry of Justice before the indictment wasfiled. The Reich Ministry of Justice concurred with the view of theprosecution and approved it.DR.

ORTH (counsel for defendant Altstoetter): Do you rememberProsecution Exhibit 204, Document NG-151?[441] That document isconcerned with the events which lead up to the 13th decree concerningthe Reich Citizenship Law.[442]DEFENDANT ALTSTOETTER: Yes.Q. In article II of the draft, it was provided that when a Jew diedhis property was forfeited to the Reich and that for non-Jewish heirsand persons who were entitled to alimony, a hardship clause should beadded, is that correct?A. Yes.Q. The treatment of hereditary provisions according to the plan forthe distribution of work was to be dealt with by Department VI of theMinistry of Justice.[443] In connection with the intended contents ofthe provisions in article II of the draft, could that not justify aconclusion that you and your department had something to do with thatdecree?A. No, the order that Jewish property was to be forfeited to the Reichin case of death of a Jew was not a hereditary ruling. It was a matterof police confiscation and that concerned only the Ministry of theInterior and only that Ministry was responsible. That is evident toofrom the document itself and that from the final draft, no, not thefinal draft, the draft before the final draft, which shows that theprovision of article II, section I, originated with the Ministry of theInterior.Q. I am now going to show you the text of the 13th amendment of theReich Citizenship Law. Please have a look at article II of the decree.On the basis of this provision, do you have further indication thatDepartment VI did not have anything to do with the promulgation of thisdecree? A. Yes, the wording of these provisions, already in article I,because if Department VI, I mean the section that dealt with hereditarylaw, had had anything to do with this decree, they would have chosenthe version which existed in the civil code for hereditary rights ofthe State [Fiskus][444] which is provided there for special cases. I amreferring to article 1936 in the civil code, which has always existed.Furthermore, the provision under article II shows that hereditaryrights of Jews and non-Jews, [benefiting from the will] of a deceasedJew as such were not affected. Otherwise, one could no longer havespoken of persons entitled to inherit. According to that provision,or rather in spite of that provision, for example in the case of amixed marriage, the Jewish partner of the marriage could be or becomeheir to the non-Jewish partner. In the case of hereditary settlements,provisions would have had to be made concerning the rights of thirdpersons, that is to say, non-Jewish subsequent heirs. Furthermore,we would have had regulations concerning the legal validity oftransactions among living people, concerning the part of the estatenot comprised by inheritance regulations. Section II also mentionednon-Jewish persons entitled to receive support from the deceased,although generally in the case of death any obligation to look afterthe maintenance of third persons comes to an end.Q. If Department VI had had anything to do with the 13th decree, whatReferent of the Department would have dealt with it?A. Ministerialdirigent Dr. Hesse, Ministerial Counsellor Rexroth, orMinisterialdirigent Dr. Stagel would have dealt with it in that case.Q. Did Department VI have anything to do with the handling or carryingout the 13th decree?A. No.Q. Did you or Department VI at a later time have anything to do withthe handling of Jewish hereditary law?A. Yes, in 1944 the Minister of the Interior approached the ReichMinistry of Justice with a request concerning an executory order ofthe 13th decree, to incorporate in it provisions, which were to changeor amend article II of the Reich Citizenship Law. The ministry ofthe Interior had recognized that article II had certain defects, andtherefore asked us to find a solution concerning the hereditary law.I objected to this request from the Reich Ministry of the Interior,although the Minister of Justice was of different opinion.Q. Do you know how that matter developed further?A. As for the details of the subsequent development I do not rememberthem, but one thing I remember for certain, Hesse, with my consent,when Thierack the Minister of Justice had declared himself ready tocollaborate in the preparation of this executory order, contacted thecompetent Referent of the Ministry of the Interior, and convincedthem that the provision, purely technically, for the Reich Ministryof Interior, amounted to a basic change of the previous decree, thatis to say the 13th decree. He also told them that we didnt want tohave anything to do with this matter. The Ministry of the Interiorthen withdrew its request, and I was told by Hesse that the matterof a Jewish hereditary law would now be dropped. In effect, anexecutory order in connection with the 13th decree concerning the ReichCitizenship Law was promulgated on 1 September 1944, and that by theMinistry of the Interior alone without any participation of the ReichMinistry of Justice and without incorporating the provisions concerningarticle II of the 13th decree, which had originally been requested.Q. In summing up, Witness, I should like to ask you, is it correctthat Department VI, during your term of office, did not participate inthe making and carrying out of laws concerning confiscation of Jewishproperty and that during that time legal provisions about the exclusionof Jewish hereditary rights were not issued?A. Yes, that is true.PRESIDING JUDGE BRAND: May I ask you concerning that. I amwondering if I have the correct understanding of your testimony. Do youintend to say that this 13th decree did not change the previous law ofinheritance, the rights of inheritance, but that the only effect was toprovide for police confiscation, is that right?DEFENDANT ALTSTOETTER: Yes, yes, quite. That is my opinion.Q. Well, was it your opinion that the provision for police confiscationwas invalid?A. Invalid? Invalid, no, not invalid.Q. The courts which had to do with matters of inheritance in generalwere courts with which your department had dealt, were they not?A. Yes, Your Honor.Q. Well, when a question of inheritance under the general law cameup in the courts in which they were confronted with this 13th decreeconcerning police confiscation, what did the courts do?A. I got to know of only one single case which may be connected withthis problem, and I am thinking of a case of recognition of the rightof subsequent inheritance. The district court of appeals and theseventh civil senate of the Reich Supreme Court at the time decidedthat the right of subsequent inheritance remained legal and thatregardless of the provisions which had been issued in connection withthe Jewish problem, the estate, if a case of subsequent inheritanceoccurred, would have to be passed on to the subsequent heir. Othercases, I do not remember.Q. Was that the equivalent or did it amount to holding that the decreefor police confiscation was invalid?A. I am sorry. I did not understand.Q. The Supreme Court apparently refused to apply the provisions of thedecree for police confiscation, did it not?A. I cant say for certain. If I remember rightly the Reich SupremeCourt, concerning the question of the validity of that decree did notexpress its opinion at all.Q. Well, it didnt enforce the decree, did it?A. No, the Reich Supreme Court said, the subsequent heir who comesafter the immediate heir is not affected by that decree, and therefore,his rights remain his rights.Q. And who was the subsequent heir? Was he a Jew?A. All I remember is his name. Whether he was a Jew I dont know, but Idont think he was. Probably he was non-Jewish.Q. Well, what was your opinion as to what a court could do when thelaw of inheritance provided that one person should receive the Jewishestate and that the decree for police confiscation provided that theproperty should be confiscated?A. In practice it was like this. The law of inheritance remained as itwas from the point of view of legal theory; but the property left bya Jew which was forfeited to the Reich when the Jew died, however, nolonger existed.Q. It existed. You dont mean it vanished in the air? You mean it was--A. No, that is to say, it had now gone to the police or to the financeoffice, they had now taken into their hands the property left by theJew.Q. Then I take it in practice the courts did not enforce what you havestated would be the valid law of inheritance?A. I assume that such cases did not come before the courts.Q. Well, didnt matters of inheritance in general as to the Germanscome before the courts?A. Yes, yes they did.DR. ORTH: I think that is all.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *DR. ORTH: Please explain briefly to the Tribunal what oneunderstands under German law by matters of descent.DEFENDANT ALTSTOETTER: The fact that from the biologicalpoint of view a certain man has fathered a certain child is underthe German civil code, the decisive criterion for the status and thelegal position of the child, and therefore, also for the rights andclaims of such a child. However, as we know, it is frequently difficultto establish the true biological descent of a child, and it wasparticularly difficult at the time of the promulgation of the civilcode. Pursuant to the achievements of biological science, the Germanlegislator had established certain legal suppositions concerning thelegal descent. On the basis of those provisions the biological descentand the legal descent not infrequently appeared to be different.As science progressed, in particular in the field of biochemistry,hereditary biology, and anthropology, after the civil code had comeinto force, more and more reliable methods of science were discoveredin order to prove or at least exclude biological descent of a childfrom a certain father. As a result, litigations between father andchild became more and more frequent concerning the true biologicaldescent, that is to say, concerning the question as to whether thelegal father was also, biologically speaking, the childs father.Under German law, all those cases of litigation are described asmatters of descent. A partial complex is formed by those cases whereJews and persons of mixed descent, in the majority already adults,wanted the matter clarified in a court for themselves or their progeny,that contrary to the legal supposition, biologically and consequentlyalso legally, they were not--or, at any rate, not to the extent thathad been assumed--the children of a Jew or a person of mixed descent.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *PRESIDING JUDGE BRAND: Could you tell us in a few words what,if anything, your Department VI had to do with matters pertaining todescent cases such as you have described them?DEFENDANT ALTSTOETTER: Those descent cases played a great partfrom the point of view of my department exercising supervision. I shallrevert to that matter quite briefly.Q. Over whom or over what did you exercise supervision?A. The Ministry of Justice, because of the treatment to be accordedto such descent cases constantly received complaints, in particular,complaints stating that these proceedings never made any progress.Furthermore, and I shall revert to this, too, we received complaints--Q. That doesnt answer my question. I am sorry to interrupt you. Yourdepartment exercised supervision in matters pertaining to descent. Overwhom did you exercise supervision?A. We had that supervision over the courts and over the publicprosecutors.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *DR. ORTH: Witness, will you please comment again on Exhibit453?[445]DEFENDANT ALTSTOETTER: Here I have to say first, briefly, thatthe descent cases which I have just mentioned, especially the right ofthe prosecution to raise charges in descent cases, since the so-calledlaws concerning Jews were issued, were used as a means for Aryanizationas we called it. In cases, that is to say, where a man who according tothe law was considered to be a Jew was of the opinion that he was notto be considered a Jew, he himself filed a claim for the establishmentof the fact that he was not a Jew, that is, that he was not adescendant of a Jew. Or if his right to file that claim or the rightof his father to do so no longer existed because the term to do so hadexpired, he went to the public prosecutor to make the public prosecutorfile this claim. The latter was the case when a suit was filed inorder to challenge the legality of a marriage. Now in cases wherethese claims were filed in the course of the war, particularly duringthe last years of the war, considerable difficulties arose. I onlywant to mention two, but there were more of those. One was the lackof experts in the field of genetics which was caused by the war. Theother reason was the thing that had occurred with the courts in Vienna.In other courts it did not occur, as far as I know. There in Vienna aparticular difficulty arose owing to the fact that the police, as faras Jewish witnesses for these descent trials were concerned--in mostcases it was a question of so-called witnesses for the investigation orwitnesses for the purpose of comparison--that the police, as I said,for reasons of security had removed these witnesses and now refused toproduce them or to release them. That can be seen from the letter ofthe police of 3 May 1944, which is in this exhibit. Objections againstthe attitude of the police which were raised by the subdepartmentchief, Ministerialrat Rexroth, in the course of a conference with aReferent, were only successful to the extent that the police consentedin exceptional cases to produce witnesses if the Reich Minister ofJustice expressly demanded that. Moreover, the police referred to thelack of means of transportation and escort personnel caused by the war.With matters as they stood, the Reich Ministry of Justice could donothing else but to bring them to the attention of the courts in Viennathrough the president of the district court of appeals. For the peopleconcerned who desired to carry out by that suit, as I have called it,an Aryanization, the fact that these witnesses were not produced asa rule did not amount to any disadvantage. The persons concerned ontheir part, either if they had instituted the proceedings themselves intheir own interest or if they had requested of the public prosecutorto institute proceedings, had themselves presented to the publicprosecutor evidence for their assertion that they were not descendantsof a Jew or a person of mixed Jewish descent. And if the court couldnot produce the expert opinions of geneticists which officially had tobe produced and for which these witnesses for the purpose of comparisonwere needed, then the court could do nothing else but on the basisof the evidence which the Jews concerned had submitted, to decide,and that this evidence was in favor of the person filing the claim isobvious. And to that the remarks in Exhibit 453 refer, that one had toput up with it if in this manner the intentions to cover up for thetrue descent could not be prevented.Q. Witness--PRESIDING JUDGE BRAND: Let me ask you this. Concerning theseclaimants suspected of being Jews but claiming to be Aryans, how farback did they have to trace their ancestry to prove that they wereAryans?DEFENDANT ALTSTOETTER: They were not compelled to go far back.It sufficed to prove that either one of the parents was not Jewish,and if that could not be proved, they also could refer to the fact thatother ancestors of theirs were not Jewish. The question as to whether aperson was a Jew or was not a Jew was laid down in the meaning of theNuernberg laws, these laws and the decrees to carry out these laws. Butthe suits themselves were not concerned with that, but subsequently themain thing was whether--Q. Did they have to prove that their grandparents were not Jewish?A. Mr. President, we have to distinguish here--Q. Just tell me yes or no first, and then you may distinguish. Hereis a man who claims he is an Aryan. He wants to prove it. What of hisancestors must he prove were not Jews? Can you answer?A. Framed in this way, as far as these suits were concerned, I cannotanswer the question because as far as these suits were concerned thatquestion was of no importance.Q. Was he an Aryan if his grandfather was a Jew?A. He had two grandfathers and two grandmothers.Q. Yes.A. And there the distinction was made, but according to the Nuernberglaws, which were only of interest before the administrative authoritiesand not for these trials, the distinction was made whether he wasone-eighth, one-fourth, or one-half Jew, that is to say, a person ofmixed descent of that degree, or whether he was a full Aryan. But I saythat that is a question which for carrying out these descent cases wasof no importance.Q. Will you tell me then, and do it briefly, because I know you can,what did the person have to prove in order to establish in a descentcase that he was an Aryan?A. It was established, Mr. President, that contrary to the legalassumptions, he was not the descendant of that and that father. Nothingelse.Q. That is, that he was not the descendant of his purported father.A. Of the purported father according to the legal assumption.Q. That is, if the father was a Jew.A. If the father was a Jew.Q. Then he had to prove he was a bastard. Is that what you mean?A. Yes. If it was at all a question of legitimacy. There were suchcases of descent also outside of marriage, illegitimate. These descentcases were not restricted to Jews. There were not at all any specialregulations for Jews.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *           3.

The extentand the danger of these activities necessitate the most severe measuresagainst the malefactors in order to intimidate them. To begin with,the following directives should be observed:                                   IIn case of criminal acts committed by non-German civilians and whichare directed against the Reich or the occupation force, endangeringtheir safety or striking force, the death penalty is indicated inprinciple.                                  IICriminal acts contained in paragraph I, will on principle, be triedin the occupied territories only when it appears probable thatdeath sentences are going to be passed on the offenders, or, atleast, the main offenders, and if the trial and the execution of thedeath sentence can be carried out without delay. In other cases theoffenders, or, at least, the main offenders, are to be taken to Germany.                                  IIIOffenders who are being taken to Germany are subject to court martialprocedure there only if particular military interests should requirethis. German and foreign agencies will be told upon inquiries on suchoffenders that they were arrested and that the state of the proceedingdoes not allow further information.                                  IVThe commanders in the occupied territories and the judicialauthorities, within their jurisdiction, will be personally heldresponsible for the execution of this decree.                                   VThe Chief of the High Command of the Armed Forces will decide inwhich of the occupied territories this decree shall be applied. Heis authorized to furnish explanations, to issue supplements, andimplementation directives. The Reich Minister of Justice will issueimplementation directives within his jurisdiction.

The Fuehreris of the following opinion: in connection with such activitiesimprisonment, even life imprisonment, is considered as a sign ofweakness. An effective and lasting deterrent can only be achieved bydeath sentences or by measures which will keep the relatives of theperpetrator and the population in suspense concerning the fate of theperpetrator. This purpose is served by deportation to Germany.The attached directives for the prosecution of crimes correspond tothis conception of the Fuehrer. They were examined and approved by him.                                               [Signed] KEITELDistribution[449][Handwritten notes] Clarify as soon as possible.1.

[Initial] W [Warlimont] 17 December                                Secret    First Decree for the carrying out of the Fuehrers and Supreme         Commanders directives concerning the Prosecution of           Criminal Acts against the Reich or the Occupying                   Power in the Occupied TerritoriesBy virtue of chapter V of the directives of 7 December 1941 of theFuehrer and Supreme Commander concerning the prosecution of criminalacts against the Reich or the occupying power in the occupiedterritories, I order the following:                                   IThe conditions of chapter I of the directives will as a rule beapplicable in cases of--1. Assault with intent to kill.2. Espionage.3. Sabotage.4. Communist activity.5. Crimes liable to create disorder.6. Favoring of the enemy by the following means:   a. Smuggling people into a country.   b. The attempt to enlist in an enemy army.   c. Support of members of an enemy army (parachutist, etc.).7. Illegal possession of arms.                                  II(1) The criminal acts described in section I of the directives areto be tried in the occupied territories only under the followingconditions:1. It must be probable that a death sentence will be pronounced againstthe perpetrators or at least against the principal perpetrator.2. It must be possible to carry out the trial and the execution of thedeath sentence at once (on principle a week after the capture of theperpetrator).3. Special political misgivings against the immediate execution of thedeath sentence should not exist.4. Apart from the death sentence for murder or partisan activities nodeath sentence against a woman is to be expected.(2) If a sentence which has been pronounced according to section I isannulled, the trial can continue in the occupied territory, if theconditions of section I, No. 1, 3, and 4 still exist.                                  III(1) In case of criminal acts mentioned in section I of the directives,the highest judicial authority in agreement with the counterintelligence officer examines whether the conditions for a trial in theoccupied territories exist. If he agrees that they are, he orders thesession of the court martial. If he denies it, he submits the documentsto his superior commanding officer (sec. 89, par. 1 of the decree oncriminal procedure during wartime). The latter may reserve the decisionto himself.(2) The superior commanding officer renders the final decision as towhether the conditions for a trial in the occupied territories exist.If he agrees that they do, he orders the highest judicial authoritywithin his command to deal with it. If he denies it, he gives the orderto the secret field police to take the perpetrator to Germany.                                  IV(1) Perpetrators taken to Germany _will be subjected there to courtmartial proceedings_ only, if the High Command of the Armed Forcesor the superior commanding officer declare in their decision accordingto chapter III that special military reasons require court martialproceedings. If such a declaration is not made, the order that theperpetrators be taken to Germany means a transfer according to section3, paragraph 2, sentence 2 of the decree on criminal procedure duringwartime.(2) If the superior commanding officer uses his authority according toparagraph 1, he submits the documents to the High Command of the ArmedForces through official channels. The perpetrators are to be designatedprisoners of the armed forces when being transferred to the secretfield police.(3) The High Command of the Armed Forces determines the tribunal forthose perpetrators who are subjected to court martial proceedingsaccording to paragraph 1. _It may waive the competence of the armedforces tribunals._ Moreover, it can suspend the proceedings for anytime it chooses.                                   VThe trial in Germany will be held under strictest exclusion of thepublic because of the danger for national security. Foreign witnessesmay be questioned during the trial only with the permission of the HighCommand of the Armed Forces.                                  VIThe regulations on the procedure before tribunals of the ArmedForces included in the decree of the High Command of 13 September1941 concerning the situation in Norway (Armed Forces OperationalStaff/Department L (IV/Qu) No. 002034/41 top secret) and of 16September 1941 concerning the Communist revolutionary movements in theoccupied territories (Armed Forces Operational Staff/Abt. L (IV/Qu)No. 002060/41 top secret) are superseded by the directives and thisexecutive order.                                  VII(1) These directives will become effective 3 weeks after they aresigned. _They are to be applied in all occupied territories with theexception of Denmark_ until further notice.(2) The orders issued for the newly Occupied Eastern Territories arenot affected by these directives.(3) Chapter I of the directives is applicable for pending trials. Thehighest judicial authority and the superior commanding officer canaccordingly apply chapter III of this executive order in case of suchtrials. If the superior commanding officer orders that a perpetratorbe taken to Germany, chapter IV will be applicable. In case ofperpetrators who were taken to Germany before these directives becameeffective, the High Command of the Armed Forces can proceed accordingto chapter IV, paragraph 3.

I had an oral discussion in this matter on 19 December, and on24 December I had a discussion by telephone with MinisterialdirektorLehmann. He told me, that the High Command of the Armed Forces had,in principle, agreed to the draft submitted to it with regard to theexecutive order but that, nevertheless, it would give a reply inwriting. The question has not been decided whether the High Command ofthe Armed Forces within its jurisdiction, will give the right to handlethe case to the higher military court or the military courts. There isalso the necessity of settling some other questions which presumablywill be attempted in a conference of delegates in the beginning ofJanuary. It would be advisable for the Reich Ministry of Justice toawait further information from the High Command of the Armed Forces.Transfers of the cases to courts should not be expected before thesecond half of January.Experts in charge of this matter with the High Command of the ArmedForces are--    Senior Military Court Counsellor Huelle,    Military Court Counsellor Schoelz,    Ministerialrat Sack.Furthermore with the counterintelligence office of Colonel Bentivegni,Chief of Counterintelligence III.

The Special Courts in Kiel, Essen, Cologne, and Berlin withexclusive competence hitherto, are to some extent to be replaced by thePeoples Court.2. The present procedure, according to which the accused are kept incustody indefinitely by the judiciary authorities when an indictmentwas either impossible or not answering the purpose, is to be abolished.Furthermore, the Reich Minister wishes the question of the competencefor pardons settled in such a way that in cases which have been handedover to the common court authorities, these (not the authorities of thearmed forces) shall make the decision for pardon.To give consideration to these questions, a departmental meetingwith the High Command of the Armed Forces Legal Division andCounterintelligence is to be held on 2 October 1942.Berlin, 26 September 1942                                       [Typed] signed DR.

I havecontacted the High Command of the Armed Forces in this respect. Weare both of the opinion that in view of the regulations in force forkeeping secret the procedures in question, there are basic objectionsto the admission of elective defense counsel. The interests of thedefendants can be taken care of by giving them defense counselaccording to paragraph 32 of the competence regulation.

Thisdoes not exclude the application of article IV, paragraph 32 of thecompetence decree of 21 February 1940 concerning necessary defense,included in the Reich Minister of Justices executive decree of 6February 1942.[454] Foreign defendants must therefore have counsel ifthere is a possibility of the death sentence (or life imprisonment)being imposed. That is frequently the case in these trials. Anincreasing number of more copious cases with several defendants arenow coming up. Very frequently the only evidence against defendantspleading not guilty consists of statements of codefendants, so thatin view of the possibility of conflicting interests, it is onlyrarely possible to appoint _one counsel_ for _a number_ ofdefendants. Recently, seven counsel had to be appointed for one triallasting several days. At that time it was most difficult to findenough counsel in a position to take over the defense. The courseof proceedings was repeatedly interrupted owing to the inability ofcounsel to appear. In a few days another case with about 30 defendantswill come up, for which a number of counsel will presumably have to beappointed, too. A number of similar trials may be expected shortly.Such a strain for trials lasting all day for several days upon the fewlawyers, who are overworked due to their representing their draftedcolleagues, is in my opinion untenable under present circumstances.The resultant drain upon the State treasury is considerable. When thesecond court for these special cases which will soon be needed isset up, it will be next to impossible to get the requisite number ofcounsel. The interests of foreign defendants can hardly be consideredsufficiently important to justify continuous demands of this kind onstaff and public funds.I therefore suggest that the Reich Minister of Justice should lay downthe following by virtue of the powers granted in No. V of the Fuehrersdirectives of 7 December 1941:Article IV, paragraph 32 of the competence decree of 21 February 1940is not applicable. The president of the court will appoint a counselfor the defendant if the latter is unable to defend himself or if forany other special reasons it seems desirable that the defendant berepresented.

In case aregulation of the nature suggested by the Essen Special Court shouldbe considered necessary, a legal decision along the lines of the draftcould be made. The formulation of this communication intends to leaveuntouched in principle the necessity for defense in the cases concernedand only to permit individual exceptions of the compulsory regulationcontained in paragraph 32 of the competence decree (ZustVO).I consider it doubtful whether the principle of the necessity of havinga defense should be abandoned also in cases where the death sentencemay be expected. Here the existing regulations should be waived only incases of the utmost urgency.Berlin, 18 January 1943                                                  [Signed] GRAU[Answer, 1 February 1943, from the Reich Ministry of Justice, initialedby defendants Mettgenberg and von Ammon.]To Ministerialrat GrauDepartment IV suggests that section 2 of decree No. 7 of 7 December1941 be given roughly the following form:   In trials in which according to the regulations a defense   counsel has to be appointed for the defendant, the regulation   may be ignored if the president of the court is convinced that   the character of the defendant or the nature of the charge make   the assistance of a defense counsel superfluous.However, it might be expedient to obtain the comments of the Presidentof the Peoples Court, and of the chief Reich prosecutor at thePeoples Court, the presidents of the courts of appeal at Kiel andCologne and the attorneys general in Hamm, Cologne, and Kiel.Berlin, 1 February 1943                                   [Initials] V [Vollmer]                                           M [Mettgenberg] 1 February                                           A [von Ammon] 30 January[Letter, 9 February 1943, from the Reich Ministry of Justice, initialedby defendants Mettgenberg and von Ammon.]The Reich Minister of Justice                Berlin, 9 February, 1943III a 184/43 g                               _Secret_1.

[Italicizedtext crossed out in the original document.]1. The cards used for investigations for the Reich crime statisticsneed not be filled in. Likewise, notification of the penal recordsoffice will be discontinued until further notice. However, sentenceswill have to be registered in lists or on a card index in order to makepossible an entry into the penal records in due course.2. In cases of death, especially in cases of execution of NN prisoners,as well as in cases of female NN prisoners giving birth to a child,the register must be notified as prescribed by law. However, thefollowing remark has to be added: By order of the Reich Minister ofthe Interior, the entry into the death (birth) registry must bear anendorsement, saying that examination of the papers, furnishing ofinformation and of certified copies of death (birth) certificates isonly admissible with the consent of the Reich Minister of Justice.3. In case an NN prisoner sentenced to death desires to draw up apublic will, proceedings must follow No. 30, paragraph 2 of my circularordinance of 19 February 1939, article 417-III a, 318.39. The personswho assist the drawing up of the will are, if necessary, to be sworn tosecrecy. The will has to be taken into official custody according toarticle 2 of the Probate Law. The deposition receipt has to be kept bythe prosecution until further notice.4. Farewell letters by NN prisoners as well as other letters must notbe mailed. They have to be forwarded to the prosecution who will keepthem until further notice.5. If an NN prisoner who has been sentenced to death and informed ofthe forthcoming execution of the death sentence desires spiritualassistance by the prison padre, this will be granted. If necessary, thepadre must be sworn to secrecy.6. The relatives will not be informed of the death and especially ofthe execution of an NN prisoner. The press will not be informed ofthe execution of a death sentence, nor must the execution of a deathsentence be publicly announced by posters.7. The bodies of executed NN prisoners or prisoners who died from othercauses have to be turned over to the State Police for burial. Referencemust be made to the existing regulations on secrecy. It must be pointedout especially that the graves of NN prisoners must not be marked withthe names of the deceased.The bodies must not be used for teaching or research purposes.8. Legacies of NN prisoners who have been executed or died from othercauses must be kept at the prison where the sentence was served.

It has turned out to beinconvenient that the defendants learned the details of the chargesraised against them only during the trial. Also the interpretation bythe defense counsel is not always sufficient, since their French mostlyis not good enough and since the defendants were brought to the placeof the trial only shortly before it was held.The procedure adopted for Czech defendants, viz, having the indictmenttranslated to them orally by a Czech-speaking sergeant, is notpossible here since French-speaking sergeants are not available.After having given a report to Ministerialdirektor of Department IV andto the Minister, I informed Chief Reich Prosecutor Lautz on 6 October1943 that there were no objections whatever to the intended procedure.2.

KING: Will you tell us briefly what your rank was and whatyour duties were in the High Command of the Armed Forces?WITNESS LEHMANN: I was the Ministerialdirektor in the HighCommand of the Armed Forces, and I was Chief of the Legal Division ofthe Armed Forces.Q. Do you know of the so-called Nacht und Nebel Decree which was issuedin the latter part of 1941 over the signature of Keitel?A. I am very well informed as to how that came about.Q. Will you tell us briefly how the Nacht und Nebel program wassupposed to work? In other words, what was the theory upon which thisErlass or decree was issued?       *       *       *       *       *       *       *A. There arose in France, after the beginning of the Russian campaign,the resistance movement which became very active. Hitler complainedto the justice administration of the armed forces that on account oftheir attitude they were not in a position to suppress that resistancemovement. That is the general background for the Nacht und Nebel Decree.In detail this is what happened--In the beginning of October 1941 Ireceived a letter from Field Marshal Keitel--but I want to state herethat Keitel was always at headquarters, whereas I was always in Berlin.In this letter, which all my assistants have read, Keitel passed on adirective which he had received from Hitler. The letter was quite long,several pages in handwriting. In that letter, it was expressed thatHitler considered the resistance movement in France a tremendous dangerfor the German troops. It could be seen that the methods previouslyused were not sufficient to suppress that movement. There was no sensein passing sentences of prison terms--considering conditions as theywere--which were handed down after a long period. That was not theright deterrent which the armed forces should employ; therefore, newmeans would have to be found.Q. Now, Witness, you have given us some background on the history ofthe Nacht und Nebel Decree. Will you tell us with some particularityhow the Nacht und Nebel program was supposed to work? In what way werethe resisters to be handled under the Nacht und Nebel Decree?A. Yes. That was also stated in that letter by Keitel. The Fuehrerdemanded that Frenchmen who were suspected of such acts, during nightand fog--that is where the expression comes from--should be broughtacross the border and that in Germany they should be held completelyincommunicado. That should only not apply in those cases whereimmediately a death sentence could be passed in France. This measurecould be used as a deterrent but not the procedures as had been usedheretofore. That was the general plan of Hitlers which did not includeanything about the question as to who should deal with these peopleafter they had been brought to Germany.Q. Now, Witness, did you, in your position with the High Command of theArmed Forces negotiate with the Ministry of Justice regarding the Nachtund Nebel Decree?A. Yes, but not immediately. At first, in a lengthy conference withField Marshal Keitel, I tried to thwart the entire plan becauseI disagreed--I definitely disagreed with it. Details about thatconference, I am sure, are not interesting for us now. In doing that,I only had a very limited success; that is, Keitel said that he wouldbe ready to speak to the Fuehrer once more. But already on the occasionof this first conference, he stated that the Fuehrer insisted on thecarrying out of that concept and he used a term which I cannot forget.Hitler had said with reference to that--Nobody can deny that I am arevolutionary of considerable stature. Then I should know best howuprisings can be suppressed. Keitel then spoke once more to Hitler, ashe stated, but it was of no avail. According to Keitels information,Hitler said that there were things of which he understood more thanjurists do.In the conference with Keitel, I raised the question immediately as towho should deal with these matters in Germany now. Thereupon, Keitelsaid, that it would be most according to the desire of the Fuehrer ifthe Secret State Police would deal with it. But we were against thatfrom the very beginning, and also Admiral Canaris was against it withthe same severity.After the argument had gone back and forth, I received the permissionfrom Keitel to get in touch with the Ministry of Justice.Q. Do you have any reason which you can state at this time as to whyHitler preferred the Ministry of Justice rather than the army courtsystem to deal with Nacht und Nebel cases?A. That question can only have been discussed between Keitel andHitler. It was a way out which I had suggested, because under allcircumstances I wanted to achieve that these matters should continue tobe dealt with by judges, and since the aversion of Hitler against thearmed forces justice was known, it could be assumed that he would stillprefer civilian court to us.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *Q. When did you first confer with a member of the Ministry of Justiceregarding the assumption by the Ministry of Justice of the Nacht undNebel program?A. I went to see State Secretary Freisler, I believe, in October 1941.I went to Freisler because he dealt with the criminal cases in theMinistry. He was in charge of them.Q. Can you tell us what purpose you had in mind in going to Freisler;what proposition did you discuss with him?A. I discussed with him the proposition that the cases which themilitary courts in France would not keep should be taken over and triedby the civilian justice administration.Q. What was Freislers reaction to this suggestion which you made?A. He was not enthusiastic about it but he agreed that one had to tryand keep these cases for the administration of justice as such.Q. Can you tell me this? Did Freisler have the authority to agree onbehalf of the Reich Ministry of Justice to assume the trying of Nachtund Nebel cases?A. That question I can only answer by saying that Freisler told me thatfirst he had to think it over; and secondly, he had to discuss it withState Secretary Schlegelberger who was at that time in charge of theMinistry.Q. Is it your impression that Schlegelberger was the individual in theMinistry of Justice to whom Freisler went to secure permission andauthority on behalf of the Ministry of Justice to try the Nacht undNebel cases?A. That is hard to answer. I can only answer it out of my generalbackground by saying that this was a question of considerableimportance, and I thought it was quite clear that Freisler told me thathe had to ask the man who was in charge of the Ministry, the actingMinister.Q. Mr. Lehmann, on 23 December 1946 you put your name to an affidavit.Do you recall signing an affidavit about that time?A. Yes.Q. I point out to you that this affidavit is now in evidence beforethis Court as Document NG-484,[462] Prosecution Exhibit 307. I wish toread to you a statement from that affidavit, and ask you a questionconcerning it after I have read it. The statement is as follows:Schlegelberger, who was then acting Minister of Justice, was in myopinion the only person who could consent to take over these Nacht undNebel cases by the Ministry of Justice. I ask you now, do you stillagree with that statement?A. Yes, with the reservations that I have made before; as far as I wasinformed about the routine in the Ministry.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *               EXTRACTS FROM THE TESTIMONY OF DEFENDANT                          SCHLEGELBERGER[463]_DIRECT EXAMINATION_       *       *       *       *       *       *       *DR. KUBUSCHOK (defense counsel for defendant Schlegelberger):To what extent did you participate in the legislative work and theexecution of the Night and Fog Decree, the Nacht und Nebel Erlass?DEFENDANT SCHLEGELBERGER: First, I must make a temporallimitation here. The Tribunal knows that on 20 August 1942 I left theMinistry of Justice. Thus, in regard to my person, only the previousperiod can be considered. During that time the procedure, as well astaking prisoners into custody, remained exclusively in the hands of theMinistry of Justice.If I am supposed to make some statements about the decree, I wouldlike to emphasize that the jurisdiction of the Ministry did not referto the western territories, which are under consideration here. Thiswas entirely under the competence of the military commanders. Hitlerhad issued the order to Keitel that in the future merely in very clearcases, and in such cases where the death sentence could be expectedwith certainty, the military courts were to pass sentences. The restof the culprits were, for the purpose of a deterrent by the police, tobe transported to Germany to remain under the custody of the police,and--and this is the expression he used--to disappear during night andfog.The chief of the legal division of the Wehrmacht, Dr. Lehmann, realizedwhat the situation was, and after unsuccessful attempts with Keiteland with Hitler he tried to have it avoided that the prisoners be leftin the custody of the police by having them tried before the ordinarycourts. He called on Freisler. Freisler did not disagree with Lehmann,and basically asked for my agreement. I gave my approval.Here, too, I had to make a serious decision. On the one hand, thefate of the prisoners was concerned. If they were in police custody,their fate could not be controlled. On the other hand, there wasthe necessity to loosen certain regulations which formed definitecomponents of our legal system.The Fuehrer order was based on the fundamental idea that the deterringforce, through the cutting off of the prisoners from every contactwith the outside world, could be achieved in this manner. If we nowwanted--and this is the decisive question--to have the direction ofthe prisoners, if we wanted to avoid having the prisoners remainin police custody and thus not carry out Hitlers decree but breakits head, no other recourse was left to us but to conduct our courtproceedings under the point of view of secrecy, since otherwise Hitlerwould immediately have forbidden and actually prevented the fact thatordinary courts should handle these matters.However, in order to avoid any doubt, I want to emphasize expresslyin the following that I have to state we are concerned only withregulations governing proceedings. The NN prisoners were supposed,and were, to be tried materially according to the same regulationswhich would have applied to them by the courts martial in the occupiedterritories. The rules of procedure had been curtailed to the utmostextent. In German law we also know of the possibility, because of theendangering of the security of the State, that the public is excludedwhen the opinion on which the sentence is based is pronounced. We nowhad to take one more step, to issue an order to make available thepossibility that the pronouncing of the sentence itself would not bemade in public. One could not avoid the recognition that otherwise thesecrecy would not be maintained, and I have to repeat, the cases wouldhave been taken out of our hands immediately.Everything else was based on this. For example, the limitation inthe selection of defense counsel. Germany had a very eminent legalprofession, and in my opinion it was a matter of course that everylawyer fulfilled the oath of secrecy given to him by law. However,one had to realize that as with every other profession, the lawyersprofession too, during such times, was permeated with bearers of theresistance idea, and therefore, here too, a certain caution was neededand it was necessary to limit the selection of defense counsel.It is well known that in the executive order which I signed--and itwas the same as the draft submitted in the document book[464]--that Ilimited the use of foreign evidence. However, if one thinks the matterthrough correctly and thinks of the practical application, one willrealize that this limitation worked only in favor of the defendantsbecause numerous acquittals occurred according to the principle,that governs other law as well as ours, _in dubio pro reo_.In accordance with this basic attitude, it was decisive, under allcircumstances, to avoid the subsequent transfer of the NN prisoners tothe police.PRESIDING JUDGE BRAND: We will recess until 1:30 this afternoon.                          _AFTERNOON SESSION_        (_The hearing reconvened at 1330 hours, 30 June 1947_)THE MARSHAL: The Tribunal is again in session.DR. KUBUSCHOK: We have come to the discussion of the NNregulations. Will you please continue there?DEFENDANT SCHLEGELBERGER: I have taken the liberty to explainthat the purpose in including ourselves in the procedure was tocounteract Hitlers plan to have prisoners in the hands of the police.There arose a problem--If one had to consider that in the regularcourse of procedure a penalty was found which expired before the endof the war. In such cases there would not have been any possibilityto keep these people but they had to be taken over by the policeand that would have thwarted the purpose--of the inclusion of ouradministration. That, one had to consider. The matter was simple, ifthe prosecutor, after examining the facts, arrived at the result thatthe penalty had to be so low that the term would expire before theexpected end of the war because then he did not demand that a date forthe main trial be set; the procedure remained pending and the accusedremained in the custody of the administration of justice. The situationhowever could become more difficult if the prosecutor intended todemand a higher penalty which probably would expire after the end ofthe war and if the court would arrive at a more lenient sentence. Theway out could be found only by quashing the proceedings in time and inorder to do that various means could be applied. It could have been putto the court, that is, by legislation of course, to make a decisionfor this continuance, and could also put the prosecutor in a positionwhere he would demand discontinuance and then let the court decide fordiscontinuance. I took the latter approach. Therefore, I provided thatif the court wanted to deviate from the demands of the prosecution itshould inform the prosecutor so that he had the possibility to demanddiscontinuance, but with all emphasis I want to stress there can be noquestion that the courts were to be bound in any way by the demands fora penalty on the part of the prosecutor. That would have been quiteirresponsible.PRESIDING JUDGE BRAND: Dr. Schlegelberger, are you stillspeaking with reference to the NN case?DEFENDANT SCHLEGELBERGER: Yes. So, it is quite out of thequestion that the courts were to be bound in any way to the penalty asrequested by the prosecutor as Freisler has stated in a letter whichwas written for special service to Thierack and which is quite wrong,but I repeat again, the intention was only for the court to tell theprosecutor, we are arriving at a milder sentence than you requested,so as to put the prosecutor in position to demand discontinuance; thenthe matter remained in the hands of the administration of justice; thatis to say that the defendant was in the custody of the administrationof justice. May I summarize. The provisions concerning secrecy hadto be made so that the matter would not be taken out of our hands byHitler. I was faced with the problem as to whether I should refuseto take over the NN case altogether, and the Tribunal will recognizethat that would have been very simple for me. I could have held theposition that as far as my department was concerned that I had nothingto do with the matter and therefore could reject it or refuse to haveanything to do with it. But I could not take the responsibility toassist, to contribute, that the Hitler order be carried out and thatthe NN prisoners remain in the custody of the police. And, I believethat that decision has also found its justification in the findings ofthe International Military Tribunal concerning the treatment of theseprisoners in the hands of the Gestapo.[465]       *       *       *       *       *       *       *_EXAMINATION BY THE TRIBUNAL_JUDGE HARDING: Dr. Schlegelberger, you have testified thatyou favored the decree as to Poles and Jews and the taking over of NNprisoners for trial, to avoid having these people turned over to thepolice, is that correct?DEFENDANT SCHLEGELBERGER: (Nodded in the affirmative.)Q. Why was that?A. May I ask you a question, namely, does this question refer to thePoles and Jews, or as I now understand it, to the NN prisoners?Q. It applies to both.A. Well, that was for the following reason. From the cases of transferabout which I reported, I saw that the police was the instrumentof power that Hitler used in order to do away with certain peoplewithout any legal procedure, and I wanted to give those people a legalprocedure with a regular trial.Q. Now the administration of justice at one time, at least, wasresponsible for the prosecution and trial of all crimes committed inthe Reich, isnt that correct?A. Yes.Q. Was there ever an investigation with subsequent trial after 1September 1939 for the abuse or murder of a person in the hands of thepolice or in a concentration camp?A. I can answer that question by saying that the Ministry of Justiceas far as I am informed--that is, these matters were in the penalsector--interfered in every case, even in the case of abuses andconcentration camps where they could actually do something about it,only since 1939--I dont remember the exact date--these matters weretaken out of our hands through the special jurisdiction of the SS.Q. I dont believe you quite answered my question. Did the Ministry ofJustice ever call or ever prosecute a member of the police or somebodyconnected with the concentration camp because of abuse of the prisonersor murder of prisoners in their hands?A. Yes, the Ministry did so.Q. In what cases? That was after 1 September 1939.A. In any case, it did happen before September 1939. I regret, YourHonor, that I cannot give exhaustive information about this becausethose are events and trials which were outside of my official duty, butI can say with certainty and under the oath under which I am now thatbecause of abuse in concentration camps measures were taken with theutmost energy.Q. Did a person who had been handed over to the police or who was sentto a concentration camp, including Poles and other foreigners, have anyrecourse to the law as administered in the Reich, for his protection?A. Well, if these people were in the hands of the police, we couldnot extend that protection to them. As long as those people were in aconcentration camp, and to the extent that we had any jurisdiction overconcentration camps--to that extent we always intervened, if somehow orother we could find out that there had been some abuse; but later on,from 1939 on, these matters came under the special SS jurisdiction, andwe were no longer in a position to interfere[466].Q. After that these people had no recourse to the law as administeredin the Reich?A. We could not give them any legal recourse; we of the Ministry ofJustice could not extend legal protection to them.Q. Did they have any legal protection?A. Well, I would like to say there was a jurisdiction over the inmatesof the concentration camp and this was in the jurisdiction of theSS courts. That SS jurisdiction in accordance with its duty, couldintervene in the same manner as we if anything had happened, that wasthe legal protection afforded to them.Q. That was the only legal protection they had?A. Yes, I could not name any other.Q. Now, by what laws, orders, or decrees were these people left to thesole jurisdiction of the SS and the police?A. Well, the Poles and Jews, NN prisoners were only handed over to thepolice after my time in office. As long as I was in office this did nothappen.Q. I mean, by what order or decree--you speak of a time when the SS hadtheir own courts--by what order or decree--A. The SS got a special jurisdiction through a law of 1939. The handingover of Poles and Jews, of the NN prisoners, and other people tookplace through measures of the year 1942, I believe. However, I do notwant to make this statement with certainty, because it was after I hadresigned.Q. After this order setting up special jurisdiction for the SS theMinistry of Justice could not prosecute them, isnt that correct--ortry them?A. No, it couldnt.Q. Now, I have here this decree which is found in volume 2, on page55, decree of 17 October 1939, relative to the Special Courts for theSS.[467] Are you familiar with that?A. Yes.Q. After that the Ministry of Justice could not try these people forabuse or murder of persons in their hands, is that correct?A. Yes, I assume so. Please take into consideration when consideringmy answers that these matters were apart from my official activity.Therefore, I can rather give an expert opinion than a testimony as awitness.Q. Well, the effect of this decree was to deprive the people in thehands of the police of all legal recourse, is that not correct?A. The effect was in any case that they had no recourse to the ordinarymeans of administration of justice. But the SS jurisdiction in myopinion had the same duties, the same possibilities for their people aswe had.Q. The only recourse, then, was to the SS administration ofjustice--now, on page 56 there is this decree which is signed byyou, implementing that order, which places the police beyond theadministration of justice.A. I didnt quite understand.Q. I have here on page 56 of volume 2 a decree concerning thejurisdiction of SS courts and police courts in the Protectorate Bohemiaand Moravia[468] which implements to some extent the preceding decreewhich I called to your attention. This decree is signed by you, whichsets up Special Courts for the police, that is, takes them out fromunder the administration of justice. Now, this is signed by you. Do youhave any explanation of that?A. May I ask you to state the date again, just the date?Q. 15 July 1942.A. Is that an order which was cosigned by Keitel? (Document handed tothe witness.)Yes. This decree, however, I believe, has nothing to do with thematters we have discussed so far. This decree as far as I remember, wasconnected with a decree of January of the same year. In this decreeof January in the Protectorate military jurisdiction was rescinded,and only for certain cases the Commander in Chief of the Wehrmacht wasgranted the right, in the matter of attacks against the Wehrmacht,to found the competency of Wehrmacht courts. The text of this decreewhich concerns itself with the policy is almost literally the sameone as that of the decree of January 1942 regarding the Wehrmacht.Here in this decree for the police, they were concerned with certaincourts for the SS. But the Wehrmacht SS [sic], which was considered aspecial group of the SS was supposed to be treated in the same way [asthe Wehrmacht]. Therefore, after a discussion between Keitel and thecommander of the SS Wehrmacht [sic], the possibility just as it wasgiven to the Wehrmacht, was given to the SS as a fighting troop, tofound such courts. But this has nothing to do with the question of SSjurisdiction, which is another question.Q. Were there any other orders or decrees issued whereby prosecutionof SS and similar units was taken out from under the administration ofjustice, and if so, what were they?A. Yes, there was a special law about SS jurisdiction. At the moment,I cannot tell you the date, but it was from 1939. That is the civilianSS. But this decree refers to the SS as part of the Wehrmacht.Q. Well, is that the decree of 17 September 1939 that I called yourattention to?A. The decree which you were kind enough to show to me just now.MR. LAFOLLETTE: Will Your Honor permit me? It is October. YourHonor said September.JUDGE HARDING: It is October, yes.DEFENDANT SCHLEGELBERGER: Yes, 17 October 1939. That is thedecree about the SS jurisdiction.Q. After that decree, did the Ministry of Justice have any meanswhereby they could protect a person in the hands of the police in anyway whatsoever?A. In my opinion, no; and that is why I tried to keep all these peopleaway from the police. That is why I wanted to keep all these peoplewithin the sphere of the administration of justice, so that I couldprotect them.Q. Then these foreigners, Poles, and Jews in the hands of the policewere beyond any recourse of law in Germany, is that correct?A. Not in my opinion.Q. What recourse did they have?A. Well, they probably had to turn to the higher SS office and to askfor help.Q. Was that recourse in law or is that merely administrative?A. Yes. That was more administrative.JUDGE HARDING: Thats all. That answers my question.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *        EXTRACTS FROM THE TESTIMONY OF DEFENDANT VON AMMON[469]_DIRECT EXAMINATION_       *       *       *       *       *       *       *DR. KUBUSCHOK (counsel for defendant von Ammon): You havestated that you were not a confirmed National Socialist. In view ofyour attitude, did you not have conflict of conscience sometimes duringyour activity in the Ministry of Justice?DEFENDANT VON AMMON: To a certain extent I have to answeryes to that question. In my official activity, I occasionally had toapply laws or other legal regulations or had to follow instructionsissued by my superiors with which I was not quite in agreement inmy own mind. In such cases I considered it my duty to follow suchregulations and provisions which in my opinion though unpleasant wereafter all effective. Likewise, I considered it my duty to followthe instructions issued by my superiors. However, I would not haveconsidered myself obligated to follow instructions issued by mysuperiors which were contrary to law. Such illegal orders howeverwere not given to me. In such cases, however, a certain amount wasleft up to my own discretion and that happened in many cases. WhenI applied that discretion I tried as far as possible to make my ownopinion apply. Of course, the possibility in those directions were notoverly large since as a Referent I had to obtain the agreement of mysuperiors, the more important decisions. Because of my lenient attitudeI was frequently objected to, especially by my superior Vollmer and theMinister of Justice Thierack.Q. Did your attitude change when the war broke out?A. Due to the outbreak of the war nothing changed in my basic attitude.I was of the opinion that since the war had broken out, independentof its consequences for national socialism, it would bring about thedecision, to be or not to be for Germany. Therefore, I believed thatevery German had to fulfill his duty in his official position.Q. I now come to the main charge which the prosecution has raisedagainst you in regard to your dealing with the so-called NN cases.Under what circumstances were you entrusted with this new field of work?A. The distribution of the Referate [sections] was as a rule made byorder of the department chief without asking the Referent about it inadvance. Thus, I too in February 1942 was assigned by my departmentchief, Ministerial Director Crohne, to work with NN cases without myknowing for the time being what these NN cases were all about.Q. What tasks and authorization did you have as Referent of DepartmentIV of the Ministry of Justice for NN cases?A. In order to answer that question I first have to describe brieflythe competency of Departments III, IV, and V.Department III was the department for criminal legislation, DepartmentIV was for the administration of criminal law, Department V wasthe department for the administration of penalties. It belonged tothe competency of Department III; the preparations of the laws andregulations similar to laws, the housing of prisoners belonged to thecompetence of Department V and the treatment of these prisoners whilethey were in prison. Department IV, that is my department, dealt in themain with the cases against the defendants until they were sentenced bya court, including the clemency procedure. Furthermore, the issuance ofgeneral provisions regarding legal procedure in as far as DepartmentIII was concerned was not competent for this.Q. As far as Department V was competent, what authorization did you asReferent have with regulation to your superiors?A. Gramm and Mettgenberg have already testified to this, here on thewitness stand. I only have to add some supplementary remarks. AsReferent, I had to a certain extent the right to give my signature,that is to say, to a certain extent I could give written or oralstatements by order. This right for signature, however, was limited,since due to my being subordinate to the department chief, and for themost part of my activities I was subordinate also to a subdepartmentchief. During the first month of my activity in the NN cases my sectionwas directly under the department chief. A few months later, however,Mettgenberg was put in charge as a subdepartment chief between me andthe department chief. My authority in relation to my subdepartmentchief and department chief were limited through general regulationsrather carefully. The regulations applied which were contained inExhibit 510 submitted by the prosecution.[470] May I refer to theseregulations? Regarding the letters by the Ministry of Justice thatwere sent outside the Ministry of Justice which were submitted by theprosecution, in accordance with the provisions I mentioned, I didnot sign a single one finally, but all the letters after I had alsocosigned them I submitted to my subdepartment chief for signature. Hethen for the most referred them to the subdepartment chief or even tothe under secretary or to the minister. If the prosecution, contrary tothis, in this submission of several documents, stated that the lettersof the Ministry of Justice were signed by me, that is an error. Thereare throughout letters for which I did give a cosignature, that is inthe right hand lower corner, they bear my initials, but one of mysuperiors gave the final signature.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *Q. As Referent in NN cases, did you have a large staff of assistants?A. No. I never had more than one assistant, and he worked only part ofthe time in NN cases, and then only at the beginning of my activitywith NN cases. From the beginning of 1943 on I worked entirely withoutany assistance. From that time on, due to the heightened draftingfor the Wehrmacht, younger gentlemen who could be assistants, wereavailable only to a very limited extent in the Ministry of Justice.From that time on I had only a so-called Mittlerer Beamter, a civilservant in the intermediate level [of civil service] for registrationand filing.There was a special provision only for preparation of clemency pleas indeath sentence cases. For that work, I had assistance from time to time.Q. I refer to that extent to Document NG-988, Prosecution Exhibit510, the plan of distribution of work which shows further facts.Witness, please give us a survey over the periods when the generaladministration of justice participated in the NN cases.A. We can distinguish between two periods during which the generaladministration of justice was concerned with NN cases. The first periodextends from February 1942 until October 1942; the second from October1942 until September 1944, and to some extent until the end of the war.During the first period the executive regulations of the Reich Ministryof Justice of 6 February 1942[471] were decisive in their original formas they had been issued by Schlegelberger and Freisler. Two factorscharacterized this period. First, the police were involved in the NNcases only to the extent that the transportation of the NN prisonersfrom the occupied territories was carried out by the police; andsecondly, for the sentencing of NN cases only some Special Courts werecompetent. The competency of the Peoples Court did not exist at thattime, for those cases.The second period begins with the changes which were introduced soonafter Thierack assumed office. The police now also became competent tothe extent that the NN prisoners, for the detention of whom no legalreason existed any more, were transferred to the police for protectivecustody for the duration of the war.[472] And for the trying of NNcases, in addition to the individual Special Courts, the PeoplesCourt now is competent too. This second period ends with the orderthat the NN prisoners should generally be returned to the police. Thisorder was issued in September 1944. The return, however, was carriedout until the end of the war only partly so that at the end of the warnumerous NN prisoners were still in the detention of the administrationof justice.Q. We shall now turn to the first period for which the executiveregulations of 6 February 1942 were decisive. Witness, were youinvolved in the drafting of these regulations and the discussionswith the OKW which preceded this decree and which the witness Lehmanntestified about?A. No. I neither participated in the formulation of the regulationsnor in the preceding negotiations. The regulations were worked outin the departments for penal legislation, first Department II andlater III, and at that time I did not belong to either of them. Aboutthe regulations and the preceding negotiations, I heard only on theday when the regulations were issued. On that day--it was 6 February1942--the presidents of the courts of appeal and the attorneys generalof those districts in which the NN cases should in the future be tried,had been ordered to the Ministry of Justice for a discussion.Immediately preceding the beginning of the meeting my then departmentchief, Ministerial Director Crohne, had a message sent to me that Ishould come to the meeting because in future I would have to work withthe penal cases which would result from the newly issued regulations.I then attended that meeting and for the first time, from the mouth ofState Secretary Freisler, who was presiding over the meeting, I heardabout the Night and Fog Decree and the executive regulations issuedpursuant to it.Q. In the executive regulations of 6 February 1942 there are provisionsabout the limitation of foreign evidence. Paragraph 5 of the executiveregulations, Exhibit 306[473], which, however, are here only in draftform gives this regulation--The use of foreign evidence materialrequires the prior agreement of the public prosecutor. Furthermore,paragraph 4 of the same regulation provides that the senior publicprosecutor has to obtain the decision of the Reich Minister of Justicebefore he can use foreign evidence material or can agree to the useof foreign evidence material by the court. This latter regulation iscontained in Exhibit 308[474].The indictment asserts that it was one of the purposes of the NNprocedure to prevent the defendants from having access to witnesses orany other evidence. What do you have to say about this?A. First, I would like to correct you, Counsel. You quoted paragraph 4of the circular decree of 6 February 1942, and by mistake you said thatthis was the same provision as paragraph 5 which you mentioned before.These are two different regulations. First is paragraph 5 of theexecutive order of 6 February 1942. That is Exhibit 306, and the secondregulation is paragraph 4 of the circular decree of the same day, andthat is Exhibit 308.In answer to the question of what I have to say about the allegationin the indictment, that it was one of the purposes of the NN procedureto make it impossible for the defendants to have access to witnessesor any other evidence, I have to say that that assumption is entirelywrong. The limitations on foreign evidence material was not one of thepurposes of the NN procedure, but the absolutely undesired result whichresulted from the necessity of keeping the matter secret.It could never result in a disadvantage for the defendant but wouldof necessity result in favor of the defendant. The German criminalprocedure is based on the assumption that the defendant has no dutyor no authority to prove anything. Therefore, any doubt had to workin favor of the defendant. In the same way, doubts which arose out ofthe limitation of foreign evidence worked in favor of the defendant.Moreover, foreign evidence was in no way excluded altogether but itshould only be procured and used in such a way that the secrecy of theproceedings and the keeping incommunicado of the defendant would not beendangered.Q. What was the effect of the regulations about the limitation offoreign evidence in practice?A. According to my observation, in the majority of cases theseregulations did not lead to any difficulties. In many cases theclarification of the facts was accomplished by the statements of thedefendants or codefendants or on the basis of German evidence. Thiswas the case especially in the numerous cases in which simple factswere involved. Thus, for instance, in most of the cases of illegalpossession of weapons, a weapon was found in the possession of thedefendant. Beyond this, the use of foreign evidence was admissible asfar as the secrecy of the proceedings was not endangered by this. Thus,the Ministry of Justice in any case permitted that a foreign witnessnot before the court trying the case but in the occupied territoriescould be examined by an investigating judge. If this, however, did notbring about the desired result, if there still existed some doubt asto the guilt, the defendant had to be, and was, acquitted. Accordingto my observations, probably in all courts which had to deal with NNcases, a large number of acquittals were pronounced, because owing tothe limitation of foreign evidence defendants could not be convicted.I remember, in particular, extensive trials before the SpecialCourt of Oppeln against numerous defendants who were charged withparticipation in dangerous resistance movements in Belgium. Accordingto the indictment, I was under the impression that heavy sentenceswould be pronounced. In effect, however, the result of the trials wasquite different. The defendants maintained that it was not a dangerousresistance movement, but a harmless club. In view of the limitationof foreign evidence it was impossible to disprove this defense. Thus,the defendants had to be acquitted, or they could be given only slightpenalties because of participation in a club not authorized by themilitary commander.Q. Paragraph 6 of the executive orders of 6 February 1942 which havealready been mentioned--that is, Exhibit 306[475]--makes the followingprovision: The public prosecutor can, until the sentence is pronounced,withdraw the indictment or ask that the trial be postponed. The courthas to agree to the application of the prosecutor for suspension. Ifthe court wants to deviate from the application made by the publicprosecution, it has first of all, to afford them an opportunity tostate their opinion.Witness, what can you say about this regulation?A. Dr. Schlegelberger, when he was examined, commented extensively onthese regulations. I only have to add the following: The proceduredescribed was, as Dr. Schlegelberger stated, introduced in orderto prevent NN prisoners from being transferred to the police. Forthe court itself, in view of its prestige, it probably was not verypleasant. The authors of that regulation realized that too. As I saidalready in my affidavit of 17 December 1946, that is Exhibit 337[476],even Freisler said in this meeting of 6 February 1942, that with thisregulation one had reached the utmost limit of what one could expect ofthe court. The authors of this regulation, however, believed that theyhad to put up with that regulation in the interest of the NN prisoners.Q. The regulation of paragraph 6 of the executive orders which we justdiscussed--was it ever applied in practice?A. I dont believe so. The regulation was in effect only for a briefperiod. Thierack, in October 1942 soon after he became Minister,rescinded it. During the time that this regulation was in effect, asfar as I remember, only very few NN cases were tried. These were clearcases in which the court had no misgivings against agreeing with theplea of the prosecutor. If that regulation would have been applied, theMinistry certainly would have been informed about it, and I certainlywould still remember it.Q. On the changes which Thierack ordered in October 1942, Dr.Mettgenberg has commented.[477] Did you have misgivings against thesechanges, especially also against the transfer of NN prisoners to thepolice?A. The changes which Thierack made also had, without doubt, a favorableside. The unpleasant regulation of paragraph 6 of the executiveorder of 6 February 1942 was removed. Even Freisler, as I mentionedbefore, stated about it that with this regulation the outside limithad been reached of what could be expected of the courts. Now, thisbad condition was removed, that the justice authorities of theadministration had to detain persons in whose cases the reason fordetention had to be maintained by the procedure discussed by Dr.Schlegelberger. On the other hand, the transfer of the NN prisoners tothe Gestapo was without doubt unpleasant. After the competency of thegeneral administration of justice for the detention of NN prisonerswho were acquitted or whose time of arrest had been removed, it againwas returned to the armed forces. According to the provision of the NNdecree, however, the armed forces, as a rule at least, were not allowedto return these NN prisoners to the occupied territories. Neither,for the reason of keeping this matter secret, could they be set freein Germany. The only way out that Thierack saw was their detention bythe Gestapo and the OKW who in the last instance had to decide aboutthis affair agreed to the suggestion by Thierack. If now I am askedif, in regard to the treatment of the prisoners by the police, I hadmisgivings, I can answer that in the following way: The prisoners werehanded over to the police with the express provision that the detentionwas carried out only for reason of secrecy and in the interest ofkeeping the whole affair secret. Therefore, the Gestapo merely hadto detain them and not to carry out a penalty. As far as I know, inthe negotiations between Crohne and the Gestapo, the representativesof the Gestapo stated that in the case of detention of NN prisoners,they would take into consideration the fact that against the prisonerspersonally there was no longer any charge. Later on, the Reich LeaderSS also ordered expressly that the NN prisoners, who were handed overto the police, always should be put on the level of Protective CustodyI which was the most lenient level.Q. I refer to Exhibit 328[478] in regard to the last statements made bythe witness.Witness, as Mettgenberg testified in September 1944, the generaladministration of justice was again deprived of the competency for NNcases. It was ordered that NN prisoners generally should be handed backto police. What can you say about this?A. I can confirm the statements made by Dr. Mettgenberg to theirfullest extent and only have to make a few supplementary remarks. AsMettgenberg already testified, in the discussions at the OKW, whichtook place in the beginning of September 1944, the witness Hecker andI represented the Ministry of Justice. Since the matter could not bereported to Minister Thierack in advance, my department chief, Vollmer,had given me the instruction to reserve the right for the Minister tostate his opinion. I acted accordingly during the negotiations. Therepresentatives of the OKW then also agreed that the OKW would forwarda draft of the intended order of the OKW to the Ministry of Justice andthat the Ministry of Justice could then state its opinion on the draft,in writing.In place of that the OKW then sent us an already filed decree whichordered the discontinuance of the NN procedures and the transfer ofNN prisoners to the police. When I reported this to Mettgenberg andtogether with him to Vollmer, he was very much displeased about themanner of handling used by the armed forces. Vollmer said the OKWhad byplayed us in that manner, and he instructed me to talk to therepresentative of the OKW by telephone and protest against this mannerof conducting this business. He said the decisive thing, however, wasthat the regulation made by the OKW had to be accepted according to thedivision of business, as the OKW was competent for NN cases.In accordance with the instructions given by Vollmer, I then telephonedthe representative of the OKW and expressed our surprise at themanner of handling this. The representative replied that this was amisunderstanding and he regretted it very much; in any case I cantestify that on the part of Department IV of the Ministry of Justice,no agreement for these regulations was given, but that Department IVonly through force submitted to the regulation which was made withoutits agreement.Q. The meeting in the building in the Reich Military Supreme Courtin the beginning of September 1944 was presided over by Dr. WernerHuelle and at that time he was supreme judge. I submit an affidavit byDr. Huelle that was taken on 17 July 1947.[479] Following the usualintroduction formula, it reads as follows:   By order of the chief of the legal department of the Wehrmacht   I presided over the discussion in the beginning of September   1944 in the building of the Reich Military Supreme Court in   Berlin. In this meeting the question of the transfer of the NN   prisoners was dealt with. The basis of this discussion was a   Fuehrer order, which had ordered the return of the NN prisoners   to the police.   The representative of the RSHA insisted on the giving back of   the prisoners who had already been sentenced, since the will of   the Fuehrer referred also to those and by saying so he referred   to a classification which Himmler had written about to Hitler.   Although in view of this the discussion could have only the   value of a technical discussion. I consider it absolutely   possible that the referents of the Reich Ministry of Justice   reserve to themselves the right of obtaining the opinion   of their minister since they had not received instructions   from him. More exact statements I can no longer make from   memory. In what manner and by whom my office then received a   statement by the Ministry of Justice, I do not know since I   was not the Referent. With absolute certainty, however, I can   say that only the transfer to the police for the purpose of   commitment for labor for urgent armament work was considered   for which the manpower of the prisoners was needed. My   superior, Generaloberstabsrichter Dr. Lehmann, who himself   had formerly been a member of the Ministry of Justice, always   attached importance to relations without frictions with the   administration of justice, and therefore, he had the questions   which interested both offices discussed in common.PRESIDING JUDGE BRAND: Will you tell me the author of thataffidavit? I did not catch the name.DR. KUBUSCHOK: Huelle. I submit this affidavit and ask toreserve the number, von Ammon Exhibit No. 2, for this affidavit.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *DR. KUBUSCHOK: From the documents submitted by theprosecution, it is apparent that keeping NN prisoners incommunicado wasone of the main peculiarities of the NN procedure which was appliedfrom the very beginning. In the opening statement by the prosecution,among others you too are being charged with having systematicallycarried out and approved these regulations about keeping the proceduresecret. In this connection, Exhibit 319[480] is of interest. Itcontains a circular decree by the Reich Minister of Justice in whichseveral directives are given as to how agencies of the Ministry ofJustice are to handle NN cases in order not to endanger the cuttingoff of NN prisoners from the outside world. What can you say about theorigin of this circular decree?DEFENDANT VON AMMON: The circular decree was caused byreports of the Chief Public Prosecutors in Cologne and Essen, aboutthe difficulties resulting from the strict regulations about keepingthe NN prisoners incommunicado, especially when NN prisoners died, andthey had made suggestions for overcoming these difficulties. The reportof the Chief Public Prosecutor in Cologne is contained in Exhibit314.[481] In this report the decisive questions are dealt with underparagraph [II and] III. The report of the Chief Public Prosecutor inEssen was not submitted in this trial here.PRESIDING JUDGE BRAND: The morning recess--15 minutes.DR. KUBUSCHOK: Before the recess, you answered the questionas to the origin of the circular decree which we discussed. Pleasecontinue.DEFENDANT VON AMMON: The circular decree, Exhibit 319, whichtook issue with the questions raised in the reports from the seniorpublic prosecutor at Cologne and Essen was, as Mr. Mettgenberg hasalready stated here, the joint work of both Departments III and IV ofthe Ministry of Justice. I participated in the work on that particulardecree, insofar as the competence of my department was affected bydrafting the provisions contained in it. Various questions that weresettled in that circular decree did not affect the competence ofDepartment IV at all. Thus, for example, the question of burials ofNN prisoners who died a natural death while serving their sentencesand the question of the possessions they left behind was a matterfor Department V to deal with. To that extent only Department V wasresponsible for the provisions which had been worked out. Apart from mysection, there were other sections, partly in Department IV and partlyin other departments which were competent. The questions which emergedtherefore had to be dealt with by these various sections cooperating.Q. What are your comments about the contents of the circular decree ingeneral?A. By that circular decree the existing provisions concerning secrecywere not made more severe in any way. The stringent provisionsconcerning the seclusion of the NN prisoners from the outside worldhad applied since the NN decree as such had been issued. As far as wewere concerned it was a shock from the very beginning that in the caseof the death of an NN prisoner, the relatives could not be informed.That was true in the case of a natural death, as well as in the caseof a death sentence being carried out. We, naturally, were aware ofthe severity of such a provision, but we did not see any possibilityof avoiding it, but as far as that was possible within the scope ofthe severe provisions we wished to take into account the principlesof humanity. We did want to make sure that persons who had beensentenced to death would have spiritual care. We did wish to affordthem a possibility not only to leave a holographic will but also tomake a real testament before a notary or judge. We also wished thatNN prisoners who had died should have a proper funeral. That was thepurpose of the provisions in the circular decree of 6 March 1943.Q. Please comment on the more important details of that circular decree?A. The provisions under paragraphs 1, 3, and 5 of the circular decree,I believe speak for themselves. Concerning the other provisions Iwould like to say this. Paragraph 4 said that farewell letters byNN prisoners were not to be sent out. That was not a new provisionbut that was the unavoidable consequence of the NN decree, since thegeneral administration of justice had to deal with NN cases. As earlyas the first day when the NN provisions had come into force, theDepartment V, the administration of punishment, had issued a provisionto the effect that NN prisoners were not allowed any correspondence.The farewell letters of prisoners who had been sentenced to deathalso came under that provision. Paragraph 4 of the circular decreefurthermore reads that the farewell letters from NN prisoners were tobe kept in custody for the time being by the prosecution. It was to bemade sure that the farewell letters, when the NN provisions would berescinded, that is to say, at the latest at the end of the war, wouldbe passed on to the relatives. Paragraph 6 of the circular decree laiddown that the relatives were not allowed to receive information aboutthe death of NN prisoners. That was a repetition of the old provisionwhich had existed since the NN decree as such had been issued. It wasan unavoidable consequence of the NN decree as such. Paragraph 7 ofthe circular decree laid down that the dead bodies of NN prisonerswho had been executed or who had died from other causes were to beturned over to the Gestapo for their funeral. That provision is notnew and is not peculiar to the cases of NN prisoners. That is obviousfrom Document NG-257, Prosecution Exhibit 322. That document containsthe reply from Thierack to the complaint by the chief of the SecurityPolice, that this opinion had not been obtained before paragraph 7 ofthe circular decree was issued. Thieracks reply points out that thatprovision did not provide new tasks for the Gestapo. That the Gestapowas to carry out the funeral, that in itself was not of a dishonorablenature, but funerals in cases where the relatives could not take careof them, that in Germany is one of the duties of the police. Whereas,under the general regulations in such cases the corpse is offered to ananatomical institute for research purposes, an exception was made inthe case of NN prisoners, and the corpse was buried. As the provisionshows, we, of course, ordered that every NN prisoner receive a grave ofhis own which was not identified by his name, but figures or somethingof that nature.Finally, paragraph 8 of the circular decree laid down that thepossessions which NN prisoners had left behind were not to be handedover to the relatives. That also was the necessary result of theprovisions which dealt with the seclusion of the NN prisoners fromthe outside world. On the other hand, we ordered that the possessionswhich the NN prisoners had left behind were to be taken in custody bythe NN prisons and once toward the end of the war, a general publicprosecutor--concerning the watches and other articles left behind by NNprisoners, wanted to make his own regulations. Naturally, I repudiatedthat view.Q. In its opening statement the prosecution said this: If the armedforces in the occupied territories arrested the people by mistake, whoquite evidently had not been guilty of any form of resistance againstnational socialism, then those victims, for the sake of keeping theprogram secret, had to be treated in the same manner in which otherpersons were treated who succeeded in getting away with a prisonsentence. Is that correct?A. That assertion by the prosecution is not correct. First of all,I consider it out of the question that the general authorities ofthe administration of justice ever had persons handed over to themwho quite evidently had not made themselves guilty of any resistanceto the occupying powers. Persons who had been arrested were notmoved into Germany immediately after their arrest, but to begin withinvestigations were carried out inside the occupied territories andin particular the defendant was interrogated. In the course of thoseinvestigations obvious errors were soon discovered, and in that casethe person concerned was not moved to Germany but was set at libertyin the occupied territories. May I refer to the testimony by thewitness Lehmann?[482] He testified that the agency of the armed forcesin the occupied territories had issued provisions which were to makesure that as far as possible only such matters were handed over to thegeneral administration of justice which were clear cases on account ofthe evidence that had been obtained. If it did happen after all thata person who was obviously innocent was taken into Germany--I cannotremember that such a case ever occurred--there was the possibility totransfer him to the occupied territories. In this respect, I referto Documents NG-226, Prosecution Exhibit 313 and NG-205, ProsecutionExhibit 328.Q. According to the indictment one of the purposes of the NNproceedings is supposed to make it impossible for the NN prisoners tohave access to a defense counsel. What do you have to say about this?A. First of all, the same is true here that was true of the limitationof evidence obtained abroad. Certain limitations of the defensewhich had been ordered for NN proceedings were not the purpose of NNproceedings, but a consequence which resulted of necessity from theparticular manner of these proceedings and from the wartime conditions.We must distinguish between two different limitations of defense. Firstof all, a limitation of choosing a counsel; and, secondly, limitationof having counsel appointed by the court.Q. Please comment first about the limitation of the free choice ofdefense counsel.A. In respect to the seclusion of the NN prisoners from the outsideworld, which had been ordered, the executive office of the Ministry ofJustice, in carrying out the NN decree from the beginning believed thata limitation of the free choice of defense counsel was necessary, butthey believed that the provisions in paragraph 3 of the circular decreeof 6 February 1942 would be sufficient.Q. That circular decree of the 6 February 1942 is contained in Exhibit308.[483] I quote the provision concerned: The choice of a defensecounsel requires the consent of the presiding judge who can only givesuch consent with the agreement of the public prosecutor. The consentmay be withdrawn. Please continue.A. In the subsequent time, however, we found those provisions not tobe sufficient, in order to guarantee the secrecy of the proceedingswhich after all had been ordered. As the decisive document on thesubject is available to the Tribunal I can be brief. I am referringto Exhibit 314.[484] The document contains a report by the seniorpublic prosecutor at Cologne, dated 15 October 1942. In that reporthe states at length that, so as not to endanger the secrecy of theNN proceedings, he had doubts about consenting to allowing a defensecounsel to be chosen freely.Similar reports, as far as I recollect, were received from other seniorpublic prosecutors as well. The document also shows that at the ReichMinistry of Justice we only, after careful examination, decided onfurther limiting the free selection of defense counsel. From marginalnotes which, however, can only be seen on the photostat of the documentand which have not been entered in the document books, the followingis to be seen. The question of the free choice of a defense counsel, Ifirst on 22 September 1942 reported on to my subdepartment chief. Inaccordance with the result of that report of 1 December 1942, I thendiscussed the matter with the expert of the OKW over the telephone. Hefirst of all reserved his opinion, but on 12 December 1942, he toldme that the OKW took the view that the admission of defense counselselected by the defendant in NN matters was not desirable.We then contacted Department III of the Ministry of Justice, thedepartment of penal legislation, and when that department took the sameview as the OKW, Departments III and IV of the Ministry of Justiceissued the joint regulation of 21 December 1942, which is contained inDocument NG-255, Prosecution Exhibit 314.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *Q. What about the limitations concerning the necessity of defense?A. Originally concerning the necessary defense, a provision inparagraph 7 of the executive order of 26 February 1942 applied,according to which the appointment of a defense counsel required theconsent of the public prosecutor. May I point out that the followingwording of the executive order of 6 February 1942 has not beensubmitted here as a document. Exhibit 306[485] merely reproduced thedraft of that executive order. The provision concerning the necessarydefense was issued immediately before the executive decree was issued,and it is therefore not contained in the draft which we have before ushere. In the subsequent period opinions were voiced according to whichfurther limitation of defense was considered necessary. The prosecutionhas submitted Exhibit 317.[486] Although that document unfortunatelyis very incomplete, it does show that at the Special Court at Essenthere had been difficulties in appointing defense counsel as frequentlyseveral defendants were dealt with in one proceeding and, on account ofthe collision of interests, a defense counsel had to be appointed foreach defendant.It is obvious that, in view of having to maintain the work of the courtin general, the simultaneous employment of a large number of defensecounsel was not desirable. Insofar, the desire of limiting the defenseby appointed defense counsel was understandable.If the report from the presiding judge of the Special Court at Essenpoints out that the interests of the defendants did not justify somuch strain placed on manpower and material, I would point out in thisconnection that not one of the persons who dealt with the subject atthe Reich Ministry of Justice shared that view.The matter itself was then dealt with at Department III and not inour Department IV, because it concerned a proposed change of a legalregulation. The Referent of Department III then informed me of theseevents and made a suggestion of his own which unfortunately is notcontained in this document.I then reported the matter to Mr. Mettgenberg and together with himto Mr. Vollmer. The result of that report can be seen from the notemade on 1 February 1943 which is initialed by Vollmer and which alsobears Mettgenbergs and my initials.[487] That note provides forcertain limitations of defense counsel appointed by the courts, but thedocument does not show the wording of the decree as it was actuallyissued later on.What I remember is that after that decree had been issued, thelimitation of defense counsel, appointed by the courts, appliedneither to proceedings before the Peoples Court nor did it applyto those proceedings where the death sentence could be expected.How insignificant the practical effect of this limitation of theappointment of defense counsels by the courts was is revealed by theposition which defense counsel hold under German code of procedure,a position which has been discussed here repeatedly. For the rest,according to my observations, the Special Courts in practice almostalways appointed defense counsel.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *Q. Please state some details about the practice followed by the courts.A. In the final result, and that is still my conviction today,the jurisdiction of the general courts in NN cases was absolutelyadequate. This applies to the matter seen as a whole. It applies to thejurisdiction of the Peoples Court and especially to the jurisdictionof the Special Courts. In the case of the Special Courts you will seethat few death sentences were pronounced whereas the Peoples Courtin a large percentage of cases pronounced death sentences. However,the percentage of death sentences is not as high as I assumed in myaffidavit of 17 December 1946. That is Exhibit 337.[488] In thisaffidavit I stated--purely off hand, I would like to say--that themajority, that is, more than fifty percent of those indicted beforethe Peoples Court were sentenced to death. I made that statement atthe time to the best of my knowledge. However, I did not have anydocuments of any kind at my disposal, and I had to rely on my memoryalone. Today, after I take into consideration the statistical materialwhich the prosecution has submitted, I would assume that about fiftypercent of the NN cases sentenced by the Peoples Court were sentencedto death. The death sentences which the Peoples Court passed were, Ithink, justified; and I can even say from an international point ofview, the death sentence was appropriate. They were cases of espionage,guerilla activities, serious cases of aiding and abetting the enemy,as well as the support of enemy parachutists, etc. About the offenseswhich were the basis for sentences for the Peoples Court, the witnessWalter Roemer[489] also testified here in this Court. I refer to thetestimony of 24 April by this witness. I can also refer to what thedefendant Lautz[490] said here on the witness stand. After examiningthe statistical material, I have to correct another sentence from myaffidavit of 17 December 1946. In that case I stated that aiding andabetting the enemy always practically resulted in a death sentencebefore the Peoples Court. After careful consideration, however, I haveno reason for expressing the opinion that the number of death sentenceswas larger in the case of aiding and abetting the enemy than in thecase of espionage and guerilla activity. Here, too, I assume that thedeath sentence amounted to fifty percent.Characteristic sentences in these courts were those pronounced forillegal possession of arms. I have already mentioned that in the decreeissued by the military commander in normal cases the death sentencewas provided and only in lighter cases a prison sentence. In fact,only very few death sentences were pronounced because of the illegalpossession of arms. These cases were special cases, as for instancepossession of an entire ammunition depot. In an overwhelming majorityof cases--and I want to state that illegal possession of arms as faras the number of cases played an important role--only prison sentenceswere pronounced for the illegal possession of arms. The action bythe president of the district court of appeals of Katowice who inthe discussion at Oppeln instigated a more severe punishment becauseof possession of arms was at that time generally rejected. In thefew cases in which because of illegal possession of arms, the deathsentence was pronounced, almost without exception the execution of thedeath sentence was avoided by clemency pleas.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *DR. KUBUSCHOK: I now come to the clemency proceedings of theReich Ministry of Justice in death sentences pronounced for NN cases.Please comment on this.DEFENDANT VON AMMON: The clemency procedure in NN cases was inprinciple the same as in the case of other death sentences. However,there were some peculiarities. One of these was that the Gauleiter didnot participate in the clemency proceedings, because the crime hadbeen committed in occupied territory and not within the sphere of aGauleiter.A further peculiarity consisted in the fact that Hitler, as I alreadymentioned before, reserved to himself the right to make the clemencydecision in death sentences pronounced against women from the OccupiedWestern Territories.Finally, I should like to point out that in NN cases, because ofthe lack of the possibility of a deterrent, there was no so-calledlightning [Blitz] executions. The practice in regard to clemencyquestions followed by Thierack was, as has been discussed herefrequently, severe. It was not easy for a Referent to succeed ingetting clemency granted by him. Nevertheless, I succeeded in doing soin a number of cases.However, when I made the attempt to bring about the granting of aclemency plea in several cases, I became subject to the scorn ofThierack who made derogatory remarks about the obstinacy which Iapplied.Q. The NN regulations in the execution of which you had tocooperate--did you have any misgivings about them?A. In the application of the NN regulations I was, of course,conscious of their severity. I considered especially severe the strictregulations about the seclusion of NN prisoners from the outside worldwhich made any correspondence of the NN prisoners with their relativesimpossible. Furthermore, I considered very severe the regulationswhich provided that on principle also those NN prisoners, to whomno offense or at least no serious offense could be proved, shouldremain in custody. That I considered very severe. But I kept to thestatements that were made when these regulations were issued, thatthese regulations were necessary in order to suppress the increasingresistance movement in the occupied territories.The regulations issued seemed to me to be still better than--and thiswould have been possible in the case of offenses against the occupyingforces in the occupied territories--indiscriminate death sentences.As the witness Lehmann testified here, the seclusion of NN prisonersfrom the outside world was, so to say, the price to be paid for thepossibility of greater leniency in sentencing. Under this point ofview it seemed to me to be acceptable. That very strong resistancemovements existed in the occupied territories, which in a certain sensecould be considered as a second illegal army and influence the militarysituation considerably, is an historical fact.Q. Did you have an opportunity to give up your NN section and to takeover another section?A. As I already stated in the affidavit of 17 December 1946 which Iquoted repeatedly, I did not like dealing with NN cases. Whether aperson likes his special professional field is, on the whole, dependenton his inner attitude. In any case, I can say about myself that theactivity in a section in which of necessity, severity, and above all,death sentences appeared, was not to my liking, especially since peoplewere concerned who as such were not criminals and who could not bedenied a human understanding.For that reason, in the summer of 1944, I made the attempt to swap mysection with another section in the personnel division of the Ministryof Justice. At that time it was intended to promote MinisterialCounselor Wittland who was a member of the personnel division. In thatcase he would have left the Ministry of Justice. The section comprisedorganization of the courts and civil service law.At that time I requested to receive this section when Wittland wouldleave. From August 1944 until January 1945, I used part of my timein order to get acquainted with the personnel department. However,the Party Chancellery then objected to Wittlands promotion, and,therefore, it did not take place; and I had to remain in my formersection.Q. Did you regard the NN regulations as being within the framework ofinternational law?A. In answering that question, I have to make a clear distinction.The NN decree was signed by Keitel on order of Hitler. The executiveregulations for the NN decree were issued, first of all, by the OKWand for the sphere of the Ministry of Justice, by the Ministry ofJustice. The basic executive regulations of the Ministry of Justicein regard to the NN decree were not worked out by me as Referent norin my department at all. Apart from the leadership of the Ministry,the penal legislation department, Department III, was competent forthis. Department IV and I as Referent were in a certain sense merelyexecutive organs in the application of the existing legal regulations.The examination as to whether the NN decree and the basic executiveregulations were in accordance with international law was therefore upto the people who were competent for the issuance of the decree andworking on the drafting of the regulations. But the executive organneither has the duty nor the right for review as has been discussedhere frequently.Of course, as a jurist, I thought about these questions and can saythat crimes of that nature as were prosecuted as NN cases can bepunished with the most severe penalty according to international law,and that penalties of that kind are also usually applied by all statesas is obvious, I believe; that courts martial which otherwise wouldhave tried such cases in the occupied territory, were replaced by civilcourts in the home country, is also not contrary to international law.And now, as to the limiting regulations of the NN procedure, theessential factor was that a just decision by the court was notprevented by them. In the statements I have made so far, I have pointedout that the limiting regulations of the NN procedure did not exert anegative influence for the defendant in the proceeding.Keeping the prisoners incommunicado had been ordered by the Fuehrerorder and by the military authorities. The question of militarynecessity was not subject to review by us. International law puts thesemilitary interests above the personal interests of the inhabitants ofthe occupied territories.From all these considerations I did not see that the NN regulationswere contrary to international law.Q. Since the prosecution has submitted documents about the conditionsin concentration camps against all defendants who continued working inthe Ministry of Justice after 1942, I have to ask you too what you knewabout occurrences in concentration camps.A. My various official positions could not afford me any knowledgeabout such events. Even at the time when members of the SS did not yethave their independent jurisdiction, when reports about these excessesin concentration camps could thus still reach the Ministry of Justice,my section was not affected by this, and this was entirely regardlessof the fact that these reports only provided knowledge of a very smallsection of actual conditions.In conversations, too, within the Ministry I heard very little aboutthese matters, probably because they were treated as secret, and I wasnot in a special confidential relationship with the Referenten whowere working on these matters. For those reasons, for example, theoccurrences in the Kemna and Hohenstein camps being known to me onlyhere during this trial. I myself never visited a concentration camp.As far as private knowledge is concerned, I considered being kept inthe concentration camp, of course, as something unpleasant, especiallysince the camps were cut off from the outside world, the uncertaintyof the period of detention, the lack of orderly legal recourse.That abuses might have occurred for those reasons I assumed withoutknowing anything definite about it. I did not have acquaintances whohad been in a concentration camp and from whom I might have found outsome definite details. Although I had quite good relationships withProtestant church circles, for example, I did not even know, did notgain any definite knowledge about Niemoellers[491] being kept in aconcentration camp. About systematic killings and mass exterminations Iheard only after the surrender.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *_CROSS-EXAMINATION_MR. WOOLEYHAN: Mr. von Ammon, last Friday you stated withregard to your relationship with the Nazi Party that you were a victimof Nazi propaganda and that you were not an enthusiastic Party memberfor ideological reasons. Werent you omitting some very importantevents in your political career?DEFENDANT VON AMMON: First of all, I believe that I did notexpress myself in that cross manner, that I described myself as avictim of Nazi propaganda. I only stated that under the influence ofNazi propaganda I saw many a thing in a more favorable light than itactually was, and that I was not an enthusiastic National Socialist,because from my ideological point of view, much kept me apart from theParty. I am not aware of the fact that I left out anything importantwhen making such a statement.Q. Then you dont consider it important, noteworthy enough to remember,that on 9 November 1923 you actively participated with Hitler andothers in the famous Munich Putsch; why dont you remember that, Dr.von Ammon?A. Of course, I remember that, but it is not correct that I left theseevents out, rather I stated that as a high school student as well asa college student I belonged to patriotic youth organizations and toNationalists associations. Among these Nationalists associationsalso belonged the Bund Oberland, which actually, as you indicated,participated in the so-called Hitler Putsch of 9 November 1923.Q. As a result of that Putsch in which you participated, wasnt Hitlertried and imprisoned for high treason, for trying to overthrow theGerman Republic by force?A. Yes.Q. Were you tried, Dr. von Ammon?A. No.Q. Why not?A. Because my participation in the Hitler Putsch was so insignificant.By the way, my participation wasnt at that time even found out bythe authorities, as was the case with the great majority of those whoparticipated.Q. If your participation and membership in the Nazi activity at thattime had become known, you would have lost your job in the government,wouldnt you, or did you have a job at that time?A. No, certainly not. First, I was still a college student at thattime, as I stated before, and also I do not believe I would have lostmy job. Many participants that is, many civil servants who participatedat least, if they took part in a subordinate role such as I were not inany way affected in their positions. Moreover, I would like to state atthat time it was not a Nazi activity within the meaning of that phrase,the Bund Oberland was not a National Socialist organization. It was apatriotic, self-protective organization, which in the years after theFirst World War in the fight against the attempted Communist uprisingand in the fight against the Polish uprising in Upper Silesia in 1921,without a doubt had gained its merits. To be sure, I participated inthe Hitler Putsch at that time, but at that time the fronts were notso well delineated as yet that the actual Putsch could be described asunequivocal Nazi action.Q. If that is so, Dr. von Ammon, apparently officials in the Ministryof Justice were not aware of it really, because as I read your officialpersonnel files here which came from the Ministry, and which I am sureyou have seen many times with respect to your membership in the earlypolitical associations, you are credited with having participated, andI am quoting, in the Nazi uprising in Munich on 9 November 1923.Now, in later years, Dr. von Ammon, did the Nazi Party ever give youany tangible momento of that famous event of 1923?A. First of all, in order to correct you, I would like to say thatI never saw my personnel files, as you assume, Mr. Prosecutor. I donot know at all what is written in these personnel files. As faras the question is concerned whether I have a tangible momento ofmy participation in the Hitler Putsch, I have to answer that thismomento was limited to a pass which permitted me to participate in thefestivities which took place yearly on 8 and 9 November in Munich--Q. Ah--A. And I may also add that I only seldom made use of this pass.Q. What number was that card or pass?A. Unfortunately I dont recall.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *Q. Now, Dr. von Ammon, there is just one thing further in thiscustody-of-the-Gestapo business that confuses me. After the arrangementhad been made late in 1944 to transfer these Nacht und Nebel prisonersto the Gestapo for protective custody, there has been a lot of talkhere about the fact that the court authorities finally handed thesepeople over to the Gestapo, at least in some measure.What actually was involved in this handing over of Nacht und Nebelprisoners to the Gestapo as far as the courts and the justiceadministration were concerned? By handing over, what actually didhappen, so far as the courts and the Ministry are concerned? Did yousign a release? Did you actually put them in trucks and take them tothe other side of town, or what happened?A. Unfortunately I cannot give you that information. You have to turnto the Referent of the department for penal administration, to thewitness Hecker,[492] who carried out those transfers.Q. Dr. von Ammon, with respect to the winding up of the Nacht und Nebelaffairs in the Ministry in the handing over of these people to theGestapo, the witness Hecker in Exhibit 416[493] says that you attendeda number of the conferences during which this method was ironed out.Its surprising that you dont know how it happened. How did thesepeople get off your hands? Was it a paper transfer, or what was it?A. No, two ordinances of Departments IV and V were issued at that time,and they were issued to the chief general prosecutors concerned, tothe effect that they were to transfer the prisoners to the competentauthority, the Gestapo.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *Q. You mentioned that the courts in enforcing the Nacht und Nebelprogram by trying Nacht und Nebel defendants, particularly the SpecialCourts, had been moderate in their sentences. Now, in view of that,Im wondering if that is true for the reason that after the Nacht undNebel program was terminated by these arrangements in 1944, you wrotea letter to the Attorney General in Munich and you told the AttorneyGeneral in Munich that in view of the new arrangement concerning thetreatment of Nacht und Nebel prisoners in the future, namely theirtransfer to the Gestapo, There no longer will be executions of Nachtund Nebel prisoners in any large numbers.[494] Now, tell me, Dr. vonAmmon, if these courts were so lenient and gentle with these Nacht undNebel defendants, why did you see fit to mention that death sentenceswerent going to be in any large numbers in the future? Thats the sameas saying they were large in the past, isnt it?A. I stressed above all that the sentences passed by the Special Courtswere moderate. It is true that the Special Courts only passed a fewdeath sentences. I did say, however, on the contrary that the PeoplesCourt did pass a large number of death sentences and even mentionedthat 50 percent of the persons indicted by the Peoples Court weresentenced to death. Those sentences which were intended to be executedin Munich were sentences which had been passed by the Peoples Court.Q. In any event, whether it was the Peoples Court or the SpecialCourt, after that Nacht und Nebel program was dissolved, you were ofthe opinion then that large numbers of death sentences would not bepassed in the future?A. No, actually I was of the opinion that no further death sentenceswould be passed. The only thing that could still happen was that deathsentences would be executed that had been passed prior to September1944.Q. And from your letter, it appears that up until that time, they hadbeen large in number, does it not?A. Well, that is a relative concept--that word large.Q. Oh, of course.A. I believe that in view of the long period of time--from 1942 untilthe end of 1944--the number of death sentences which were actuallypassed is relatively small.Q. May it please the court, the prosecution offers as Document NG-1886,Prosecution Exhibit 546, the letter written by defendant von Ammonwhich we have just been discussing.PRESIDING JUDGE BRAND: The exhibit is received.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *_EXAMINATION BY THE TRIBUNAL_PRESIDING JUDGE BRAND: I understood you to say that you didnot know of any innocent person who was brought to Germany under Nachtund Nebel procedure.DEFENDANT VON AMMON: I was referring to the assertion of theprosecution. The prosecution had maintained that evidently innocentpersons had been treated in exactly the same manner as guilty NNprisoners, and it was in reply to that, that I stated that evidentlyinnocent persons were never brought to Germany at all; that is to say,as far as my knowledge goes. If, however, it did happen that a personwas evidently innocent and had been brought to Germany, then there wasa possibility of releasing him back to the occupied territories.Q. I still understand you to say that you knew of no innocent personbrought under Nacht und Nebel procedure.A. It may have happened, naturally, but--Q. I am referring to what you said. Did I correctly understand you tomake the statement that you knew of no innocent person who was broughtto Germany under Nacht und Nebel procedure?A. I would like to restrict that to evidently innocent persons, asopposed to a person whose innocence only later was made clear. Thatnaturally happened, too, and such cases did occur and such cases werebrought to Germany.Q. That is a very material modification of your former statement,because you also said that considerable numbers were acquitted. Iassume that you do not consider that persons who were acquitted werenecessarily guilty; you presume them innocent if they were acquitted,dont you?A. Or that the evidence was not sufficient to prove them guilty.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *_REDIRECT EXAMINATION_DR. KUBUSCHOK: In reply to a question by the prosecutor,you spoke of your membership with the Bund Oberland, and you statedthat the Bund Oberland on 8 November [9 November] 1923 took partin the so-called Hitler Putsch. You stated that the Bund Oberlandwas an association--a so-called Nationalistic association of whichmany members were college students. Did that organization Oberlandat a later time ever become incorporated in the NSDAP? Did thatnationalistic organization ever become a National Socialist unit by wayof incorporation?DEFENDANT VON AMMON: No. After the Bund Oberland hadparticipated in the Hitler Putsch on 9 November, it was dissolved.I believe that at some time later on it came back to life, but Ipersonally no longer took any part in it. As far as I know, it never inany way was incorporated in the National Socialist movement.Q. How far did you participate in the events of the night of 9 November1923?A. The company of the Bund Oberland to which I had been assigned wasalerted, on the evening of 8 November 1923. I was not alerted becausemy name was not on the alert list. I had joined the Bund Oberland onlya little before that time. Therefore, I was only told about it on themorning of the 9th. I then joined my company which was stationed in aninn by the Isar, at Bogenhausen, in Munich. There I spent a few hourswith the company; then we marched off to the East.

Breach of Work Contracts and Unauthorized Change of                       Residence of Foreigners_1. In my last situation report I already pointed out the difficultieswhich are created by the criminal prosecution of foreigners, especiallyPolish civilian workers, who leave their place of work and theirassigned place of residence without authorization.The directors of the labor offices and the Reich Trustee for Laborof the economic territory of Westphalia-Lower Rhine as a rule do notprefer the necessary charges for criminal prosecution, in accordancewith the decree concerning the restrictions for changing the place ofwork, dated 1 September 1939--Reich Law Gazette I, page 1685--and inaccordance with the decree concerning the fixing of wages, dated 25June 1938--Reich Law Gazette I, page 691.Upon inquiry, the Reich Trustee for Labor for the economic territoryof Westphalia-Lower Rhine has informed me that in accordance with anagreement between the Reich Minister for Labor and the Reich Leader SSand Chief of the German Police, breach of work contracts by Poles areto be punished by the Secret State Police with protective custody orconcentration camps. The meaning of this step--so writes this Reichtrustee--is that in the case of Poles the strictest measures are to betaken at once in order to create a deterrent effect. For this reasonwe made it a point in my office to transfer the cases involving breachof work contract by Polish civilian workers to the Gestapo (SecretState Police) for further action. Only in those cases where the Polishworkers involved were already under arrest on charges of vagrancy,vagabonding, etc., and investigated, have I in those cases known tome, preferred charges for breach of work contract, so that all thepunishable offenses of the Pole could be adjudicated in _one_court trial.In one individual case, concerning a member of Protectorate, the ReichLabor Trustee for the economic districts of Westphalia and Lower-Rhinerefrained from demanding legal action stating, as a reason, that allforeigners including the Czechs were exempt from criminal action wherethis question is concerned.Contrary to the opinion of the above-named authority, the ReichTrustee for Public Service, who had been informed of the attitudefundamentally taken by the Reich Labor Trustee for the economicdistricts of Westphalia and Lower-Rhine, has strictly upheld thecharges he had preferred against members of the Protectorate whohad broken their contracts. In the case in question, the demand forpunitive action was based upon the recommendation of the Reich Ministerfor Transportation to the Reich Trustee for Public Service, dated 24June 1940 and 13 August 1940 respectively--51.533 Pldaa. Accordingto a statement by the Reich Trustee of Public Service, entered intothe criminal record files, the Reich Minister of Labor stated at thattime in reply to the report of the Reich Trustee for Public Servicereferring to a regulation dated 17 July 1940--III b 15062/40, that hehad no objections, if he--the Reich Trustee--should prefer charges inaccordance with the wishes of the Reich Minister of Transportation. Onthe other hand the competent office of the Reich Protector thinks itmore advisable, not to punish workers from the Protectorate employedwithin the Reich proper for breach of work contract or to punish themonly very mildly as otherwise great difficulties would be encounteredin the further recruitment of Czech workers from the Protectoratefor jobs in the Reich proper. At any rate, I have dealt with thecriminal procedure against workers from the Protectorate for breachof work contract in a special report to the Protectorate also takingup the question concerning the competence of the German courts inthe Protectorate for passing sentence in case of breach of contract,committed in the Reich proper.According to this there seems to be a difference of opinion within theReich Ministry of Labor as to the question in which cases the competentauthorities should prefer charges against foreigners who have brokentheir contracts. In order to get uniform action on matters concerningpunitive regulations it seems desirable to have the Reich Minister ofLabor effect a settlement that negotiations between the Ministriesconcerned and the Reich Protector will result in an agreement tofollow one standard rule in preferring charges against members of theProtectorate.Polish civilian workers leaving their working place _and_ theirplace of residence without permission have at times--when no chargeshad been preferred against them--been prosecuted and punished accordingto the viewpoint of article 2 of the ordinance [VO], concerning thetreatment of foreigners of 5 September 1939--Reich Law Gazette I,page 1667. This procedure is not without objection, because the Polesconcerned were not in the Reich proper on 6 September 1939 when thisdecree took effect, and it is not known whether they had been informedof this regulation according to article 1 of the ordinance._VI. Criminal Proceedings against Zivilpolen [Polish Civilians]_[495]With regard to criminal proceedings against the so-calledZivilpolen--as has been pointed out by me before--an uncertaintyhas developed which can no longer be tolerated. One cause for theuncertainty regarding criminal proceedings is found in the fact thatsome matters are handled by the State police independently, and theother is that sentences passed by the regular courts are not basedon uniform standards. It may happen that the regular court maysentence a criminal to 2 to 3 years of imprisonment--concurrently orseparately--while the State police may pronounce the death sentencefor the same crime. In order to overcome these intolerable conditionsI have issued directives to the senior public prosecutors and to thepublic prosecutors of the district and have therein called attention tothe following aspects:Civilian Poles are under the jurisdiction of the regular courts becauseno special provisions are made for them. However, it is not sufficient,firmly to advocate this principle, but the real effect of jurisdictioncan only be secured by consequent and energetic _action_ accordingto this principle, and by administering justice with the speed andseverity called for by the situation. In this way it was made possiblein the criminal case Bugajny (IIIg 23 5023/40) for the regularjurisdiction to become effective and to do justice to the case. TheState police had decided not to hand the case over to the office ofthe public prosecutor and, with the objective of having the Statepolice deal with the case, reported it to the Security Main Office. Ilearned about this case from a newspaper report, and I asked the seniorpublic prosecutor to procure a legal warrant of arrest, to put theaccused into a court prison, and then through investigations of hisown to ascertain the facts of the case, and to prefer charges as soonas possible. The Pole was thereupon condemned to death for criminalviolence and forthwith executed without intervention of the Statepolice.The result obtained in this case must, however, not mislead us, andmake us forget that as a rule successful action depends on two otherconditions.For one thing, it is necessary that the office of the public prosecutorbe notified immediately. One cannot depend on the chance that anewspaper will report a case. It must be made sure, therefore, that thelocal police will immediately report crimes committed by civilian Polesto the office of the public prosecutor.The other thing is the question of the measure of punishment. Accordingto article 1 of the GewVVO[496] the death sentence was called for inthe criminal case Bugajny. But what punishment should be given, e.g.,for indecent assault--cases in which the State police generally alsopass the death sentence. The question is whether Zivilpolen shouldon principle be judged according to article 4, VVO[497] when in theindividual case special circumstances according to article 4, VVO donot exist.In my opinion this question may be answered with yes, if (1) politicalcrimes or, (2) crimes against the body, life, or possession of a Germanare involved. The term body, life, or possession is taken fromarticle 2 of the VVO and it is, therefore, to receive an accordinglyfree interpretation. It would not apply, e.g., to refusal to work, andalso not to any crimes of the Zivilpolen among themselves.The following points should lend support to--(1) That Poles are citizens of an enemy state, whose representatives inforeign countries are continuing to fight against Germany.(2) That they are citizens of a nation which contrary to allinternational laws has massacred 60,000 German civilians and mistreatedand plundered others.Therefore, this is not a question simply of malicious crimes, worksabotage, or indecent assault, etc., but crimes which due to the factthat they were committed by Poles against the German Reich or againsta German fellow countryman considering the type of Polish warfare (see(1) and (2) above) appear in a different light.Of _this type_ of crime it can, in my opinion, be said that itwas committed by taking advantage of war conditions and is thereforeespecially contemptible. For the Zivilpolen have only come to Germanyproper because of the war conditions (insufficient work in Poland,lack of workers in Germany). Here they are due to the war situation(drafting of fathers, shortage of other personnel) without sufficientsupervision, in the midst of German nationals especially women andchildren, and in German factories as well as in other establishments ofgreat importance to the German armed forces.The Zivilpole too is without doubt aware of all these circumstances.These circumstances have not necessarily been the actual reasons forthis action. But often this will be the case with the stirred up Polishnational hatred.Of course it is not quite certain whether the courts, especially thosecourts which until now have punished the crimes committed by Zivilpolenvery moderately or even mildly, will agree with this legal conceptionand, if the occasion arises, will pronounce the death sentence incase of an especially serious crime. However, this question does notseem hopeless to me, if the Ministry will exert its influence throughcirculars, articles in the Deutsche Justiz, or in oral discussions.I think that a special directive stressing the importance of such anadministration of justice in the interest of safeguarding a normalcourse of jurisdiction, would also bring results. According to ourexperience so far, it should generally be possible to avoid theapplication of Article 4, VVO in cases of _Polish females_.

The Poles carried out thesemeasures against the ethnic Germans in a manner which the Germansconsidered to be absolutely arbitrary, contrary to international law,and brutal (cf. for instance, Freisler, Development of the nationalitylaw of ethnic German groups, in _German Justice_, 1941, pp. 881ff.).As far as _Reich Germans_, who in exceptional cases were notprohibited from participating in the above-mentioned ethnic Germanorganizations, are concerned by this, article 91, paragraph 2 of GermanPenal Code, is to be taken into consideration.As far as _ethnic Germans_ are concerned, paragraph 91, section2 of German Penal Code, is not directly applicable, as ethnic Germansaccording to formal national law were not German, but Polish citizens.I can only express my opinion in the _form of a suggestion_,that in the case of the betrayal of ethnic Germans to the foreignpolice, article 91, paragraph 2 of German Penal Code is to be appliedaccordingly on the basis of article 2 of German Penal Code (videPeoples Court 2d Senate of 19 May 1938, _vs._ Wenzel Krippner,document number 14 J 785/37-2 H 22/38; different opinion: PeoplesCourt 3d Senate of 14 June 1938, _vs._ Walter Zueckert, documentnumber 7 J 105/378-3 L 78/37; decision of 24 October 1940 to quashcriminal proceedings in the criminal case, _vs._ Anton Reiprich,document number 4 J 86/40g).An offender who has caused, or who wanted to cause ethnic Germans tobe punished or otherwise prosecuted by Polish (Czech, or Lithuanian)authorities was hitherto almost never punished, because in suchcases the intention, according to articles 88, 89, and 90c of theGerman Penal Code, i.e., the knowledge that he had acted against theinterests of the _Reich_ could not be proved satisfactorilyowing to a lack of comprehensive political training and of judgment,article 91, paragraph 2 of the German Penal Code, was considered tobe nonapplicable.[498] Such an offender deserves a much heavierpunishment, for his dishonorable behavior--behavior which up to nowhas generally been considered as contemptible in judicial decisionand conclusions made by public prosecutors--than, for instance, aperson who only apparently was connected with a foreign intelligenceservice for purposes of treason, but who must be punished according toArticle 90c of German Penal Code. The offender nearly always knew thatGermans were concerned.Even considering the possibility that a decision, according to article91, paragraph 2 of German Penal Code, falls into the hands of a foreigngovernment, it would not cause additional attacks against the Reichin foreign affairs, if this decision contains a complete explanation.Such a legal standpoint neither demands the ethnic Germans livingon the former borders of the Reich to behave disloyally toward theforeign nation, nor does it take away from the foreign nation the rightto exercise a normal police control over the ethnic Germans. Thiscorresponding application according to the above always provides thatforeign police control served purposes and measures contradictory tointernational law and law of minorities. This is especially applicableto the border districts which were taken from the Reich, according tothe Treaty of Versailles. Nor does this opinion, for instance, objectif single members or groups of ethnic German organizations now and thenshould have overstepped the bounds of loyalty, for this was not thecause, but the _consequence_ of foreign compulsory measures.I would consider as improper only the laying down generally and legallyof a treatment applicable to treason committed by ethnic Germans, byadding a supplementary regulation to the second paragraph of article91 of the Penal Code. It is true that consideration regarding foreignpolicy would oppose this. But on the other hand, in my opinion, thelack of an express regulation of penal law for the protection of ethnicGermans does not prove that article 91, paragraph 2, of the criminalcode should be applied in every case. On the contrary, I considerthis to be a task for the courts to fill a gap in the law, which hasbeen left open for state political reasons, by creating a law in theappropriate cases.The basic idea of article 91, paragraph 2 has been expressed as followsin the verdict of the Peoples Court 4th Senate of 8 April 1940,against Horst Moses (4 L 2/40):   The National Socialist State is especially well aware of its   responsibility toward its citizens, and of its duty to protect   all its members, especially if they are abroad and do not enjoy   the full protection of law. Hence, it feels its integrity   endangered, even in the case of a conspiracy by a foreign   government against a single Reich citizen, and wants to lend   the threatened person its legal protection, as far as this is   possible, from the home country.The Reich made no secret of the fact that with regard to the protectionof Germans it does not only claim the right to protect Reich Germans,but also ethnic Germans living on its borders. The Reichstag speechmade by the Fuehrer on 20 February 1938, strikes me as fundamental,even if it was directed especially against the then CzechoslovakianRepublic. In this speech, he pointed out, among other things:--   * * * two of the states situated on our frontiers alone have   more than ten million Germans * * *.   The fact that [these persons] were separated from the Reich   by constitutional law, cannot deprive [them] of their ethnic   political rights (volkspolitische Rechtlosmachung); i.e.,   the general rights of an ethnic self-determination which,   incidentally, were solemnly granted to us as prerequisites of   the armistice in Wilsons Fourteen Points. These rights cannot   be disregarded simply because Germans are concerned! In the   long run it is impossible for a world power with self-respect   to know that they have ethnic comrades [Volksgenossen] at their   side who, owing to their sympathy or their ties with the whole   population [Gesamtvolk], its fate, and its ideology, are being   continually, and gravely harmed. The fact that it is possible,   if there is good will, to find ways to reach compromise   [Ausgleich] or to ease this suffering, has been proved. But he   who tries to prevent such easing in Europe by force will one day   invite force among the nations.   For it cannot be denied, that as long as Germany was powerless   and defenseless, she had simply to tolerate the fact that there   was a continual persecution of German people on our frontiers.   But in the same way as England represents her interests over the   whole world, the Germany of today will know how to represent   and to protect her interests, even if they are more limited.   And these interests of the German people comprise also the   protection of those Germans who, of their own accord, are not   in a position to ensure for themselves along our frontiers the   right of commonly human, political, and ideological independence   * * *. [End of quote from Hitlers speech.]I request, therefore, the re-examination of this question on account ofits fundamental importance in regard to legislation and to clarify itsprinciple--in the first place, for the jurisdiction of the Chief ReichProsecutor at the Peoples Court--so that this question may throughindictments in the respective cases, also be decided in court. It is,of course, not intended by these statements to anticipate the weighingof evidence in the present case.   * * * I induced the Foreign Office to participate in the   afore-mentioned expert opinion. The Foreign Office did not make   any particular comment on the statements concerning purely legal   matters, but has pointed out that questions in the sphere of   _foreign politics_ could not be raised, if the court in   cases such as the present, acted in accordance with article   91, paragraph 2 of the Penal Code for the above-mentioned   reasons. This comment applies firstly to such cases in which   the ethnic groups of former Poland, Lithuania, as well as the   former Czechoslovakia, and Soviet Russia are concerned. In cases   in which other countries are involved, the question would, if   necessary, have to be examined individually. [End of Himmlers   letter.]The president of the Peoples Court, to whom I applied for a commenton this judicial problem, in view of the above-mentioned two differentverdicts, has stated:   A discussion with the presidents and the deputy presidents of   the senates of the Peoples Court on the legal question, whether   article 91, paragraph 2 of the Penal Code may be applied in   connection with article 2 of the Penal Code[499] in connection   with the protection of ethnic Germans of foreign nationality,   resulted in the following unanimous interpretation:   The application is confirmed--   (1) if the wrong [Unrechtsgehalt] of the act--apart from the   requirements that all other necessary constitutive elements   [of the crime] must be present--is so serious as absolutely to   demand punishment,   (2) if the granting of equal rights to an ethnic German and to   a German national does not present for the state to which the   ethnic German belongs, a grave detrimental proposition from a   political point of view, which is prejudicial to its sovereignty   and to its friendly relations with the Reich,   (3) if the act is not subject to punishment from any other legal   point of view according to German penal law nor subject to   punishment according to the laws of the foreign state (article 4   of the Penal Code).I agree firstly with the Reich Leader SS and the President of thePeoples Court that a direct application of article 91, paragraph 2 ofthe Penal Code, which obviously, expressly, and knowingly--see alsothe draft of the new penal code--protects only German nationals willnot be made in favor of ethnic Germans. Furthermore, I concur with theconception that the general political development which has meanwhilecome about, particularly during the last years, enabling the Reichlargely to protect its ethnic members of foreign nationality to agreater extent than has been possible hitherto must be borne in mind inthis particular instance. Therefore, I find it necessary on principleto protect by means of the German Penal Code those ethnic Germans whohave seriously suffered through action such as mentioned in article 91,paragraph 2 of the Penal Code, provided that the action, in accordancewith sound public sentiment, deserves punishment analogous to thisprovision, but where such punishment considering the wrong of theparticular case cannot be pronounced on account of any other directlyapplicable penal regulation. In this connection, my standpoint--andthis agrees with Laemmle, German Justice, 1940, page 775, and withthe practice of the Peoples Court mentioned therein--is that the actwhich is punishable according to article 91, paragraph 2 of the PenalCode must be considered as an act of high treason against the Reichto which article 4, paragraph 3, number 2, of the Penal Code, notarticle 4, paragraph 2, is applicable. Whether in other respects theprerequisites for an appropriate application of article 91, paragraph2, in conjunction with article 2 of the German Penal Code exist, will,in my opinion, depend upon the examination of each individual case, inwhich also questions of foreign politics will have to be taken intoconsideration, although these already have been eliminated to a largeextent by the comment of the Foreign Office contained in the expertopinion of the Reich Leader SS.In this connection, I wish to quote, by way of example, two cases ofpreliminary proceedings which have recently come to my hands, and whichconcern particularly serious aspects.In the proceedings of 3 J 304/41 _vs._ Hellig, the defendant, anethnic German, formerly resident in Northern Bukovina, and formerly ofRumanian nationality, who since became a German national, repeatedlyguided, for high reward, ethnic Germans of Rumanian nationality, whohad been surprised by the Russian occupation of Northern Bukovina bythe Soviet Russians in 1940, allegedly in order to enable them toillegally pass the frontier into Rumania, but then played them into thehands of the Russian frontier guards.In the proceeding 11 J 8/42 g _vs._ Golek, the defendant, a formerPolish national, of the Polish ethnic group, in the years of 1938 and1939 in Poland handed over to the Polish authorities his friend, theethnic German Leo Hardt, of Polish nationality, by accusing him wronglyof treason in favor of the Reich and by concealing in the lattershouse a Polish army regulation book for the purpose of incriminatinghim. As a result of this action of Golek, Hardt was condemned to 6years of imprisonment for espionage in favor of Germany.In the majority of the cases, as in the two cases cited, it willbe offenses, which have been committed by foreign nationals abroadagainst ethnic Germans. To that effect I shall have to report in eachindividual case especially for the purpose of reaching the decision oninitiating prosecution according to article 153a, paragraph 2, Code ofCriminal Procedure, so that the doubtful problems mentioned above willhave to be decided upon there in each case. There are cases possible,however, in which the offender acted also or only within Germany properso that a report is practically unnecessary. In view of this and onaccount of the fundamental importance of this problem, I believed, Ishould submit it in general already at this time with the request for a_decision_, as to whether my _interpretation is approved_.

FINDINGSThe accused who is a Pole and who on 1 September 1939 was resident atKajscowka in the district of Myslenice in Poland was employed as anagricultural laborer by the farmer Therese Schwenzl at Bodenhof in theparish of Muehlen. In the beginning of February 1942, Mrs. Schwenzltogether with the accused and a Polish maid were cutting chaff. Theaccused stood to the right of the chaff-cutting machine. Without sayinganything he suddenly touched Mrs. Schwenzls genitals through herdress. When thereupon she said: You swine, you think nothing terrifiesme. You think you can do that to me because my husband is sick. Theaccused just laughed and repeated his action. At this Mrs. Schwenzlslapped his face. In spite of this he did it again. Finally, he had aquarrel with the Polish maid and did no longer molest the farmers wife.On 8 February 1942, the accused left his place of employment withoutpermission and was arrested on 9 February 1942 when calling at theemployment exchange at Neumarkt/Oberpfalz.The circumstances are proved by the absolutely trustworthy statementgiven by the witness Mrs. Schwenzl under oath. The stubborn denial ofthe accused is disproved by statements made by the witness.In the witness Schwenzls description there is nothing to prove thatthe accused went as far as to use force against the witness. Therefore,this is no case of sexual crime according to article 176, paragraph(1), Penal Code, but only a case of personal assault according toarticle 185, Penal Code.No sentence has been proposed pursuant to article 2 of the decreeconcerning wages of 25 June 1938. The fact is that the accused lefthis place of employment and cannot be punished under articles 2 and 8of the ordinance, dated 5 September 1939, Reichsgesetzblatt I, page1667, dealing with the treatment of foreigners, since it has not beenestablished that the accused had left the place where he stayed atthe time of a public summons in accordance with section 1 of the sameordinance. However, articles 1a and 9 of the police decree of theRegierungspraesident [president of local government] of Regensburgdealing with the treatment of Polish labor should be applied.According to this, the accused has been proved to have assaultedanother person and to have violated the police orders regarding thetreatment of Polish labor by another action. He therefore is to bepunished for personal assault according to article 185, Penal Code,together with a violation of articles 1 and 9 of the police decree ofthe Regierungspraesident of Regensburg, dated 28 May 1940 No. 1032 f.47, supplemented by the ordinance dated 23 December 1941 No. 1032 f.48 and dated 3 June 1941 No. 1032 f. 27 in conjunction with articlesIII and XIV of the Criminal Code for Poles dated 4 December 1941,Reichsgesetzblatt I, page 759.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *Although the accused was treated well in Schwenzls house, he was aslazy as he was insolent and presumptuous. The manner in which theaccused committed this act of insult to the honor of his employer [Mrs.Schwenzl] shows an enormous degree of insolence and shamelessnesswhich can be found only among persons belonging to the Polish people.The fact that the husband Schwenzl was ill in bed at the time thecrime was committed has an aggravating effect. It demonstrates themean and treacherous character of the accused that he did not findit convenient to confess but denied it all stubbornly. He stubbornlycontinued his denial even in the face of the sworn statements of thewitness Schwenzl. It therefore seems appropriate to sentence theaccused to 2 years imprisonment at a detention camp in application ofarticles III and XIV of the Penal Code for Poles dated 4 December 1941,Reichsgesetzblatt I, page 759. For the unauthorized leaving of hisplace of residence the usual fine of 35 RM or 1 week of detention campwas considered to be an appropriate punishment.Costs--Article 465, Code of Criminal Procedure.--There is no cause totake into account the time spent in arrest pending trial in view of themean conduct shown by the defendant, article 60, Penal Code.

In this connectionthe case will be returned to the lower court, _namely to the SpecialCourt at Nuernberg_, for a new trial and sentence.                               FINDINGSBy the afore-mentioned verdict the accused has been sentenced to 2years at a detention camp for personal assault according to article185, Penal Code, in conjunction with articles III and XIV of theCriminal Code for Poles dated 4 December 1941, Reichsgesetzblatt I,page 759. The sentence has been declared valid.The Chief Reich Prosecutor has filed a nullity plea and has moved toannul the sentence by decision and to return the case to the lowerinstance, namely the Special Court at Nuernberg for a new trial andsentence. The motion has been granted.The sentence passed by the local court is defective in law insofaras it does not discuss at all as to whether article 4 of the decreeagainst public enemies of 5 September 1939[502] (ReichsgesetzblattI, p. 1679) is applicable. That this is applicable may very well beassumed considering the facts established. According to these factsthe possibility exists that the defendant knowingly took advantage ofthe wartime conditions when committing the crime, inasmuch as he wasaided by the lack of other labor and a thereby conditioned insufficientsupervision and watching, or inasmuch as he presumed that because ofthe labor shortage no charges would be preferred against him lest notto lose a hand. In the summary of the local court as to the sentenceimposed it has been emphasized that the action of the defendant provedan unheard of amount of impudence. This impudence, considering thefacts, could possibly be explained only by the fact that the defendantconsidered himself indispensable, and therefore presumed he did nothave to reckon with the preferring of charges.With this judicial error the judgment has become unjust since, if alsoarticle 4 of the decree against public enemies is applicable which mayvery well be assumed, a much more severe sentence is deemed necessary.

Thesentence was pronounced in open session on 26 October 1942. Personspresent were--    The Presiding Judge: President of the District Court Chamber                         Dr. Rothaug.    The Associate Judges: District Court Judge Dr. Ferber and                          Local Court Judge Dr. Pfaff.    The Prosecutor at the Special Court: Senior Public Prosecutor                          Paulus.    Chief clerk Kastner as registrar of the office.Lopata, Jan, born on 24 June 1916 in Kajscowka, single, Polishagricultural worker, last place of residence Bodenhof, in arrestpending trial for this case is, by application of articles II, III,and XIV of the decree concerning Poles and Jews, sentenced to deathfor a crime under section 4 of the decree against public enemies inconnection with assault, and will have to bear the costs.                              _FINDINGS_1. The accused is a Pole; he belongs to the Polish ethnic group. Hegrew up in Kajscowka as son of a farmer and cattle dealer, he attendedschool for 6 years according to local custom. He can read, calculate,and write. According to his testimony, the parents of the accused diedover 20 years ago. A brother and a sister of the accused live in theGovernment General. After he left school--in 1931--the accused workedon a farm for his aunt because his parents had died. At the age of20--in 1937--the defendant took up work as a farm hand.2. After reporting voluntarily, in spring of 1940, the defendant wasassigned by the labor office Neumarkt/Oberpfalz to work for the farmerJosef Schwenzl in Bodenhof, district Neumarkt/Oberpfalz. Early February1942--on a day which can no longer be clearly specified--the wife ofthe farmer Schwenzl, together with the accused and a Polish girl werecutting chaff in the barn. The accused was standing on the right handside of the machine to carry out the work. Suddenly while working, theaccused without saying anything, touched with his hand the genitalsof farmer Schwenzls wife through her dress. When she said after thisunexpected action of the defendant, You swine, you think nothingterrifies me, you think you can do that because my husband is sick,the accused laughed and, in spite of this admonition, again touched thegenitals of the farmers wife through her dress. The wife of farmerSchwenzl slapped his face after that. In spite of this, the accusedcontinued with his aggressive conduct, for a third time he touched thegenitals of the farmers wife through her dress.On account of that the farmers wife started a heated quarrel with theaccused. The accused started to quarrel with the Polish maid too, andno longer molested the farmers wife.                                  IIThe accused did not make a complete confession. He states that he onlyonce, for fun, touched the genitals of the farmers wife through herdress.The court is convinced, on account of the testimony given by thewitness Therese Schwenzl, who makes a trustworthy impression, that theincident occurred exactly as described by the witness. Therefore, thecourt based its findings on the testimony given by this witness.The prohibition to have sexual intercourse with a German woman wasknown to the accused, he also knew about the severe punishments laiddown for Poles who do not comply with this regulation. When the accusedwas assigned a place of work by the labor office Neumarkt/Oberpfalz inspring 1940, this regulation was pointed out to him according to thetestimony of the witness Reiser; he was also given a printed guide ofconduct for enlightenment. The statement of the accused that, in spiteof all, he had no knowledge of this regulation because when given theinstruction no interpreter was present, and because he did not perusethe guide of conduct, proves to be a scant excuse; because when askedwhy he denied having been aggressive towards the farmers wife in hisinterrogation by the local court at Neumarkt, a fact which can beproved on hand of the record made there on 28 April 1942, the accusedsays that he did not want to confess, not even partially, fearing thatthe death sentence would be pronounced.Thus, the defendant gives the impression of a definitely degeneratepersonality who is distinguished by irritability and a positivepropensity to lying; all his inferiority is based on his characterand the reason can obviously be found in his belonging to the Polishsubhuman race.                                  IIIThe established facts show first of all that the defendant grosslyassaulted the honor of farmer Schwenzls wife by his frequentlytouching her genitals. The defendant fully realized the despicablenature of his mean and base aggressive conduct. He thereby committedthe offense of personal assault--article 185, Penal Code, 13 March1942. The insulted person preferred charges in writing on account ofthe personal assault.This, however, does not cover the full extent of the defendants crime.The drafting of men into the armed forces effected a serious laborshortage in all spheres of life at home, last but not least inagriculture. To balance this, Polish laborers, among others, had tobe used to a large extent in the Reich, mainly as farm hands. Thesemen cannot be supervised by the authorities to such an extent as theirinsubordinate and criminal disposition would necessitate. Since thereis a lack of the necessary supervision, these Poles are becomingimpudent and insubordinate. At the same time, they know that they canindulge in all manner of activities, because we have to depend on them,and because it is difficult to find replacements.The defendant has lived in the greater German domestic sphere for asufficient length of time to know about these circumstances caused bythe war as he saw them daily with his own eyes.From the very beginning of his employment with Schwenzl the defendantwas a lazy and stubborn fellow. Frequently he refused to work; whenonce in the morning in the presence of the Pole, farmer Schwenzlswife made a casual remark to her husband to the effect that someonewould have to beat her to death if she had to eat as much as thePolak did, the defendant at noontime refused to take his midday meal.He also induced the Polish servant maid to offer the same passiveresistance. Farmer Schwenzl did not permit the defendant to act likethat, he called the Pole to account in the stable. The defendant put upresistance toward his admonitions by arming himself with a pitchfork.In the hallway of the farm, farmer Schwenzl continued his admonitions.The impudence and disobedience of the defendant is shown in all itsimpressiveness by the fact mentioned by the witness Schwenzl, that thePole at the threshold of the farm hallway turned against the farmeragain and only let him go when the sheep dog which they kept on thefarm attacked the defendant from the back.As proved by the defendants behavior as a whole, he took advantage ofthe circumstances caused by the war also in the crime under discussion.Being a Pole who had been given the opportunity to earn a fair wagein the Reich, he acted in the basest conceivable way. His crime aswell as all the rest of his impudent behavior classify him as a publicenemy. The German population which today is especially sensitive towardsuch attacks and needs--according to the sound public sentiment--anincreased protection against such foreign elements by sentences beyondthe customary penal code.Accordingly, the defendant was to be sentenced in connection withpersonal assault also a crime under section 4 of the decree againstpublic enemies of 5 September 1939.                                  IVThe defendant is a Polish national in the meaning of the Ordinance onLegal Procedure against Poles and Jews in the Incorporated EasternTerritories of 4 December 1941. On 1 September 1939 he was living onformer Polish territory; therefore punishment has to be pronouncedaccording to article III of the ordinance mentioned above, of articlesII and XIV in other instances.The action of the defendant means a considerable violation of the peaceto the persons immediately concerned by his base actions. The ruralpopulation is right in expecting most severe measures against suchterrorization by foreign elements. But beyond disregarding the honor offarmer Schwenzls wife, the attack of the defendant is directed againstthe purity of the German blood. Looked at from this point of view, thedefendant showed such a great deal of insubordination living in theGerman domestic sphere that his action has to be considered especiallygrave. Anyone who is acting like the defendant commits an outrageagainst the defensive power of the German people in the emergency ofwar. Wartime demands an essentially increased protection of the homecountry against the dangers of war.Accordingly, as outlined in article III, paragraph 2, second sentenceof the ordinance concerning Poles and Jews, the crime of the defendantwhich, compared with his other conduct, shows a climax of unspeakableimpudence, has to be considered as especially serious. Thus, the deathsentence had to be passed as the only just punishment which is alsonecessary in the interest of the Reich security to deter Poles with asimilar attitude.Decision as to the costs--article 465 Criminal Code of Procedure.

Stanislaus BieniaszJan Lopata, born on 24 June 1916 in Kajscowka, district of Myslenice.                         Petition for ClemencyIn 1940, I stayed in Germany as an agricultural worker with the farmerJosef Schwenzl at Bodenhof, where I had my residence together withAngelike Murzyn until 1942. Later on, on Sunday 7 February, I went toanother farmer whose name was Josef, I do not know his surname, butI know where he lives. He urged me continuously to come to him, andI went to see him on Sunday 7 February. On Monday 8 February, I wentto the regional labor office together with the farmers wife and fromthere the policeman took me along to prison, for what reasons, I donot know. Maybe on the grounds that for 2 years I worked hard and wellat the farmers; the Lord can see that from heaven how they treatedme and such things. The Polish woman is my very best witness, becauseshe has been working together with me and she knows everything, howthe farmer beat me in the beginning, and how he did not want to payme. The testimony given by the farmers wife during the proceedingsis not absolutely true. She has not told what they had hidden in thecorn on the second floor of the barn. Neither did she tell that theyslaughtered a pig for New Years day. At that time they chased us outof the house, and we were supposed to go to Peihof? [sic] and have aglass of beer together with the Polish woman. I immediately refusedto do that, and that is the reason why they urged us and said thatthey would also go and have a glass of beer and that we should notreturn home too early at least not before 8 oclock. They themselveswould not return so early either, at any rate not before late in theevening. When we then came back later--the sun had already set--theywere already at home. I was just about to enter the room in order tocut a few slices of bread for myself, as I always did. When I camehome Sunday night, and at that time cut bread for New Years Eve, thefarmer was already at home and was doing something in the other room.He called to his wife to bring him some salt. She went upstairs to getthe salt. When she came down with the salt she tried to hide it in away that the Polish woman should not see it. The pig had been deliveredonly shortly before the New Year. On New Years day, in the morning,the pig was still there and on the other day, Friday morning, that pigwas not there any longer. At the time mentioned in the evening, we wereurged to go to bed and later on, they turned on the light and arrangedsomething in the other room at night. The windows were screened. I donot know why. Because I was angry I left them. The farmers wife saidthat I did not want to get up in the morning, and that I did not wantto work. All that was seen by the Polish woman. Now I would be deeplyobliged if the death penalty could be commuted into a prison term. Ibeg you very much to do that, I forward my petition to the lawyer sothat he may try to bring it about. If I had enough money, I would payhim, but what can I do, if I have not got any? Perhaps I might beg thedefense counsel to do so without pay, and I beg him most humbly to havethis petition carried through as soon as possible.Munich, 22 November 1942                                               Signed: JAN LOPATA    For the correctness of the translation:Munich, 26 November 1942                                     [Signed] STANISLAUS BIENIASZ                    [Report of execution of Lopata]Sg 433/42 V.R.

The trial of the emigrated Jew Leo Israel Sklarek before thePeoples Court has proved anew that, in severe cases of preparationfor treason (art. 92 Reich Penal Code), there is need of institutingthe death penalty which so far is not provided for in article 92 ofthe Reich Penal Code. When deliberating on the draft of the PenalCode, the Fuehrer, during a cabinet session, had personally emphasizedthe necessity of threatening even with the death penalty in cases ofpreparation of treason. I, therefore, propose to supplement article 92of the Reich Penal Code accordingly.II. Inquiries that could be opened on the grounds of discoveries inthe occupied eastern towns have disclosed a case of treason in thetime prior to the seizure of power, when a German subject betrayedimportant military secrets. The act of treason of that German subjectdeserves death but cannot be punished with the death penalty accordingto the hitherto valid regulations since a retroactive effect of thelaw altering regulations of the Penal Code, dated 24 April 1934,[503]Reichsgesetzblatt I, page 341, which reformed at the time, theregulations against treason, is not provided for as yet. The disclosureof further severe cases of treason may be expected. It is, therefore,recommended that in the individual case, the section chiefs concernedbe authorized to order the retroactive effect of the regulationsagainst treason in order to arrive at the imperative severe punishmentin particularly serious cases of more remote date.Enclosed please find the draft of a law containing the two regulationsdiscussed above with the request for approval.

On 13 October 1941 and on 6 September 1942, he left this place   of work without permission. In the first case, he was arrested   at the police border in Kosten on 13 October 1941, district of   Kreuzburg (Upper Silesia), and after having been warned, was   taken back to his place of work. After the second breach of   his working contract he was arrested at the station in Munich   on 8 September 1942. When being arrested B. illegally wore the   Hitler Youth badge, and was in possession of _2_ tobacco   ration cards, bearing his name, and stated that he wanted to   escape to his aunt, Stefanie Truempler, Zuerich 4, Zwinglistr.   24 (Switzerland). On 8 September 1942 he was sent to the   reformatory labor camp Munich-Moosach by the Secret State Police   Office Munich--Document No. 27311/42 II E 3/Hoe--from which he   escaped on 10 September 1942. B. has not been involved in any   activity of a criminal, political or counter-espionage nature.

Gruppenfuehrer [Major General] Haas   S.A. Gruppenfuehrer Hohm   S.A. Gruppenfuehrer Koeglmaier, as representative of the Reich   chief prosecutor   Local Court Judge Dr. Pilzduly pronounces--The defendant, as a Pole, ventured to aid the enemy of the Reichby leaving his job in Lower Silesia, on 6 September 1942, to go toSwitzerland and to get in contact with the Polish Legion there. Afterhaving been arrested first in Munich, he succeeded in escaping from aninternment camp with two other Poles and in proceeding toward the Swissfrontier. On his way, he was arrested at Lochau (Vorarlberg).                 He therefore is sentenced to _death_The defendant, who is an ethnic Pole and who, as a former Polishsubject, had on 1 September 1939 his residence within the territoryof the former Polish republic, in November 1939 volunteered foremployment on a farm in Germany which he obtained at Metschlau (LowerSilesia). His conduct, however, was by no means in accordance with hisvoluntary enlistment. Already a few weeks later he left his workingplace without permission. He was picked up and allocated for work to afarmer in Buchenhang (district of Glogau, Lower Silesia). In October1941, although his living was provided for by free board and lodgingand monthly wages of 30 reichsmarks, he left that job, too, withoutauthority. Again he was arrested and brought back to his Buchenhangworking place after having served a prison term of 3 months, pronouncedon charges of breach of the working contract, in January 1942. Insteadof, as a Pole, taking his sentence as a serious warning, the defendantafter having received certain pieces of information on Switzerlandfrom Poles when on leave to his home town, gradually made up his mindto deprive Germany permanently of his capability to work, to escape toSwitzerland, and to apply there with the Polish or English consularoffice for enlistment in the Polish Legion. On 6 September 1942, hebegan to carry out his plan. Secretly he left Buchenhang and took atrain running toward the Swiss frontier, taking with him his savingsof 100 Reichsmarks and a Hitler Youth badge as camouflage. He was,however, arrested in Munich on 8 September and brought to the laborreformatory camp Moosach. On 10 September 1942, he escaped from thecamp together with two other Poles who also wanted to go to Switzerlandand continued his trip to Switzerland by going to Lindau. From there hetried to get to the Swiss border on foot and in order would have had tocross it illegally. On his way there he then was arrested by a customsofficial in Lochau (Vorarlberg) on 12 September 1942.The defendant admits the facts with the one proviso that his solemotive had been to look for a job in Switzerland and that he wantedto get in touch with some Polish people who, as he knew, lived inSwitzerland, and whose addresses he had got in his home town as beingable to get him work.This defense cannot be given credit. The defendant held a job inGermany and got, as a Pole, such fair wages that he was able to save100 RM within a comparatively short period. There was therefore nogood reason why he should have given up his place of work in Germany,in order to look for work in a foreign country, especially consideringthe illegal frontier crossing which in wartime is particularlydangerous. How little, after all, he really _did_ care for seriouswork is shown clearly by the fact that he repeatedly and withoutauthorization left his place of work.It must therefore have been for _other_ reasons that the defendantconsidered the idea of going to Switzerland. Based upon the experiencegained by the senate in similar cases, the way which was chosen bythe defendant, in order to reach the Swiss frontier, was taken bymany other Poles escaping from their employment in Germany for thepurpose of enlisting in the Polish Legion in Switzerland. On accountof the hostile propaganda from abroad, carried on everywhere amongthe Poles, it was generally known to the latter that in Switzerland,through the Polish Consul of the Polish puppet government, or throughthe British Consul, there existed an opportunity of joining thePolish Legion, whose aim, as the court knows, is to bring about therestoration of an independent Polish state including forced separationof the Incorporated Eastern Territories from the Greater German Reich,by rendering military service on the enemy side. According to theview taken by the senate, the defendant became informed about thesecircumstances while on leave in his home town. All the more so, as heexpressly admits having acquired the idea of escaping into Switzerlandfrom there. Furthermore, it should be added that the defendant is ayoung and sturdy Pole, who was absolutely fit for military service inthe Polish Legion. Besides this, his general anti-German attitude whichis shown by his breaches of contracts is compatible with his enlistmentin the Polish Legion, hostile to Germany. Finally he makes the samestatement for his defense as has always been made by other Poles tryingto join the legion, who are arrested in the neighborhood of the Swissfrontier. Apparently, this was recommended as a pretense by the Polishpropaganda machinery from the very beginning in cases in which escapeshould fail. Taking into consideration all these circumstances, thedefendants escape to Switzerland leads to the only possible conclusionthat he wanted to join the Polish Legion intending to fight as amember of the latter against the armed forces of the German Reich andto help bring about the success of the treasonable purposes of theLegion, which in spite of his denial and according to the view of thesenate, were known to him. He therefore may be considered as convictedof preparation of high treason according to article 80, paragraph 1;article 83, paragraphs 2 and 3 of the Penal Code and of undertaking toaid the enemy from inside our country according to the provisions ofarticle 91b of the Penal Code.[504]At the same time he has made himself guilty of a crime according toarticle I, paragraph 3, last sentence, of the Penal Decree for Polesof 4 December 1941.[505] Because, being a Pole, he has intentionallyinflicted damage to the interests of the German people by malevolentlyleaving his important agricultural job, above all, during harvesttime in September 1942, and by escaping abroad, thus trying to robforever the German people of his own labor. In view of the lack offarm workers, each single farm hand is decisive for maintaining thefood supply of the German people, and in consequence, for its stayingpower in the fight for freedom. Every deduction of manpower whatever isdetrimental to the German interests in a total war. This was absolutelyclear to the defendant who admits it, too.According to article 73, Penal Code, the penalty can be drawn fromthe penal decree concerning Poles which _loc. cit._ demandsexclusively the death penalty as a rule, this being taken from the mostsevere penal law applicable here.The senate, considering the defendants character, could see no reasonfor deviating from this threatened basic punishment, and for treatingit as a less serious case. By serving a 3 months prison term imposedpreviously on account of breaches of contracts, the defendant hadbeen given sufficient warning. He was offered a last chance finallyto come to his senses and to reason by his internment in the laborreformatory camp Moosach. All that, however, could not make the leastimpression on him. On the contrary, although as a Pole he was held toexcellent conduct and unrestricted labor service in view of the bloodguilt of which the Poles before and at the outbreak had made themselvesguilty against the German people, he stubbornly stuck to his hatredagainst Germany. Furthermore, beyond the fact that he deprived us ofhis services, he stubbornly and without disregarding the opposingdifficulties, continued to pursue his aim of fighting against Germanyon the enemy side, and of accomplishing his attempt at high treason.The death penalty therefore represents the only adequate measure whichdoes justice to the criminal action committed by the defendant, who isdominated by his fanatical hatred against Germany, and to the securityrequirements of the German people. This appears absolutely necessary inorder to create a deterrent. It has been for these very reasons thatthe Peoples Court passed the death sentence on the defendant.As a condemned person, the defendant has to bear all costs of theproceedings.

He is of mixed race, first degree; his motherwas a Jewess. From 1919 until March 1922 he was a member of the SocialDemocrat Party. He is now a malicious adversary of the NationalSocialist State.In March or April 1943, he repaired the wireless set of TheresiaDraxler, retired post office secretary. When leaving her apartment, hesaw an application form for joining the total war effort on the kitchentable. He asked the witness Draxler whether she had already filled inthe form and added:   Do you know that every woman who goes to work, sends one   soldier to his death?The witness Draxler did not answer him. Then the accused left theapartment.He denies, but has been convicted by, the trustworthy statement of thewitness.The remark of the accused aims at preventing a person from fulfillingthe duty of registering for the total war effort. This attempt toburden the conscience of a woman who is willing to work by seeking tomake her responsible for the heroic death of soldiers jeopardizes thedevotion of women for work, and has a damaging effect on the nationsfighting morale and its will of self-preservation in total war. Theaccused could not count on Mrs. Draxler keeping his remark to herself,but had to reckon with the fact that she would speak of the incident toother people and that his utterance would become known to wider circles.

Findings[509]The 44-year old defendant has had German citizenship since theAnschluss. His deceased mother was a Jewess. After passing throughprimary school and a 4-year high school course, he was trained as anelectrician at a trade school in Vienna which he attended for 5 years,and then held several jobs until 1924. Next, he worked independently asa radio engineer and radio dealer in Vienna. He claims to have earnedabout 300 RM a month lately. From 1919 to 1922 he was a member of theSocial Democratic Party. _Later on he belonged to the FatherlandFront._The Draxler couple were among his customers in Vienna to whom he hadsold a radio several years ago. At Mrs. Draxlers request he hadrepaired it several times. In March 1943 Mrs. Draxler called him inagain to overhaul the radio. As he left the apartment, he happenedto see lying on the kitchen table an application form for employmentin the total war effort. Believing this to be Mr. Draxlers form, heasked Mrs. Draxler whether she too had filled in such a form. Whenshe informed him that she had got the form for herself, he said: Yourealize, of course, that every woman who goes out to work, sends asoldier to his death? Mrs. Draxler who was very indignant about thisremark refused to answer, and he left very soon afterward. Later onshe spoke of this incident to some of her acquaintances, among othersto the wife of a political leader in the NSDAP who reported it to theOrtsgruppe.The senate considers these facts to be correct on account of thetrustworthy statements made under oath by Mrs. Draxler. The defendantadmits that he was in the apartment of the witness in the spring of1943 to test the radio and to have left through the kitchen; he deniedemphatically, however, during the preliminary proceedings as well asat the trial to have made the remarks with which he is charged or anysimilar remark. He maintains to have only discussed business matterswith Mrs. Draxler as with his other clients. The woman might have beenannoyed that the radio had been out of order several times and hadtherefore reported him. The witness might have heard the remark fromsomebody else and mixed it up. His attitude was not hostile to theThird Reich. He had advised a National Socialist, Walter Pindur, whoduring the Schuschnigg period had supplied him with cardboard out ofwhich swastikas had been cut, to be careful. The Party members, seniorcustoms inspectors Schmidt and Scerences would be in a position totestify to it that he had not been an enemy of national socialism. Aninquiry at the Ortsgruppe Rembrandt would show that he had done repairwork for them free of charge.The defendant cannot have any success with this defense. The witnessDraxler firmly maintained her statements in the face of all hisobjections and the senate, from her bearing at the trial, gained theconviction that the witness did not wrongfully accuse the defendant outof annoyance because her radio did not work. Furthermore, she deniedto have been annoyed at all and pointed out quite rightly that shehad not made the report. The senate is convinced that by his denialsthe defendant is only trying to avoid the serious consequences of hisoffense. To interrogate the witnesses Pindur, Schmidt, and Scerencesand to obtain a statement from the Ortsgruppe Rembrandt in Vienna issuperfluous in view of the facts, especially if one considers thatfor ulterior motives the defendant would not have disclosed his trueopinion to these witnesses nor to the Ortsgruppe._The way in which the accused spoke calmly and deliberately, andwithout any apparent cause, only an enemy of the State can think andspeak._The utterance which the accused is known for certain to have madeto the witness Draxler was liable to impair her as well as otherpeoples willingness to work for the total war effort. By thisremark he attacked therefore the fighting morale and the will forself-preservation of the German people, and this he did publiclywithin the meaning of article 5, number 1 of the Extraordinary WarPenal Ordinance, as he had to count on the fact _and he actuallydid count on it_ that the witness, whom he did not know well wouldspread his remarks--as actually did happen. The senate is furthermoreof the opinion that the accused was fully aware of the defeatistnature of his remark and the publicity in the above sense. Thus, theconditions under article 5, paragraph 1, number 1 of the ExtraordinaryWar Penal Ordinance of 17 August 1938 apply. The fact that theintention of the accused was without any result as regards the witness,does not affect this state of affairs--the purpose of the aboveordinance is not merely to prevent any undermining of the peoples willto self-preservation, but to prevent all possibility of undermining it.It is out of the question to assume a less serious offense because theaccused acted with the intention to undermine morale and because [bythe remorse combined with it][510] _the appeal to the emotions_of a woman prepared to join the war effort represents a _wellcalculated_ and particularly mean _and dangerous_ attackon the German nations will to self-preservation. Accordingly, thedeath sentence, which is the only penalty provided for the crime ofundermining the military efficiency, was passed on the accused.Owing to the dishonesty of his offense, the accused forfeited his civilrights.Costs have been awarded according to the law.

Having retiredafter the collapse, he was a naval training officer from 19261936.Paschen, since his retirement, is a resident of Flensburg and moves inthe circle of the Danish minority. He had a political discussion at theend of August 1943 with two Danes, unknown to him, who wanted to renta furnished room in his house. He then expressed the view that he didnot believe in a German victory and that he thought the secret weaponsto be propaganda bluff. Furthermore, he stated that Denmark had beentreated unjustly in 1864 and that the Reich must give Schleswig back toDenmark.One of the Danes adopted these views as his own and tried to shake theconfidence in victory of a woman naval auxiliary with whom he had anaffair.The sentence will be executed.Berlin, ....

The development was speeded up by the events at Stalingradand in Italy. This found its outward expression in the followingmeasures: setting up a special committee for cases of undermining themorale--for serious and acute attempts at undermining morale--in theReich Ministry of Justice, a corresponding agreement with the ReichSecurity Main Office, by taking steps concerning the distribution ofwork at the Peoples Court and by a press campaign. A number of SpecialCourt districts and also certain criminal divisions with the districtcourts of appeal have not yet followed the new practice. The severityof their sentences does not agree with the penalties of the sentencesat the Peoples Court. Conditions are to be made clear by this reportand by a Judges Letter.[513] The temporary defensive attitude at thefront means a burden for the home front. The enemy is looking for weakspots, and thinks he has found them in the will for self-assertion ofthe inner front, as it was 19141918. Since the Italian events he hasbeen intensifying this attack. The not very numerous cases of defeatismresulting from it have led to a new line in the administration ofjustice in cases of undermining of military efficiency, which is to beorganically followed in the treatment of cases concerning maliciouspolitical acts. The following cases dealt with by the Reich Ministry ofJustice, are intended to illustrate this line.Clear cases of serious undermining of the military efficiency_Case Dr. Geiger_--a 52-year-old physician, Party member, no priorconvictions._Offense_--In summer 1943, the condemned man made a remark duringthe treatment of the pregnant wife of a Hitler Youth Leader who wasat the front at that time that she had courage in having a child now.For if things went wrong, we would be in a bad way. After the eventsin Italy the war was lost for us, a victory of the Russians meant ourphysical death, a defeat by the English and Americans was still thesmaller evil. She--the patient--was too much under the influence ofNazi propaganda. To the scared question of the pregnant woman, what wasgoing to happen to all of them, the condemned man answered that personsliving such an exposed position (as her husband) naturally would bedealt with in the first place. Then there would be a mass Katyn.[514]Sentence of the Peoples Court--8 September 1943--death sentence.Request of the public prosecutor--death sentence. Plea for clemency wasrefused._Case Weber_--a 60-year-old dentist, Party member, no previousconvictions._Offense_--In August 1943 the condemned man made the remark to apatient--hardly anybody still believed in victory. Medieval methods oftorture were applied in our concentration camps; especially homosexualswere being too harshly dealt with; we had murdered a million Jews andtherefore had incurred a grave burden of guilt. Rudolf Hess was theright man but not the Fuehrer. The condemned man went on literally:Moreover, in 4 weeks time, the Fuehrer will no longer be alive. Youwill hear about it.Sentence of the Peoples Court of 15 September 1943--death sentence.Request of the public prosecutor--death sentence. Plea for clemency wasrefused.In cases of undermining the morale the consideration of the actualnature of the facts must not be excessive. In the fifth year of thewar every German has to think about the effect of his remarks to otherpeople. The same applies to foreigners, who are working here and enjoyGerman hospitality. Critical, for instance, authorized discussions ofthe political and the war situation are not punishable only as long asthey are not calculated to shake the convictions of others.Up until now, no need has been observed to give the prerequisitepublicly in article 5 of Extraordinary War Penal Ordinance a morerigid interpretation than is done in cases of malicious political acts.As such to be considered are remarks falling under article 2 of thelaw against insidious attacks on State and Party, which do not resultin influencing other people. Two examples are the cases of Krejci andKochzius._Case of Krejci_--41-year-old home worker, no previous convictions._Offense_--In spring 1943 the condemned woman told the followingjoke:   Who is the biggest farmer in Germany?   Adolf Hitler, he owns a lame dog, a fat pig, and many million   sheep.   (With the lame dog and the fat pig she meant Goebbels and   Goering.)Sentence of the Special Court II Berlin of 5 October 1943--6 monthsimprisonment._Case of Kochzius_--a 57-year-old printer._Offense_--At the beginning of 1942, the condemned man answeredthe greeting, Heil Hitler, with, Shit.In December 1942 when Fuehrer parcels were distributed in the plant, hemade the remark that he did not want the Fuehrer and these parcels, hewas no beggar.In January 1943 the condemned man declared, that the Fuehrer was atramp; a vagabond without a Fatherland who came from abroad where onlybeggars lived; he intended to make the Germans into beggars too; he wasmaking the people ridiculous in the eyes of foreigners by the streetcollections. The entire government as well as the Party consisted oftramps and rascals.To a Party member he remarked, that he had better hurry up and get out,otherwise he would be hanged from a tree later on. Sentence of theSpecial Court II Berlin of 28 September 1943--1 year imprisonment.Border line cases are the cases of Graf, Kessel, Eckert, and Heinitz._Case of Graf_--a 65-year-old farmer, no previous convictions._Offense_--In spring 1943 the accused declared, Hitler mustabdicate, then the war will stop.In autumn 1943 he made the remark, The war will not stop until Hitlerabdicates.In October 1943 he remarked, The Germans bled to death in the advance,and now they bleed to death in the street. In summer, one runs to saveevery little berry, and now one has to watch how everything perishes.It only depends on a few gentlemen. With the war it is just the samething. All their throats should be cut.In agreement with the general public prosecutor, the Chief PublicProsecutor proposes not to order prosecution under article 2 of thestatute against malicious political acts but to warn the defendantby imposing a fine. The defendant had a good reputation and was aparticipant of World War I, had several sons at the front, and hadalready backed the NSDAP before it had taken over.The opinion of the field offices that this case was one of maliciouspolitical acts cannot be agreed to. It rather represents a case ofundermining the morale, which has already been submitted to the ChiefPublic Prosecutor for examination.       *       *       *       *       *_Case Eckert_--domestic servant, 50 years of age, single, noprevious convictions._Offense_--In the afternoon of 14 September 1943, the accused,in a shop, said to the female proprietor in front of partly unknownpersons, By Christmas, the war will long be over. Germany has longsince been divided up. Obviously she alluded to a defeat in the verynear future. When asked by an employee of the local health insuranceoffice, how she thought it would be if the war were lost and we wouldall have to go to Russia, the accused replied, Very well, let themsend those 5 million SS men there. During the last air raid on Mannheimthe SS, those bloody swines, chased the people out of the shelters withrubber truncheons for fire-fighting and clean-up work.The Chief Public Prosecutor with the approval of the GeneralPublic Prosecutor wants to base the charge on article 2 of the lawagainst malicious political acts or insults to the State or Party(Heimtueckegesetz)[515] and to propose a prison term of 9 months. Thisis a border line case. Certainly the statements made by the accused intheir second part fulfill the conditions of malicious political actsor insults to the State or Party. Regarded as a whole, however, theaccused obviously had in mind to injure the listeners will to pullthrough, as can be seen from the first part of her statements. Whenshe met with resistance in doing so, she tried to support her opinionby abusive language and by telling atrocity stories. The trend of herstatements therefore was directed toward undermining [the militaryefficiency].[516] Therefore, the accused will, in the first place, haveto be prosecuted under this provision.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *    PARTIAL TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT NG-671    PROSECUTION EXHIBIT 220EXTRACTS FROM THE SITUATION REPORT OF DEFENDANT LAUTZ, CHIEF PUBLICPROSECUTOR AT THE PEOPLES COURT, TO THIERACK, 19 FEBRUARY 1944,CONCERNING THE UNDERMINING OF MILITARY EFFICIENCY                                 Copy                                         Berlin W 9, 19 February 1944                                         Bellevuestrasse 15The Chief Public Prosecutor of the Peoples Court4206 E--2.36                                            [Initials] KL [Klemm]                                [Stamp]                                SECRETTo the Reich Minister of JusticeBerlin W 6Wilhelmstrasse 65Decrees of 25 October 1933--IIIa 19570/35 and 29 October   1942--3130-Ia _9_ 1746-.Enclosures: 2 copies of the report.[Handwritten illegible marginal notes][Handwritten note] M.D. IV Mr. B.S.S. request to be informed inregard to p. 9.[Signed] MARTIUS 28 February                          _Situation Report_  A. _High treason and undermining of military efficiency within the            Reich territory (except for the Protectorate)_I. _General._       *       *       *       *       *       *       *In accordance with the expectation expressed already in my previousreport of 8 October 1943, the number of incoming reports oninvestigations concerning undermining of military efficiency has againincreased considerably. At present the daily average amounts to about25 cases. Since, in addition, numerous investigations which are nothandled by special proceedings and which could not yet be concluded arepending, I am forced at present due to the pressure of business in myoffice and the further difficulties caused by the effects of the terrorraids to make more extensive use of my right to turn matters over toanother office. However, in the interest of a uniform jurisdiction theindictments will principally be served before the Peoples Court in allcases where--_a._ The undermining activity involves members of the Wehrmacht._b._ Greater significance is ascribed to the statements of theaccused because of his position in public life or in the economy._c._ The accused has become known as an enemy of the Stateon principle or a systematic instigator either according to hispersonality or because of the nature of his offense._d._ The personality of the accused in connection with the natureof his offense or the effect he strived for seems to point to specialtreatment._e._ The offender belongs to the clergy.In view of the necessity of turning over proceedings, even in which theoffense can be called a serious one without question, I have generallyinformed the chief public prosecutors concerned in advance of thealtered way in which I am going to handle my right to turn matters overto another authority. In addition to this they will in each singlecase be especially informed about my conception of the case and willbe requested within the limits of my right of turning cases over tothem, not to consider taking on less serious cases but to strive forthe highest possible penalty if the state of the investigations atthe moment the case is handed over gives a sufficiently clear pictureof the case in this respect. In comparison with the previous report,no essential new experiences were gained regarding the nature of theoffenses and the personality of the offenders. Especially could itnot be determined that the number of punishable offenses increased,particularly in those territories subject to a special air terror ofthe enemy. It is rather characteristic that the manifold rumors aboutalleged riots among the population in the cities damaged by air raidsoften arose in regions not at all or only slightly affected by theair terror. This leads, on the one hand, to certain conclusions as tothe intentions of the propagators of these rumors. On the other hand,however, it can be taken as a pleasing sign for the truly disciplinedattitude of the population that suffers most from the enemys airterror.II. _Special Proceedings._       *       *       *       *       *       *       *                                              [Typed] signed: LAUTZ      EXTRACT FROM THE TESTIMONY OF DEFENDANT SCHLEGELBERGER[517]_DIRECT EXAMINATION_       *       *       *       *       *       *       *DR. KUBUSCHOK (counsel for defendant Schlegelberger):According to the document I have before me, Document NG-412,Prosecution Exhibit 77,[518] the Ministry of Justice made a suggestionto increase the severity of penal provisions concerning the preparationof treason. Would you explain this?DEFENDANT SCHLEGELBERGER: The situation with regard to the lawwas the following: Preparation for treason [Landesverrat] could not bepunished by death. Treason, that is to say the betrayal of the nativecountry in my opinion, is the most severe and most serious politicalcrime, and the danger inherent in that crime reveals itself alreadyin its preparation. As can be seen from the document, the questionhad come before the public and had been discussed in public on theoccasion of the Sklarek case, and had become the subject of a heateddiscussion. It was known to me that Hitler once before in a cabinetmeeting had taken the position that preparation for treason should bepunished by death. It was quite obvious for me that as a consequenceof the Sklarek case and, on that, Hitlers point of view was alsoknown to other people, a new storm would come up; in fact it was theexpressed purpose to force matters upon the administration of justiceso that afterward one could make use of these matters, by saying thatthe administration of justice itself was not strong enough to findthe right position, or in order to institute and justify proceedingsoutside the administration of justice. I considered it appropriate,therefore, to bring this question into the stage of a legal regulationas quickly as possible. In the draft the death penalty was providedfor very serious cases, cases of aggravating circumstances, and thatprovided the guaranty at least for the fact that in ordinary courtproceedings it would have to be examined whether that really was asevere case. The danger was quite acute that unless in time such a lawwould be promulgated, other elements, namely, the police, would haveseen to it and would have taken care of it wholesale without examiningindividual cases. Since the cases in question were cases of the past,retroactive measures had to be permitted. That is well within all legalguaranties.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *          EXTRACTS FROM THE TESTIMONY OF DEFENDANT LAUTZ[519]_DIRECT EXAMINATION_       *       *       *       *       *       *       *DR. GRUBE (counsel for defendant Lautz): Mr. Lautz, is itcorrect that in 1938 you received an offer to become senate presidentin the Reich Military Court?DEFENDANT LAUTZ: That is correct. I was well known to theMinisterial Director at the High Command of the Wehrmacht, Lehmann, whoappeared as a witness before this Tribunal and who offered me in 1918to become senate president at the Reich Military Court.Q. Just a moment, I believe you made a mistake, you meant to say 1938?A. Yes, 1938.Q. At that time, would you have improved your financial situation ifyou had accepted?A. Yes. The position was much better paid.Q. Why did you not accept that position?A. I did not accept it only for the one and decisive reason that I didnot want to leave the beautiful district of Karlsruhe for the timebeing.Q. For how long were you general public prosecutor in Karlsruhe?A. Unfortunately, only until 1939.Q. May I now ask you, who was Parey?A. Parey was Reich Public Prosecutor since 1936, later chief Reichprosecutor [Oberreichsanwalt] at the Peoples Court in Berlin.Q. And for what reason did Parey leave his office as Chief ReichProsecutor at the Peoples Court?A. At the beginning of November 1938. He had an automobile accident.Q. When did you find out for the first time that you were beingconsidered as Pareys successor?A. At the beginning of December 1938. The then Under SecretaryFreisler, on order of Minister Guertner, informed me that Guertner hadchosen me as his--that is, Pareys--successor.Q. Did you make any efforts to obtain that position?A. Not at all.Q. Did you do anything against your appointment as chief Reichprosecutor at the Peoples Court?A. I was very much interested in getting out of being appointed to thatposition, and because of that I consulted with the personnel divisionof the Ministry as to how I could prevent my appointment. However, Iwas told that Minister Guertner attached importance to my taking thatposition, and therefore, being a civil servant I complied.Q. May I ask you why you had an aversion to that office?A. First of all, because of the exclusive occupation with politicalpenal cases and in connection with that the absolute dependence uponthe Ministry which was my superior was not an inducement for me; eventhough, at that time, I could not have the remotest idea that war wouldshortly break out, that Minister Guertner would die, and that throughall these events a course would be followed in politics which, in anycase, was not in accordance with the one that I imagined.That was my main reason. My second reason was that I wanted to remainin Karlsruhe.Q. When were you appointed Chief Reich Prosecutor?A. I was appointed on 1 July 1939.Q. At that time, did you still count upon becoming Chief ReichProsecutor, since Parey had already left the office some time before?A. Since it took such a long time I had the hope, quietly, that perhapsanother person would be found.Q. Did you ever find out whether any office of the Party or any otherorganization of the Party was in favor of your appointment as ChiefReich Prosecutor?A. I never heard anything about that.Q. When, in effect, did you assume your office as Chief ReichProsecutor at the Peoples Court?A. Due to illness, I only assumed office on 20 September 1939, inBerlin.Q. However, you had already been appointed on 1 July?A. Yes.Q. Mr. Lautz, may I ask you this? Before 1933, did you belong to apolitical party?A. From 1924 to 1930, I was a member of the German Peoples Party. Thatwas the party of Minister Etresemann, who became well known throughthe policy of understanding which he followed toward the victoriouscountries of 1918, and whose efforts, in particular to reach anunderstanding with France in order to bring about peace in Europe, Iwelcomed very warmly and supported.Q. When did you become a member of the National Socialist Party?A. On 1 May 1933.Q. Will you please tell the Tribunal for what reasons you joined theParty?A. Before the spring of 1933, I belonged to the Prussian JudgesAssociation, in which organization I worked on press matters as amember of the board of directors. The Prussian Judges Associationdecided to urge its members to join the Party. I joined because,according to the situation prevailing at the time, I considered it tobe the correct and proper thing to do.Q. Mr. Lautz, at that time in 1933, did the joining of a party have thesignificance of 100 percent approval of the Party platform? Was it notrather like this, that since the Weimar era joining a party by no meansimplied that one approved of its ideology?A. In the case of many persons who joined the Party at that time, thatwas so.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *Q. Through my documents in Lautz document book 1, I have already shownthat the competence of the Peoples Court to sentence defeatist caseswas introduced only beginning in February 1943. Witness, for how longdid the special penal regulations for wartime exist on which thesetrials against undermining of military efficiency were based?A. This special wartime penal order is from 1938[520] which was putinto effect only on 26 August 1939.Q. Originally the Reich military court was competent for those casesof undermining of fighting force or the other military courts, is thatcorrect?A. Yes. That is correct, not only for members of the Wehrmacht but alsofor civilians.Q. In 1940 the competency in regard to civilians was transferred to thegeneral courts?A. Yes. That is correct.Q. Who became competent at that time for the cases of the so-calledpublic undermining of military efficiency?A. Public undermining of military efficiency was prosecuted by thesenior public prosecutors at the special courts and/or was to be triedby the Special Courts.Q. When in 1943 the cases of so-called public undermining of militaryefficiency were transferred to the Peoples Court, had the law, ineffect, been applied for 4 years?A. Yes.Q. Is it correct, Witness, that the decision as to whether a publicundermining of military efficiency was proved depended upon thefollowing two points: first, what does the legislator mean by anattempt to undermine; and second, when was this attempt to underminecommitted in public? Is it correct that those were the two nuclei inthis question?A. Yes.Q. Is it furthermore correct that, when in 1943 the Peoples Courtbecame competent, these two basic questions of undermining of fightingefficiency were based on a general jurisdiction originating first fromthe Reich Military Court, then the Reich Supreme Court, and then of theSpecial Court--that these decisions existed already?A. The Reich Military Court had in several very basic decisions decidedthese questions without any doubt.Q. In regard to these points from which it is especially evident thatthe definition of public attempt of undermining had already beenlaid down definitely in 1943, I shall prove by some further documents.Witness, how did the individual cases of undermining come to youroffice?A. That differed. In part, the senior public prosecutor at the SpecialCourt who considered the case as leaving room for no doubt submittedthe files to me. If, on the other hand--and that occurred in themajority of cases--he harbored doubts whether this was not merely amalicious act, then, as was his duty, he reported it to the Ministerof Justice, and the Minister of Justice decided whether a case wasto be regarded as undermining of fighting efficiency and should betransferred to the chief Reich public prosecutor.This is evident from the affidavit by the witness Franke, which theprosecution submitted.Q. May I refer to the fact that this is Exhibit 515[521] submitted bythe prosecution. Furthermore, I am referring to Exhibit 97[522] of theprosecution. Witness, did it continue the way you described it justnow, later on too?A. Later on, two more basic changes occurred. A very severe decreeof 13 August 1943 was introduced. Minister Thierack required a moreexpeditious and more emphatic trying of certain especially seriouscases of undermining of fighting strength. For this purpose, ithad been ordered that the RSHA submitted those cases which were notvery numerous, either through the hands of the Minister of Justiceor directly to me. I submitted them to a special division becausethe division which treated other cases of undermining of militaryefficiency was no longer in a position, merely due to the large numberof cases, to take over this new work also. These cases in the mainare those in which the so-called quick trials [schnell termine] tookplace which have frequently been discussed here already. Due to theimportance of the cases, Freisler also did not let anybody deprivehim of trying these cases basically in his senate. Moreover, due to alater decree by the Minister of Justice, it was laid down that in thepreliminary investigation of the cases which were to be submitted tothe chief Reich Public Prosecutor, that the presidents of the districtcourts of appeal should be included in order to avoid too many of thesefiles being submitted to the office of the Reich Public Prosecutor.The final decree which concerns these cases, and which I am citingbecause perhaps it is important in the von Braun case, is thefollowing instruction by the minister. If an indictment is filedbefore the Special Court in a malicious acts case, and during thetrial the Special Court decides however that possibly this might be anundermining of military efficiency in which case the Special Court wasnot competent to sentence, then the Special Court should not through anuncontested decision refer this to the Peoples Court, but the ChiefReich Public Prosecutor should ask for an adjournment so that the chiefReich public prosecutor could examine the case in every individualcase. If he considered it not suitable, he was to return it to theSpecial Court. In this way, it was intended to prevent that throughsuch decisions against which it could do nothing, the Peoples Courtwas burdened with cases which did not concern it.Q. Witness, how were pending cases treated? How were the caseswhich came to it treated by the office of the Reich prosecutor, andespecially how was the conduct of the members?A. When the order came into effect--the order of 29 August 1943--atwhich time the Peoples Court became competent, at that time I was onan official trip outside of Berlin. When I returned, I found out thatthe defendant Barnickel, who at that time was my deputy, had handedover the handling of the cases which came to his division. At thattime, he was of the opinion--at least, that is what he told me--thathis division was less burdened and therefore was in the best positionto be able to handle the new influx of cases. I let matters stand asthey were.First, we introduced the following treatment of the cases and we alsomaintained this for several weeks and months. At certain intervals of2 or 3 days, every case that was handled by the expert or the Referentin the presence of the division chief was reported to me, and then wemade a decision as to whether we wanted to file an indictment beforethe Peoples Court and for what reasons this was necessary. Varyingreasons governed this. In part, the cases were so serious that therewas no doubt about this. In part, we considered it necessary in orderto bring about certain basic decisions on principle--to bring aboutthe sentencing by the senate of the Peoples Court. During that time,the number of prison sentences that were pronounced was without doubtlarger than the number of death sentences. The enormous incidence ofnew cases, however, brought it about, and this is also apparent fromthe situation report which the prosecution submitted, in the beginningof 1944--Q. I may interpolate here that the defendant is speaking of ProsecutionExhibit 220.[523]A. That at the end of the year 1943, quite a considerable number ofcases were in arrears. Therefore, I decided that in regard to thecases of undermining of fighting strength to gather them in a specialdivision which would have the task--especially in regard to the backlogcases--to clean it up as quickly as possible. Among these, there werea number of cases of arrest whose expeditious handling was necessaryespecially because in a large number of these cases the transfer toa subordinate court was necessary. Therefore, I could not act inany other way. No division chief was anxious to be given this newdivision. Therefore, I decided that the defendant Rothaug should takeit over.[524] First of all, he was the youngest division chief, andup to then he had been in charge of a division which was so small andinsignificant that it was easiest to replace him by a senior publicprosecutor.From the situation report which I mentioned, it is also evident whatthe number of cases was which came to us at the time. They amounted toabout seven to eight hundred a month. This figure shows me that when Iwas interrogated preliminary to this trial, I made a wrong estimate. Atthat time I thought it was twice as high as it actually was.Q. Witness, you have just said that the number of cases in theundermining of military efficiency increased to about seven to eighthundred cases a month. I would like to put another question to youon that subject. Did that mean that before the Peoples Court sevenhundred to eight hundred cases of undermining of military efficiencywere tried every month?A. No. That figure refers to the number of cases which were submittedto the Reich prosecution for examination. As I will mention later, onlya small percentage of those cases--I estimate about 10 percent--werekept back. All other cases were returned to subordinate courts. In mysituation report, if I may repeat that, I only gave the number which Idid mention there because only at the trial here I saw that situationreport again. I ascertained that the figures which I had given inExhibit 126,[525] from memory were evidently incorrect.Q. By that you mean to say that the figures in Exhibit 126, the figureswhich you gave from memory, are too high?A. That is what I did mean to say.Q. How did you, in general, treat these questions of underminingmilitary efficiency?A. To a large extent the treatment of such cases depended on the clearinstructions from the Minister of Justice. It also depended on thebasic importance of these cases. To mention one example, I would liketo revert once again to the situation report of 9 February 1944, thatis Exhibit 220. In that report it says that the undermining of militaryefficiency when committed by clergymen would have to be tried beforethe Peoples Court. That was due to a decree by the Reich Ministerof Justice. Generally speaking, however, in treating these cases Iattached the greatest importance to having every single file examinedcarefully by the head of the department so that those points would notbe left unobserved which would justify treating that case in a morelenient manner. For in particular the transfer of these cases as beingcases of lesser importance to the district courts of appeal or to theSpecial Courts, to that I attached the greatest importance, as far asit was at all possible. That is proved not only by the testimony of thewitness Gruenwald[526] before this Tribunal but it is also evident fromProsecution Exhibits 178, 474, and 100.[527] For the numbers of caseswhere criticism was exercised by the ministry on sentences passed bylower courts, and in particular at the Weimar conference [_NG-674,Pros. Ex. 100_] would remain incomprehensible unless many caseswhich were more serious had been transferred to the lower courts by theReich prosecution.In the last analysis, perhaps the percentage of cases which we keptback, as I mentioned before, and of the cases where an indictment wasfiled, at the Peoples Court, I estimate those cases at 10 percent.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *Q. Witness, do you still remember what information you received inregard to the question whether recruiting offices for the Polish Legionexisted in Switzerland?A. I said that already. From the answer of the head office of theborder police in Stuttgart, it was apparent without doubt thataccording to the information which they had from Switzerland thatthere was an illegal recruiting and transport service which helpedPoles to get to Switzerland and to Africa; to that extent, Switzerlandapparently did everything that it was possible to do, and as far as itcould; and from the files it is occasionally apparent that the Swissborder officials returned the Poles who had crossed the border fromGermany; but in all cases they probably did not succeed.Q. Had the Ministry of Justice also informed you to what extentrecruiting offices for the Polish Legion existed in Switzerland?A. If I remember correctly, the same information had also reached usfrom the Foreign Office via the Ministry of Justice.Q. Thank you. The prosecution seems to assume that the indictmentswere not the results of attempts to join the Polish Legion, but were ameans to prosecute Poles because of their flight from Germany and theirplaces of work. Please comment on this.A. For us, that certainly was not the motive for the filing of anindictment, because we were convinced that the suspicion was justified.Moreover, against such allegations the fact probably speaks which canbe gathered from Exhibit 259[528] of the prosecution. From that it canbe gathered that particularly at the time in question here, hundredsperhaps thousands of Poles left their places of work in the Reich; andif only a very small number of these were tried before a court becausethey wanted to join the legion, this makes it apparent that theywere not tried only because they left their place of work. The otherparticipating offices, that is the police and the counterintelligenceof the OKW, were probably also of the opinion that here we were facednot only with flight from the place of work, but flight for a specialpurpose.The general situation was just as I described it. During the war theGerman Reich, as any warring power, had closed its borders and this hadbeen done for reasons of the security of the State and was thereforenecessary because everybody who crossed the border and reached neutralcountry or an enemy country took along with him important experiencesand knowledge which he had gained in the warring country. Poles knewthat too.Q. Witness, you have already stated before that a Pole, only for thereason that he had left his place of work on his own, could not betried and sentenced by the Peoples Court. Now, according to yourdeterminations in the individual cases in which Poles were indictedbecause of attempts to reach the Polish Legion, did other reasons forsuspicion also play a role which supported the suspicion on the basisof which then in accordance with the law you were obliged to raise anindictment?A. I just wanted to talk about that.Q. Will you please state what reasons for suspicion have regularlyplayed a role also?A. If somebody crosses the border with a certain purpose in mind andhe is caught in the act, then, in the most infrequent of cases will hebe inclined to say and be ready to say what intentions he had in mind,for in so doing he would damage his own case. Criminal cases which wereconducted under this point of view--and this is probably not the caseonly in Germany--therefore are based to a large extent on the justifiedconclusions one can draw from the facts available.Now, it was here known generally what I have already stated, that thisway led to the Polish Legion if one started out on it. Secondly, itwas known that among the Polish workers in south-western Germany theseconditions and knowledge thereof were widespread. Furthermore, it wasgenerally known to those workers too that favorable conditions for workcould not be expected in Switzerland; and finally, it was in accordancewith the experiences which had been gathered in other trials that alarge number of these people who crossed the border after their arrestdid not even deny this intention. These general considerations alonewould have, in my opinion, justified such a strong suspicion that inaccordance with German Code of Criminal Procedure sufficient suspicionfor the filing of an indictment existed, and that thus the indictmenthad to be filed in accordance with the law.The two indictments which bear my signature are the Bratek andStefanowitsch cases. The following element, however, is added. Bratekhad referred to the fact that he only wanted to cross the border inorder to avoid work.DR. GRUBE: In the Bratek case here we are concerned withProsecution Exhibit 136.[529]DEFENDANT LAUTZ: As I said, he claimed it was only for thereason to attempt to seek work that he did want to cross the border.By means of the additional investigations which the division chiefinstituted, however, it had been found that he did not like to work;he had already left other places of work, so that his statement thathe wanted to seek new work in another country in which there weredifficult conditions of work did not seem very credible. So for thatreason his statement had to be accepted with reservations.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *_CROSS-EXAMINATION_       *       *       *       *       *       *       *MR. KING: I ask you if it were possible to commit treasonagainst an individual who was not of German citizenship in the periodwhich we are discussing.DR. GRUBE: I object to this question. This is a question whichis asking only for the personal opinion of the witness.PRESIDING JUDGE BRAND: The objection is overruled.DEFENDANT LAUTZ: If I understand you correctly, Mr.Prosecutor, you want to know whether the act of treason was punishableonly when it, the act, was directed against the State as such, or alsowhen it was directed against an individual person.MR. KING: Yes. My following question was going to refer tothe differences which you raised. But actually you have stated it verywell. I want to know whether at this time the period which we areconcerned with at the moment, if during that period treason could becommitted against an individual who was not a German citizen, and Itake it that your answer on that is no, is that correct?DEFENDANT LAUTZ: That had been different ever since the law of1934.Q. Yes. I know but I am speaking of the law prior to 1944.A. No, what I said was 1934. I said the law before 1934. I am referringto the law 1934 with article 91 [of the Reich Criminal (Penal) Code]which then became a law.[530]That article says that the act of treason can be directed againsta German national as an individual, and it was a question ofinterpretation whether German should here be interpreted as beingof German blood or being a German citizen, and the famous documentin which I made a report to the Reich Ministry of Justice deals withthat question.[531] It is that report which concerns itself with thatquestion. The courts in the Reich interpreted article 91 to the effectthat it was not the nationality which was decisive but the race, theblood.Q. Yes. Well, it is that letter to which I want eventually to refer. Iwanted, however, to get your understanding of the earlier laws beforewe get around to discuss the question of that letter. What you havejust said was that article 91 which was adopted in 1934 expanded theconcept of treason to the extent that there could be treason against anindividual who was a Reich national; is that correct?A. Against a German. And who is a German? That was a question ofinterpretation. I believe I can best make myself clear if I come backto the example which is mentioned in this report. After the occupationof the eastern territories, that is Poland, that is to say after theoccupation of those territories, which formerly had been German, thefollowing case came to our knowledge. An ethnic German, a person whowas a German by blood, had had the following experiences. Behind hisback a Polish agent had hidden espionage material in his home withoutthe German knowing that that material had been hidden there. ThePolish agent then chased the Polish police after him, and his home wassearched by the Polish police. The material was found and the Germanwho was completely innocent but who could not prove his innocence wastried in Poland before 1939 and he got a very heavy prison sentence. Idont think you would approve of that, would you? When we occupied theeastern territories that case came to our knowledge--Q. Excuse me, Dr. Lautz. Is this the Krippner case to which you refer,or is this the Moses case? There are two of them which you mentioned inthis report.A. No, no. I cannot remember the--Q. Would you like to see that exhibit?A. I cannot remember the name unless you would show me the document.The name doesnt matter. It is the facts of the case that matter here.Q. I think you will find this report referred to in document book 5-B,beginning on page 73 of the German text.PRESIDING JUDGE BRAND: Dr. Lautz, will you finish what youwere saying when counsel interrupted you?DEFENDANT LAUTZ: Yes. I will. After the occupation of Polandthat shameful case, to use a mild expression, came to the knowledge ofthe German authorities; and we were now concerned with the question asto what could be done; and the application of article 91 of the GermanCriminal (Penal) Code was interpreted so that in this case treason hadbeen committed against a German. Treason had been committed against aman of German blood, treason which could be prosecuted.Q. It was treason against one of German blood who was not then a Germancitizen.A. He was not a German citizen, but he was of German blood.Q. The date of that again? When that happened, when it came before thisdepartment?A. Your Honor, may I just have a look at the report? May I have a lookat the report to make sure of the date?Q. Yes.A. That is the case Goleck, which is mentioned in the report. The falseaccusation against the person of German blood was made in the year1938, that is to say, it happened before the war.Q. And it came up to the Ministry of Justice after the war to decide?A. That happened during the war when Polish files were confiscated.MR. KING: Dr. Lautz, you have the letter before you now?DEFENDANT LAUTZ: Yes.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *Q. May I ask you to refer to the top of page 75 in the German text, Ibelieve it is? It is the middle of page 68 in the English.PRESIDING JUDGE BRAND: What exhibit are you referring to?MR. KING: I am referring to Document NG-548, ProsecutionExhibit 347, Your Honor.Now, could we look at that separate opinion of yours at the end of theletter?DEFENDANT LAUTZ: Yes.Q. Go ahead, please.A. It begins with the words, With the Reich Leader SS and thePresident of the Peoples Court I agree with this.Q. Dr. Lautz, see if you can find this portion in the document whichyou have. I am sorry you dont have the document book as it wasoriginally distributed. I had it paginated for that. Can you find thisstatement? You say, Therefore--and I believe this is part of yourletter--Therefore, I find it necessary, on principle, to protect bymeans of the German Criminal (Penal) Code those racial Germans who haveseriously suffered through action such as mentioned in article 91,paragraph 2 of the Penal Code, provided that action deserves punishmentin accordance with sound German sentiment but where such punishment,considering the elements of wrongdoing of that particular case, cannotbe brought home on the strength of any other directly applicable penalregulation.Those are your words, are they not?A. Yes.Q. And then you say in the final paragraph of the letter, In themajority of the cases it will be offenses which have been committed byforeign nationals abroad against racial Germans. Is that correct?A. Yes, it is.Q. That is correct, and those are your words?PRESIDING JUDGE BRAND: Will you answer audibly so thatreporters may get it?DEFENDANT LAUTZ: What the prosecutor stated just now is what Ireported.MR. KING: And then you asked for approval of yourinterpretation; is that correct? That is the very last sentence in theletter?DEFENDANT LAUTZ: Yes. I had to ask for that because thedecision lay with the Minister of Justice.Q. Yes. Now, in subsequent cases that came before the Peoples Court inwhich you were required to file the indictment, you based the chargeson the interpretation which was subsequently approved by the ReichMinistry of Justice, the interpretation which you ask here? Is thatright?A. From case to case the Minister of Justice afterward decided as towhether that procedure was to be adopted or not. He did not issue ageneral instruction or directive.Q. Do I understand you correctly? Let me restate it. Did you mean tosay that even after you asked for this interpretation it was necessaryin the future when cases came up involving these facts that theMinister of Justice give his approval before you filed your indictment?Is that correct?A. The indictment was drafted, and the draft was submitted to theMinister of Justice, and he approved it or did not approve it.Q. But the draft of the indictment was based on the law which yousuggested be interpreted as we have discussed it. Then having draftedthe indictment based on this interpretation you got approval ordisapproval, as the case might be, from the Minister of Justice. Isthat right?A. Yes.PRESIDING JUDGE BRAND: What was the answer?MR. KING: The answer was yes, Your Honor.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *        EXTRACTS FROM THE TESTIMONY OF DEFENDANT BARNICKEL[532]_DIRECT EXAMINATION_       *       *       *       *       *       *       *DR. TIPP (counsel for defendant Barnickel): Witness, pleasedescribe further events.DEFENDANT BARNICKEL: About the end of 1937--beginning of1938, I was in Berlin again. I told the personnel Referent, who was adifferent official then, about my wishes for the position in Munich,but the case was not that far yet. To my great surprise, on 30 November1938, I received the communication that, on 1 December 1938, I was tobe appointed Reich prosecutor with the Peoples Court.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *Q. When and how did you assume your new position?A. As I have already explained, I received the formal appointment on 30November 1938. The Minister granted me a few days to straighten out myaffairs in Munich, and thus, I assumed office on 6 December 1938.Q. What position did you hold in the beginning?A. On 3 November 1938, the chief Reich prosecutor of the PeoplesCourt, Parey, had had a fatal accident. His permanent deputy, atthat time the only Reich prosecutor, Parisius, was in the hospitalseriously injured. On 1 December 1938, three new Reich prosecutorshad been approved for that office. Of those, two were from the officeproper, and I was the third one. Upon instruction by the minister, Iwas to be in charge of the office as a deputy because according to myage I was the oldest of the three Reich prosecutors there.Q. Witness, in this connection, I should like to discuss a documentsubmitted by the prosecution. It is Prosecution Exhibit 347, DocumentNG-548. The letter has the heading Chief Reich Prosecutor with thePeoples Court and is of 23 April 1942, and is directed to the ReichMinister of Justice. In this letter, another letter by the Reich LeaderSS and Chief of the German Police of 13 December 1941 is quoted. Thelatter letter is directed to, and I quote, The Chief Reich Prosecutorwith the Peoples Court, attention: Senior Reich Prosecutor Dr.Barnickel, or deputy. You are therefore addressed as Chief ReichProsecutor with the Peoples Court, Witness. Can you please explain howit may have come to that designation?A. I cannot answer that question with absolute certainty because I donot happen to know why the office which sent that letter did it. Itis, however, certain that I was never Chief Reich Prosecutor with thePeoples Court. I was only Reich prosecutor at all times, although,during the first 2 months, I deputized for the Chief Reich Prosecutor,but during the first few years of my activity I frequently receivedsimilar letters. The first few times, I actually opened them. Later, Isent them to the office for incoming mail unopened. I assumed at thattime that some office of the Gestapo, by mistake, had entered my nameas Chief Reich Prosecutor on their records because, in the beginning,I was in charge of the office as a deputy. But the main point seems tobe the following. I can see from the letter which is addressed to me,that it is quite clear that I never had anything to do with the answerto that letter. I see that with absolute certainty from the contents ofthe letter.Q. For how long after you assumed the office were you in charge of theaffairs of the Chief Reich Prosecutor?A. Until 1 February 1939.Q. Did it happen frequently later that you had to deputize for thechief?A. Yes, but not very frequently. The Chief Reich Prosecutor and hispermanent deputy appointed by the Minister, Reich Prosecutor Parisius,of course, tried to arrange not to be absent at the same time. Onlyif that did happen, I, as the oldest Reich prosecutor, had to takecare of affairs. I have to correct myself, that is to say, after ReichProsecutor Parisius, I was the oldest. Since the end of 1943, I wasno longer used to deputize. I was evacuated to Potsdam at that timeand Reich Prosecutor Weyersberg was the deputy of the Chief ReichProsecutor.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *Q. * * * May I ask you now to direct your attention to ProsecutionExhibit 159, which we have already mentioned? That is the ProsecutionDocument NG-381.[533] It appears in document book 3-G, on page 22of the German and page 19 of the English text. The subject of theseproceedings is the trial of Oscar Beck, for undermining the militaryefficiency.PRESIDING JUDGE BRAND: A correction, for the purposes of therecord. Exhibit 159 is in document book 3-D, at page 17 of the English.DR. TIPP: Thank you.The indictment appears on page 2 of the document, and following pages.On page 4 there is the signature, As deputy, Dr. Barnickel. That isto say, you signed that indictment. Apparently you did so when you weredeputizing for the chief who was away. At any rate, the document doesbear your signature. Would you please tell us why that indictment wasfiled with the Peoples Court?DEFENDANT BARNICKEL: Because of the fact that I was sooverburdened with work at the time, I cannot remember any details ofthe case. However, I can say for certain that the reason for filing theindictment with the Peoples Court was not--I am referring to the factwhich has been mentioned here before--that Beck was of mixed descent,first degree. I think I have explained sufficiently my attitude to thatquestion in general, but I shall revert to that subject later. Thatattitude of mine had remained the same for 10 years, and I did notchange it in 1943. The fact that it was a Vienna Ortsgruppenleiter whodenounced the man--that fact, too, is of no importance. I believe it ishardly necessary for me to mention this, but for my department, too,which submitted that case to me, it was of no importance either.As I look at that indictment now, I am inclined to assume that wewanted to arrive at a basic decision. The novel element in theproceedings against Beck was the fact that he had criticized theemployment of women. That was a measure which only started in the firstweeks of 1943. It was designed to keep up production, and it had beenordered by the Reich and not by the Party. I believe that all thebelligerent countries had introduced measures of that kind.According to the date when the indictment was filed, it is possiblethat this indictment of Beck was the first one of its kind. Not onlythe legal questions decide what the basic element of such a case is,but novel facts of a case also can constitute a basic element.For the rest, ever since I had been acquainted with the Reichprosecutors office, occasionally less significant cases, where onewas not expecting a very serious sentence and certainly not the deathsentence were indicted with the Peoples Court if they were of acertain importance for the whole country.Q. Witness, you say, then, that you believe the indictment was filedwith the Peoples Court because the case was important for the wholecountry and because it contained a novel element?A. Yes, that is possible.Q. Does the form of the indictment show that it was the intention toask for the death sentence?A. No, on no account. When the indictment was phrased, and inparticular because of the legal provisions which were cited, in allthat there is nothing to indicate that it was intended to ask forthe death sentence. On the contrary, and I should like to refer tothe enclosure, the letter which was sent with the indictment. It waswritten on 30 July 1943, to the presiding judge of the Peoples Court.In the second paragraph of that letter, which is also signed by me, itis expressly pointed out that under article 2 of the law of 20 December1934, prosecution under that law had been ordered. That law was theInsidious Acts Law, which has been mentioned here a great many times.I should think that is a proof for the fact that we considered theapplication of that law also possible, for otherwise it would have beenstupid to make reference to it. The maximum penalty for violation ofthe Insidious Acts Law would have been a 5-year sentence. I think it ispossible that not only the question of the employment of women was thecause for taking this case to the Peoples Court, but also the questionof the application of the law in general.Q. Witness, what was the senate with which your department cooperatedin the field of undermining military efficiency?A. It was the fourth senate, and the presiding judge was Dr. Koehler,whose name has been mentioned in a favorable context repeatedly here.May I state that in 1944 Dr. Koehler was transferred from the PeoplesCourt to Stettin, because Freisler did not approve of him. The fourthsenate dealt mainly with high treason cases. Later on it also had todeal with the undermining of military efficiency. However, when thedistribution of work was changed again, it had to return those casesbecause there was dissatisfaction with the sentences that that senatehad passed.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *PRESIDING JUDGE BRAND: I wonder if you could tell me whatwas meant by the last phrase in that letter, where you say, Theprosecution under article II of the law of 20 December 1934 has beenordered as a precaution. The part, the prosecution has been orderedas a precaution, what did you mean by that?[534]DEFENDANT BARNICKEL: Your Honor, by that I want to say thatthat passage points out that if sentence was not to be passed onthe basis of undermining military efficiency, prosecution under theInsidious Acts Law would be made.Well, that was a case of a measure which might be taken, Your Honor.Q. I understand. Was it the practice to appoint defense counsel even incases where the death penalty was not expected, in your court, in thePeoples Court?A. Your Honor, at my time--I dont know what happened later--but at mytime, every defendant who appeared before the Peoples Court had tohave a defense counsel without exception. That had nothing to do withthe death penalty.PRESIDING JUDGE BRAND: Thank you.DR. TIPP: Witness, may I repeat my question. I may ask you totell us what were these general prerequisites for filing an indictment?DEFENDANT BARNICKEL: Well, that question has been touchedupon repeatedly here. There had to be sufficient suspicion thatthe defendant had committed the offense, that is to say, a certainprobability was sufficient.Q. In connection with the undermining of military efficiencyparticularly in this case, I think a further question is important. Thequestion, what did one mean when one said the undermining of militaryefficiency in public?A. According to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Reich Court and theSupreme Military Court, military efficiency was undermined in publiceven if statements had been made in front of only one person, if theoffender had to expect that that person would pass on his statements toan indefinite number of other persons.Q. These two prerequisites, therefore in your opinion in the Beck case,did exist?A. Yes.Q. Now, one more question concerning the undermining of militaryefficiency cases in general. Were all those cases dealt with by yourdepartment?A. To start with, yes; from the summer of 1943, however, certaincategories of cases were transferred to Department I, whichcollaborated with Freislers senate. According to the distribution planof the Peoples Court, Freisler could also deal with certain cases frommy department, at his senate.Q. How long was it that your department dealt with those undermining ofmilitary efficiency cases?A. Until 31 December 1943. Then they were transferred to anotherdepartment.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *           EXTRACTS FROM THE TESTIMONY OF DEFENDANT ROTHAUG                        ON THE LOPATA CASE[535]_DIRECT EXAMINATION_       *       *       *       *       *       *       *DR. KOESSL (counsel for defendant Rothaug): The Lopata casewas first tried by another court and not by the Special Court inNuernberg.[536] Please tell us what was the first court that tried hiscase and whether that court was a Special Court.DEFENDANT ROTHAUG: The case was tried for the first time on 28April 1942, before the local court at Neumarkt in the Upper Palatinate.The local court was not a Special Court.Q. What were the facts which were the subject of the proceedingsagainst Lopata during the trial at Neumarkt?A. The defendant had been charged only with having approached a womanin a way which was sexually offensive, although that woman again andagain tried to get rid of him. He was also charged with irregularbehavior, which, however, in the course of developments played noimportant part and that charge was dropped.Q. Please tell us what was the personal description of the defendantwhich was given by the local court at Neumarkt?A. In the judgment, it is pointed out that the defendant looked wellgroomed, but he was insolent, lazy, and he had been guilty of theoffense with which he was charged in a way, and I quote, Which showedan unheard of extent of shamelessness and insolence of which only amember of the Polish nation would be capable. However, that is astatement made by the local court at Neumarkt.Q. Did the local court at Neumarkt have anything to do with the SpecialCourt at Nuernberg?A. Nothing. No.Q. Was the judgment by the local court at Nuernberg upheld?A. The judgment by the local court at Neumarkt was by decision of theReich Supreme Court of 14 July 1942 annulled by way of a nullity plea,and the trial was transferred to the Special Court at Nuernberg.Q. What was the criticism of the Supreme Reich Court in the judgmentpassed by the Neumarkt local court?A. The Reich Supreme Court criticized the fact that the local courtat Neumarkt, concerning certain generally known conditions which wereconnected with wartime conditions, although that had been obvious inthe case in question, had not taken such conditions into consideration,and therefore apparently had ignored the fact that the offense withwhich the defendant had been charged also violated article IV of thelaw against public enemies. For that reason, it was necessary to referthe case to another court so that the case be examined from that pointof view, and if that should be found right, so that article IV ofthe law against public enemies could be applied, if that were foundapplicable. Further reasons for the decision which are given are thatthe application of article IV of the law against public enemies wouldmean that a considerably higher penalty could be pronounced, and thatfor that reason the case would have to be tried again.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *Q. In its opening statement the prosecution quoted the followingsentence from the judgment: The inferiority of the defendant lies inhis character, and the reason for it evidently is that he belongs tothe subhuman race of the Poles. Is that quotation correct?A. Well, there is a typing error here which rather distorts mattersbecause actually it says in the judgment--it doesnt say the subhumanrace, but it means the subhumanity of [Polnisches Untermenschentum],and that is something essentially different. We have subhumanity inGermany and we have developed our own laws against that and when wespeak of Polish subhumanity we do not mean the Polish people as such;that is what we would have meant if we had spoken of the subhumanPolish race, and for that idea and opinion there is a concrete reason.In many cases we had found that among the Poles who had been brought toGermany there was a considerable number of highly criminal types fromPoland. The agencies which dealt with getting labor from Poland didnot select properly and thereby created a great danger. We discoveredpeople who had been previously convicted for murder and had beensentenced to penitentiary for life, but who on account of the outbreakof war had been set free, and who had now come to Germany. That pointof view played a part in considering all these questions. That is tosay, we did not speak of the subhuman Polish race but we spoke of thesubhumanity in Poland.PRESIDING JUDGE BRAND: May I interrupt, please? The questionof translation has arisen. The Tribunal would be glad to have a checkmade by the prosecution as to the original document and the propertranslation of it. That will dispose of this entire matter.MR. WOOLEYHAN: Yes, Your Honor.DR. KOESSL: The originals of the files here--I dontknow--probably the prosecution has the copy, and perhaps that copy alsohas the mistake.PRESIDING JUDGE BRAND: It is a question of what the documentsays and it should be able to be ascertained with definiteness. Thesuggestion that the document may have used the wrong word is notsatisfactory to us. We want to know what word was used in the originaldocument.[537] Go ahead to something else and straighten that outafterward.DR. KOESSL: Witness, at the trial before the Special Court atNuernberg, were any facts brought to light which were not mentioned bythe judgment passed at Neumarkt?DEFENDANT ROTHAUG: That is clearly evident from the judgment.In addition to the facts which had originally been established, afurther fact had been established according to which the defendant hadattacked the old people who were living on a lonely farm with a dungfork and had exerted so much pressure on them that the only way forthem to save themselves was to unleash the dog.When evaluating the character as a whole of the defendant, as thejudgment shows, that fact was taken into account. That fact in the lastanalysis was decisive.Q. Can you show that that point in particular was very decisive? Canyou show us that by quoting a passage from the original file?A. That is shown by our attitude to the clemency question. In ouropinion on the clemency question we, without exception, repeated thosefacts which had been decisive for us in deciding on the sentence. Wedid not state other general points of view concerning the clemencyplea because we didnt know them, and secondly, because we were of theview that they didnt affect us in any way. That brief opinion on theclemency question says--   The character of the defendant has been clearly described at   the trial, in particular also the fact that the defendant, apart   from the offense which in its execution was very grave, has also   made himself guilty of violent behavior toward his employer.In other words, it is made perfectly clear here that the last point ofview was decisive for us.PRESIDING JUDGE BRAND: May I ask you a question to which theanswer, I think, could be brief? My notes show that the defendant wassentenced to death for violation of articles 2, 3, and 4 of the law ordecree concerning Poles and Jews. Is there such a provision in yourjudgment? You neednt read it. Just tell me if that is in there.DEFENDANT ROTHAUG: Yes.PRESIDING JUDGE BRAND: Thank you.DR. KOESSL: The witness Doebig said that the offense in hisview was not designed to prove that the offender was a public enemy.Would you, therefore, please briefly summarize the points which ledyou to assume that a very serious offense had been committed?DEFENDANT ROTHAUG: The justification for our sentence canbe seen from the opinion given by the court, and that is before thisTribunal. I cannot say any more. All I can add is, that specificallyfor this case that is to say for the original case that had to be dealtwith, that is to say, for molesting the woman in a sexual way, therewas a decision from the Reich Supreme Court which stated an opinionspecifically in regard to this question and discussed it from its basicangles, and that decision evidently was the cause for considering thedeath sentence at all.With us a further point of view was added and it was that decision thatwas made available to the court.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *PRESIDING JUDGE BRAND: I should like your professionalopinion. Was the nullity plea[538] involved in the Lopata case? I dontremember at the moment.MR. WOOLEYHAN: Yes, Your Honor.PRESIDING JUDGE BRAND: What is your best, honest judgment asto whether or not if Lopata had been a racial German there would havebeen a nullity plea and a direction from the Reich supreme court toretry the case? What is your honest opinion about that?DEFENDANT ROTHAUG: Mr. President, these two cases cannot becompared with each other because the Reich Supreme Court in this casestated its opinion on the basis that he was a Pole.Q. Now, I am asking if Lopata had been a racial German, all other factsbeing the same as they were in the Lopata case, is it your judgmentthat the nullity plea would have been invoked and that the ReichSupreme Court would have ordered the case sent back to you for anothertrial? I should like your opinion on that.A. Mr. President, this question is very interesting, but I cannot evenimagine that possibility, even theoretically, because the very elementswhich are of the greatest importance could not be applied to a German.PRESIDING JUDGE BRAND: Thats all I wanted to know.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *                   F.

The priest Schosser announced in church afterthe usual Sunday evening May devotion that the transportation to thecemetery and Last Sacrament of the Pole would take place immediatelyafterward. Induced by this announcement, about 50 people, mainly womenand children, participated in the funeral procession and prayingloudly, as usual, rendered last honors to the Pole. A large number ofthe population took offense at this incident.By this action the priest Schosser has malevolently criticisedthe national political demands of the National Socialist State.Furthermore, he has debased the dignity of the German people in anincredible way and has caused a great number of fellow Germans tobehave in an undignified manner.Judging from the usual attitude of the priest Schosser it may beexpected that after having been informed of the charges made againsthim, he will try to influence possible witnesses.

Theregulation that divine services for prisoners and persons in custodywill no longer be held is to be interpreted from the context. As thetitle already indicates, the measures of the ordinance are due to thewar. The preamble to the ordinance already defines the purpose of theadjustment of the application of the ordinance due to total war. Thispurpose also restricts the application of the regulation under No. 4.Divine services are only temporarily canceled and only then where theyare incompatible with the demands of total war.Divine services at the present time are incompatible with the demandsof total war where and insofar as they necessitate time which isessential to work for the waging of total war. Nor are they compatiblewhen and where the crowding of prisoners or detainees during divineservice constitutes a danger in itself or mixing the congregation ofthe institutions church or in view of the small number and the ageof the supervisory staff, it represents a danger to the institutionssecurity and thereby continuous production.Insofar, however, as the time needed for the requirements of totalwar is not interfered with by the hours of divine services and themaintenance of the institutions safety can be guaranteed, divineservices may also be held in future especially at Christmas and othersacred holidays.

WOOLEYHAN: Witness, would you please state your full nameand your profession?WITNESS SCHOSSER: My name is Luitpold Schosser; I am aCatholic priest.Q. Father, where is your parish?A. My present parish is at Wolfseck near Regensburg.Q. Has that been your parish for some time in the past?A. That has been my parish for 3 years and 3 months.Q. Where was your parish before that?A. Before my trial, my parish was at Vilseck.Q. Father, where were you born and when?A. I was born on 28 April 1909 at Bernhausen, in the Holledau [CentralBavaria].Q. What education did you have, and where was it?A. For 4 years I attended grammar school in my own home villageHadersbach. Then, for 9 years I went to the high school at Straubing.Then, for 5 years I attended the university at Innsbruck, and for 1year the Theological Seminary at Regensburg. In 1934 I was consecratedpriest. Then, I was assistant vicar in several places. At the end,I was at Vilseck. Then my trial started, and after my trial from 1February 1944 I have been a priest at Wolfseck.Q. Father, while you were a priest at Vilseck, were you ever arrestedand imprisoned?A. At Vilseck, I was arrested twice, and at Regensburg, I was arrestedonce, because after my arrest I was not allowed to go back to Vilseck.Q. Would you please state the dates, so far as you remember, of eachtime that you were arrested and imprisoned?A. Yes. For the first time I was arrested on 1 June 1942, and I waskept in prison for 14 days by the police. That warrant was filled in bythe Gestapo. After I had been imprisoned for 2 weeks, I was released.In the meantime, a second warrant for my arrest was issued by theSpecial Court of Nuernberg, and on 1 July I was arrested again. Then,until 21 August--that is for 7 weeks, I was in custody pending trialat Weiden in the district court prison of Weiden. Then, again, I wasreleased and a few days later another warrant for my arrest was issuedagain by the Special Court of Nuernberg. Then, I had been in prisonuntil 18 December 1943. For the third time I was arrested, that was atRegensburg--and my arrest was made by the Gestapo.So, altogether, I was arrested three times; twice at Vilseck and onceat Regensburg.Q. Father, at any time during any of these three arrests, did thepolice ever tell you who had signed the warrant for your arrest?A. Yes, when I was arrested the second time, the police commissioner ofVilseck told me that the warrant was issued by Rothaug from the SpecialCourt of Nuernberg.Q. After you had been arrested, Father, and imprisoned those threetimes that you describe, you also mentioned a trial. Were you everindicted and tried before a court?A. My trial took place on 18 December, that is on 19 December 1942, andthe trial took place before the Special Court of Nuernberg at Amberg.The trial took place because of a [Heimtuecke] insidious attack, duringa sermon which I had made 15 months before at Vilseck.Q. Father, you state that you were tried on 19 December 1942, by theSpecial Court of Nuernberg, but that the trial took place in Amberg. Isthat correct?A. Yes, that is correct; it took place at Amberg, at the town hall.Q. Would you please repeat again, so far as you know, the violation oflaw for which you were indicted and tried?A. Well, the first arrest originated from the burial of a dead Polewho died at Vilseck and was sent over to the morgue from the hospitalas was customary there with the dead. The dead Pole, as every otherCatholic, was transported from the hospital to the morgue, therefore,the church had given him the sacrament in the morning. In the morningof this day he asked for a priest, and he was prepared for death.During the afternoon, then, he died. In the evening before we had ourevening vespers--that was on a Sunday--the attendant of the morgue cameto see me, and he informed me that I had to order the transport of thisdead Pole from the hospital to the morgue and would have to take overthe arrangements. I asked him whether it was permissible for me to dothat, and he said, Yes; the Magistrate has ordered that you do it.Therefore, I had no further doubts, and I went to the morgue, that is,to the hospital, and I ordered the transport which was sponsored by thechurch.Before I made my sermon at the evening vespers, as is customary atevery transport of the dead, I communicated to my parish people thatlater on a dead Pole would be transported from the hospital to themorgue, because the people want to know who is the dead, who is in thecoffin in order to be able to know whether they have any obligationto attend the funeral or not. Of course, as it was a Sunday, therewere quite a number of people in the church, comparatively, and quitea number of them attended the funeral, because thus they had anopportunity to go to the cemetery, which was situated outside of ourvillage.Now, because of this communicating the fact to the people, I wascharged mainly by the Special Court. They considered it an invitation,that is to say, that I intentionally invited the population to attendthe transport of the dead Pole. That was the main charge made againstme by the Special Court of Nuernberg.They said that at this occasion, as the president said during thetrial, I was said to have expressed religious feelings and used themintentionally in order to sabotage the directives of the State.Q. Father, may I interrupt, please? You state that at the trial, themain charges, so far as you know, were this conducting of a funeralfor the Pole and a sermon that you preached the previous year. Is thatcorrect?A. Well, the main charge in my trial was the sermon. That was the realreason for the trial, during the trial, the sermon was not so muchdealt with but rather this whole matter with the Pole was dragged intothe trial. In each detail it was talked about--just about this matterof having had the Pole transported. I was considered an insidiouspriest, and this was told to the public.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *Q. Now, Father, the sermon that you delivered on the occasion in 1941,to which the indictment referred, what text was that sermon?A. Well, the text was the sermon of the seventh Sunday after Pentecost.It is read every year. It is in Chapter VII of Matthew. Beware offalse prophets who walk around in the cloak of lambs but who in theirinterior are roaring wolves. You will recognize them from theircloaks. That was the beginning of my sermon.Q. Father, was this verse from Matthew the text of the sermon on thatday every year?A. Every year we use the same text.Q. Now, Father, of the witnesses that were called against you--Ibelieve you said there were four or five, which was it?A. There were four witnesses from Vilseck and the Gestapo official Alt,but during the trial he didnt talk at all.Q. Well, of those four witnesses that did speak at the trial for theprosecution, how many of them heard your sermon of the preceding year,on the seventh Sunday after Whitsuntide?A. Two witnesses had heard my sermon. It was the wife of theOrtsgruppenleiter and the newspaper distributor Meyer Johann.Q. What did the newspaper distributor say or testify about your sermon?A. During the interrogation by the Gestapo official, he declaredthat my preaching had been aggressive; he said that my sermon was anincitement.Q. Father, you said that during the Gestapo investigation, he said thatyour sermon was aggressive and inciting, but that during the trial hedenied that. Is that true?A. Yes, during the trial he denied that he had said that the sermonhad been an inciting sermon. This expression Hetzpredigt, [incitingsermon] he did not use. That is what he said during the trial.Q. Describe, Father, the testimony of the other witness that had heardyour sermon; namely, the wife of the mayor and Ortsgruppenleiter.A. Well, the wife of the Ortsgruppenleiter had only referred, duringthe trial, to what she had told the Gestapo official, and the otherwitness, Kuffer, brought forward merely personal matters in order topaint me as an insidious priest.Q. But this last witness that you speak of, Kuffer, had not heard yoursermon, had he?A. No, he had not heard my sermon.Q. But the mayors wife had, is that correct?A. Yes, the wife of the Ortsgruppenleiter attended the sermon and heardit.Q. Well, Father, at your trial did the mayors wife testify or was thestatement she had given the Gestapo only introduced?A. No, the wife of the mayor only answered questions put to her by thepresiding judge. She, herself didnt say much.Q. During the trial, Father, so far as you remember having observed it,will you please describe Rothaugs conduct and words and statementsfrom the bench.A. Right after my trial, in the cell of my prison, I took somestenographic notes concerning the remarks made by the presiding judge,Dr. Rothaug, and on the strength of those stenographic notes which Ihave here on my table, I can make the following statement concerningthe trial. First of all, the presiding judge referred to my educationand there he became very personal right away and charged me with thefact that my whole theological education was rather backward, andthat it would have been much better if I had studied something otherthan theology. He said that I only observed the whole development ofnational socialism as a bystander looking from the window. During mytrial, the Hitler Youth passed the town hall, and at that occasionthe presiding judge made the remark, those down there, the HitlerYouth, that is the real life. Later on, in the course of the trial,the presiding judge very often made ridiculing remarks concerning theCatholic religion, and made insidious remarks concerning the professionof priest. Some of these remarks, I can tell you literally, and theywere the following: You Catholics allege that only Catholics willreach heaven, all others will be in hell. That is an assumption whichno Catholic will ever make. Then, he said, and this remark was repeatedagain and again, Not water gives value to man, but rather the blood.And, of course, the water he referred to was the Catholic sacrificialwater, or the water on the head--sanctifying water. For the NationalSocialist ideology has to be given to the child already with the milkof his mother; and there it appears my parents had failed to educate mein this direction. Those were merely personal remarks.Q. Father, may I interrupt a moment. Are you saying that the presidingjudge, Rothaug, made the remarks, such as you have just described, toyou from the bench, during the trial?A. Yes, from the bench, during the trial. These remarks, I may say thatafter all they were not only meant for me, myself, but for the wholeprofession of priesthood.Q. Father, you have said that in your indictment, the main charge wasone of malicious statements made during that sermon in 1941, but youalso said that during your trial Rothaug said much more about thebusiness of your giving a funeral service to the Pole. Can you give anyfacts to explain why you say that?A. Yes. Special Court Judge Rothaug dragged two things mainly intothis trial. First of all, the removal of crosses from the schools inthe district of Vilseck, and then this transporting of the dead Polefrom the hospital to the morgue. If I may add something concerning thismatter of transferring the dead Pole; there again I can give you somemore details.Q. Yes, Father, I would be very interested in what Rothaug said aboutyour transporting the dead Pole.A. The whole courtroom was fully occupied. I, as well as the peopleattending the trial, was quite astonished especially by Rothaug goinginto the details concerning this Pole matter. He came back again andagain on this matter in order to prove to me that I really had madeinsidious statements; and that I had had insidious and bad intentions,and on this occasion Rothaug showed a terrible hatred against thePolish people.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *Q. Father, after your trial was concluded, what sentence did youreceive?A. I was sentenced, on the grounds of insidious attacks, to 15 monthsof prison, and 3 months of custody pending trial were counted.Q. Father, after the ceremony and sermon which you preached on theseventh Sunday after Whitsunday 1941, how long was it from then untilyour trial, approximately?A. About 15 months.Q. Then, for 15 months after you preached the sermon for which you weretried as having made insidious utterances, nothing was done to you bythe way of trial; is that correct?A. No, during these 15 months nothing happened.Q. One moment, Father, please. Fifteen months after your sermon, duringwhich nothing was done, you were tried, and part of the case was thefuneral sermon you conducted for a Pole, is that correct?A. May I ask you to repeat the question, please?Q. Father, 15 months after your sermon, during your trial, your conductof a funeral for a Pole was a part of the trial, wasnt it?A. Yes, during the trial.Q. Now, Father, when was this funeral for the Pole that you conducted?A. That was on the third Sunday in the month of May. I think it must beabout 17 May 1942.Q. In other words, Father, the sermon that you preached, on which themain count of your indictment was based, was 15 months before yourtrial, and the Polish funeral was 2 or 3 months before your trial? Isthat correct?A. Well, the funeral of the Pole was in May 1942, and the trial tookplace in December 1942. That would be about 6 months.MR. WOOLEYHAN: There is no further direct examination, YourHonor.PRESIDING JUDGE MARSHALL: Does any defense counsel desire tocross-examine this witness?DR. KOESSL (counsel for defendant Rothaug): I ask to examinethe witness.THE PRESIDENT: You may proceed.    _CROSS-EXAMINATION_DR. KOESSL: Witness, for the first time you were arrested on 1June 1942, is that correct?A. Yes.Q. You said before that you made the church sponsored transfer [to thecemetery] of the Pole, and that you were arrested because of that. Wasthis church sponsored transfer of Poles prohibited?A. It was not prohibited for Poles, but I was charged with only thepublicizing of this fact.Q. I could not quite get that, unfortunately. May I ask you to repeatwhat you were charged with?A. I was charged with the fact of having publicized this churchsponsored transfer which is usual at Vilseck, and that I made itpublic. That was explained as if I had invited and even asked thepopulation to attend the funeral.Q. In other words, you were not charged with having transferred thisPole and sponsored it by the church, but rather, it was the fact thatyou had violated the State directives, is that correct?A. Yes.Q. The first point was dealt with only by the Gestapo?A. Yes.Q. In other words, Rothaug had nothing to do with that?A. No, he had nothing to do with that.Q. However, you were charged with other violations of State directives,were you not? Is that correct?A. No, that is not correct. The Ortsgruppenleiter Stubenvoll hadinformed the Kreisleiter, Dr. Kolb, and he raised the point againbecause this sentence of 2 weeks was not enough for him, and that isthe way this matter came to the Special Court in Nuernberg, and then itwent on.Q. Well, did this matter lead to a trial then?A. No. As far as I know--Q. Please go on.A. As far as I know from my lawyer, this matter was diverted by Berlin,and that is why the second time, on 21 August, I was released again.Q. But then there were other denunciations against you?A. Yes, later on. After I had been released for the first time and whenI was in custody pending trial for the second time, only then was thissermon brought to the knowledge of the [Nuernberg] Special Court.Q. It seems that you were also denounced by the Ortsgruppenleiter forother activities.A. Well, no, I was not denounced. I was only charged with them andreprimanded, but they had nothing to do with the court.Q. Just a little bit slower, please.A. At Vilseck, I only discharged my general duties as a priest.Q. But your activities at school were talked about and other activitieswhich were not compatible with State directives at that time?A. Well, I have to object to that. That was only the opinion ofStubenvoll. Only in his opinion were those activities against theState. I never violated any State directives in that matter. I onlystuck to my church directives.Q. However, your youth organization and your school activity, what didthey object to in those matters?A. Well, for instance, as far as the pupils of the vocational schoolwere concerned, I gathered them for education after the lessons.The Ortsgruppenleiter Stubenvoll didnt like that, and then he madequite bad and mean difficulties for me. He threatened that I would becharged. Furthermore, I gathered the adult youth every 3 or 4 weeks inorder to have discussions and a little lecture. There again, Stubenvollsent informers, in spite of the fact that he had no right whatsoever tointervene in church matters.Q. You speak of intervening in church matters. Can you confirm thatas a result of the centuries-old tension between church and state inGermany, there were penalties for the misuse of the priests professionwhich were as old and which had been issued centuries ago?A. I know only the Pulpit Article, and that had existed for quitesome time.[544] Otherwise, I dont know anything.Q. Well do you know for instance, the Protizio of common law? You dontknow that?A. No.Q. The Protizio.A. No, I dont know that.Q. But, you know that the Pulpit Article was issued during Bismarcksrule; that is 1871, is that correct?A. Yes. Even during the trial, Rothaug made a remark about it to me.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *Q. Now, on the strength of that sermon at that time, you gave as abasis, chapter 7 of the Matthews Evangelical?A. Yes.Q. Was it the fact that this text was made the basis for this sermonwhich was objected to?A. Well, that could not be objected to because I had no power overthat. I had to take that text.Q. Is it correct if I assume that, of course, the words which youjoined to that chapter were objected to?A. Well, yes. The whole sermon, as I said, was explained by the witnessin a way as if I meant by the false prophets the leading personalitiesof Germany of that day.Q. Did you mean them at that time?A. I spoke in quite a general way, and I left to the people what theywanted to understand from my sermon.Q. Well, did you mean the leading personalities? I would like to knowthat.A. I spoke in a quite general way on these matters of ideology, and Ileft it to everybody. If I meant somebody then, of course, I meant,first of all, Rosenberg who actually was the man who was involved withthe National Socialist ideology versus religion, by his book.Q. In other words, the assumption of the public prosecutor was correct?A. It was an assumption and they couldnt prove it.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *Q. Now, witness, you have admitted that the newspaper distributorGeyer expressly stated that your sermon was very aggressive.A. Yes, the witness Geyer in the minutes taken by the Gestapo hadtestified that, and they had written it down.Q. Also, the wife of the Ortsgruppenleiter, according to your owntestimony, had testified that in church she had objected to what yousaid?A. Yes.Q. Was the wife of the Ortsgruppenleiter a woman who went to churchvery often?A. Yes, relatively she went rather often to church. But one gained theimpression--and also the other people who went to church confirmedthis--that she went to church because she wanted to hear everythingthat was said in church.Q. This woman, did she go to church before the time her husband becamean Ortsgruppenleiter?A. Yes, also during that period already, Frau Stubenvoll went to churchregularly.Q. And now you assume that this woman suddenly went to church only asan informer?A. That was the general opinion in the village; it was not only myopinion.Q. You have admitted that when Rothaug questioned this woman hegenerally stuck to what she had testified before the Gestapo, that is,as a line for his questioning.A. Yes.Q. Furthermore, you said that he asked leading questions?A. He submitted it to her in a way that she could only answer yes orno in a very easy way. That was the impression the public gained. Myfamily was there partly.Q. However, this woman had already told all that. How can you say thatRothaug put leading questions to that woman and told her what she wasto say?A. Because in her testimony she was rather uncertain.Q. Why did she suddenly get uncertain in her answers if she had alreadytold the Gestapo the very same things?A. Between the questioning by the Gestapo in August and the questioningduring the trial in December there was quite a period of time, and FrauStubenvoll didnt have a good memory of what she had stated at thattime. This impression my defense counsel gained, also.Q. In other words, the first statements of this woman were apparentlyunder the impression of your sermons, werent they?A. Well, only what she may have stated to the Gestapo. During thetrial, from her own knowledge, she didnt speak too much. She onlyanswered.Q. Did you ever see a witness who does anything else than answerquestions?A. Well, the first witness, Stubenvoll--he just spoke and he toldand reported everything he knew against me though he didnt get anyquestions to that effect at all.Q. But this man probably, on the strength of the Code of CriminalProcedure was summoned to explain what he knew. Can you remember that?A. I cannot remember well whether he was summoned to do just that. Hestarted to speak against me.Q. Now, you mentioned the fact that Rothaug had alleged that in yourtender youth your parents had forgotten to give you the education of aNational Socialist.A. At that time I was much older, but indirectly this came as a hintconcerning my parents, and my brother confirmed that to me and theyoung lady who attended the trial, that he even hinted at my parentsjust when he spoke of education, of education from the tender youthonward.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *Q. Witness, the entire question of the burial of the Pole was mentionedonly because, apparently, it was contained in the files, and there itwas used as further evidence of your attitude of opposition to theState?A. These files, however, had nothing to do with the actual mattercharged in the trial.Q. However, it was further evidence of your entire attitude toward theState at that time?A. Yes, that is how the presiding judge interpreted it and alsoexpressed it.Q. How long did the whole trial take?A. From about 8 oclock until 1:30 in the afternoon.DR. KOESSL: I have no further questions. Thank you.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *EXAMINATION BY THE TRIBUNALPRESIDING JUDGE MARSHALL: I understand that your testimony nowis that the sermon referred to in your testimony was preached on thethird Sunday in July of the year 1941. Is that correct?WITNESS SCHOSSER: I can now tell you the exact date. It was 20July 1941.Q. I understand you to say that from the time of the preaching of thatsermon a period of 15 months elapsed during which nothing happened. Isthat correct?A. Fifteen months passed until the trial. About a year later there wasthe denunciation because of this transfer of the Pole.Q. About a year elapsed, then, before you were arrested, and then 3 or4 months after that until the trial took place, is that correct?A. Yes, that is how it was.PRESIDING JUDGE MARSHALL: Very well.MR. WOOLEYHAN: May the witness be excused, Your Honor?PRESIDING JUDGE MARSHALL: The witness may be excused.           EXTRACTS FROM THE TESTIMONY OF DEFENDANT ROTHAUG                CONCERNING THE CASE OF FATHER LUITPOLD                             SCHOSSER[545]_DIRECT EXAMINATION_       *       *       *       *       *DR. KOESSL (counsel for defendant Rothaug): I want to talkto you about the Schosser case, S-c-h-o-s-s-e-r. The Schosser caseis mentioned in the English transcript on page 1743 by the witnessFerber;[546] and in the English transcript on page 3021 through 3066by the witness Schosser. Witness, in this case the main charge againstyou is that you displayed special initiative. In addition to that thecharge is made repeatedly that Schosser was prosecuted because heburied a Pole. Between what proceedings does one have to distinguishwhen the name Schosser is mentioned?DEFENDANT ROTHAUG: This is a case of two proceedings, in fact.The first case had to do with the funeral of a Pole, but I want tostate right now that naturally the funeral itself was not considereda punishable offense. That is the more recent case. Then, anotherproceeding is of importance here which has to do with the sermon on aSunday in church. That case, the first case, in connection with thefuneral of a Pole did not lead to a main trial or a sentence, but thissermon on the Sunday did. Those are the first things between which onehas to distinguish, because in this connection the charge is made thatI had started or initiated the second case after I had failed withthe first one; and my aim is now to prove to the Court by submittingevidence, submitting documents, that I was not the initiator in thiscase, and in general, I object against that charge.Q. Did you also deal with the first case that you find in the filebefore you? Look at page 6 of the file attached to the main file. It isthe case SG-948, from 1942.A. There are two cases, and it would probably be helpful to mentionthe file designations to avoid confusion. The first case--the case ofthe funeral of the Pole, if you want to call it that--has the filedesignation 1-C SG 948, from the year 1942.Q. What was the cause for that case?A. That case was initiated on the basis of a denunciation which theKreisleiter of Amberg on 12 June 1942 sent to the public prosecutorat the Special Court Nuernberg-Fuerth. In this report it is set forththat, by the behavior of the accused Schosser in church, particularlyby making an announcement about the funeral, and by guiding people tothe cemetery, the German population to a far-reaching extent was causedto attend the funeral; and that that behavior was considered an offenseagainst the measures which were prevailing at the time concerning theseparation between Germans and Polish people.Q. What did the senior public prosecutor do?A. In this connection it may be necessary to point out that there wasa definite regulation which I find in the official gazette for thediocese at Regensburg, published by the bishops office, Regensburg.In this publication, periodical, is a reprint of a decree, an officialdecree, concerning the spiritual care of civilian workers of Polishnationality employed in Germany. The bishops office reprints thatdecree by the Reich Defense Commissioner in the defense districts 7and 13. Our area was in that district and this was published for theinformation of the priests. The decree deals in detail with everythingthat had to be done. Figure 5 is of importance. It says that theinterment of Polish civilian workers, male or female, can be taken careof by German priests. Participation of the German population has to bereduced to the absolutely necessary minimum. No sermon may be held.That decree contains eight sections. I do not know if the remainderis interesting to the Tribunal. I could just refer to them if it isdesired.Q. If the Court is interested, will you please refer to them.PRESIDING JUDGE BRAND: You may.DEFENDANT ROTHAUG: First, on figure 1, it is stated thatparticipation of civilian workers of Polish nationality in the churchservices of the German population is prohibited. Then it is stipulatedthat church services for Polish workers, male or female, have tobe conducted separately. Where there arent enough Poles living,individual spiritual care is permitted, but under all circumstances itshould be avoided that Poles and Germans should be together in the sameroom for that purpose. Services should only be conducted in the Germanor the Latin language. Publication of newspapers, periodicals, orSunday magazines in the Polish language is prohibited. The priests hadto restrict themselves just to the spiritual care of the Polish people.It ends with the words as follows: It is expected that the Germanpriests should always be conscious of being Germans and of the dutiesarising from that fact and that offenses will be punishable.DR. KOESSL: Was it made clear whether Schosser knew anythingabout that regulation?DEFENDANT ROTHAUG: That, at first, could not be seen from thereport received, but after he was interrogated, he referred to the factthat he had not known anything about all these circumstances and thatthat was what had got him into this trouble.Q. Now, we want to find out what happened after that report was made.A. It is first asserted here that I had commissioned Ferber, or thatI had told Ferber that he should issue an arrest warrant, but Ferberhad told me that he did not know what reasons to give for it and thatsubsequently I had handled the matter myself with a vicious remark andhad issued the arrest warrant. The background history of that arrestwarrant seems very dubious, but I dont think it necessary to enterinto that. On 15 June 1942 I issued the arrest warrant and that arrestwarrant was based upon article 2, paragraph 1 of the insidious actslaw, and article 130a of the Penal Code. In the case of this article130a of the Penal Code, we were concerned with the so-called PulpitArticle, the offense of abusing the pulpit. It is of importance thatthat article alone which would have supported the proceedings, isa regulation which has nothing to do with national socialism, butis an article which emanates from Bismarcks time, the time of theKulturkampf [cultural struggle] in Germany, and the then liberaldemocracy factions in Germany brought it about against clericalism.This concept is found in article 130a. The arrest as far as factswere concerned was not based upon the circumstances that Schosserconducted that funeral for the Pole, but because as one could assume,and certainly can assume today, but on his knowledge of the Germanregulations and provisions and on announcing the intended funeral, andthe transfer of the body from the morgue to the cemetery in order topersuade the German population to a far-reaching extent to participate,and therefore, to indirectly demonstrate its opposition against theregulations of the State. The funeral itself is not a matter for thechurch, but a matter for the State for the government of Germany,and the clergymen are only permitted to participate in the funeral,and to perform the duties commensurate with religious custom, to saythe prayers, and everything that belongs with it. But the funeralwas actually carried out by the municipal office. The discussion ofsuch a matter and the announcement, conscious of the fact that itwould cause a disturbance among the population, that was against theprovisions of article 130a; and if this is connected with the intentionto demonstrate opposition against measures of the State, which wascertainly the case here, then the prerequisites required by law arecomplied with, and I do not know of anything further to investigate;but if all these elements are there, I have the obligation to issue thearrest warrant, and on that basis I did.Q. Now, the witness Schosser has pointed out that he had already beenarrested by the Gestapo, and that at that time he had been punished; hehad been sentenced to 14 days. Can you determine from the files whetheryou issued the warrant of arrest before you knew of the police measuresagainst Schosser?A. From the files it can be seen without doubt that when I issued thewarrant of arrest, I did not know anything about the occurrences at theGestapo office of Regensburg which found its climax in the protectivecustody imposed upon Schosser for 14 days. That can be seen from thefollowing.Q. When did you receive information about that from the Gestapo?A. I was just going to say that because you have already asked me. On15 June 1942 the prosecution sent the arrest warrant to the SecretState Police at Regensburg. Subsequently, on 18 June 1942 the SecretState Police Regensburg replied with the information that it did notwant to carry out the arrest at that time because a police measurewas imposed, that is to say, the protective custody for 14 days onSchosser and returned the files together with the arrest warrant tothe senior public prosecutor and that is the way he was informed inconnection with that funeral. The Secret State Police already had takenmeasures. I was not informed about these facts, as can be seen from thefile. Just the same, that arrest warrant was carried out, and that wasjustified.PRESIDING JUDGE BRAND: May I ask you a question. Would youtell us in a few words the specific provision of the insidious acts lawwhich was violated in this case? I dont understand that.DEFENDANT ROTHAUG: That was article 2, section 1. I can readit if you think it is desirable; I can quote it if you think it isdesirable.PRESIDING JUDGE BRAND: I would like to hear that if it isbrief; I havent it before me.DEFENDANT ROTHAUG: This is the provision. Schosser--DR. KOESSL: Give the legal provisions, Witness.DEFENDANT ROTHAUG: Yes, that is what it is. It is suspectedthat Schosser made vicious remarks in public, derogatory remarksabout the leadership of the State, the NSDAP, its provisions andinstitutions--Q. Witness, will you please read the insidious acts law itself--ratherthan--A.--which are designed to undermine the confidence of the people in theleadership. In connection with that I want to mention that we alwaysinclude the actual text of the law in the arrest warrant.PRESIDING JUDGE BRAND: Give me the date of that law, please?DR. KOESSL: The insidious acts law.DEFENDANT ROTHAUG: The insidious acts law is of 20 December1934; 20 December 1934.[547]PRESIDING JUDGE BRAND: That is all.DR. KOESSL: And now will you please tell us--DEFENDANT ROTHAUG: The law speaks of statements, but the sameapplies to behavior which permitted a conclusion, that is to say an actwhich looked at on its own merits may be correct, but by the evaluationwhich it is given by others, may have the character of a malicious act.I have also explained that we were not informed about these matters.The defendant was arrested and was questioned before the local court inWeiden.Q. Did he do anything about his arrest?A. He filed a complaint against the arrest, he filed a complaintagainst the arrest warrant; a decision was made.Q. About that appeal, did you have anything to do with that decision?A. That decision was formally not correct, but substantially it is veryinteresting because by that decision the complaint against my arrestwarrant was rejected; and rejected by the one person who now chargesme with having issued that arrest warrant. That was signed--it happensto be signed by Mr. Ferber, who asserts that I had pulled a dirty dealwith my arrest warrant.Q. You yourself had nothing to do with that decision?A. I had nothing to do with that decision; the case went on and wassoon suspended after the defendant had been interrogated, and thatwas one thing we didnt know when we issued the arrest warrant, heexplained that for quite some time he was in the army, and it wasgranted him that he might not have been as well informed about theentire atmosphere around the question of Poles in Germany as one wouldhave expected otherwise. The case was suspended on 27 August 1942, withthe reason that it could not be proved that the defendant intended todemonstrate his opposition against the measures of the State concerningPoles.Q. You have been charged that because that case was not successful, youhad initiated a second proceeding, the one concerning the sermon. Willyou please, first state what the prosecution had decided already on 9July 1942, that is to say, before the end of the first proceeding. Youfind it on page 12 of the files, a disposition made by the prosecutionon 9 July.A. That is the worst part of the charges which are raised against mein this connection. As I have said, I can refute it by documents,by just mentioning several documents in chronological order whichwill clarify the connections. In the file concerned with the funeralof the Pole, on page 12, 9 July 1942, there is a short dispositionon the part of the prosecutor where he requests a list of previousconnections and political record. Therefore, for that funeral case, onewanted to have the political record of Schosser from the Party. Theprosecutor shouldnt have done that really, but he was new there, andhe committed that blunder, and that was how the whole thing started. Itwas prohibited to request any political record of a clergyman becauseone considered--one knew generally that the clergy was against nationalsocialism; that was no secret; but now in spite of that, the Partyreacted upon that request and sent a certificate of that kind, not tome, but to the prosecutor who requested it.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *Q. What was the course of the second case, the case of the sermon? Inthat case, serious charges were also made against you concerning thetreatment of the clergyman Schosser. Will you briefly describe thecourse of those proceedings, and will you please state whether the partyou took in that case justifies the charge of being the main instigatorleveled against you?A. In the further course of the proceedings that charge cannot beconsidered since the proceedings were already started when the casecame before me. On 25 August 1942, I issued the arrest warrant. We didnot go as far at that time as the confession or the statements made bySchosser in the trial would have permitted us to go. If we had assumedthat his entire sermon from beginning to end was directed against thewolves in sheeps clothing, we could have characterized the case as oneof high treason, and we would have had to pass it on for that reasonto the competent authority. We only assumed that in the course of thesermon various doubtful statements had been made which had nothing todo with God the Father, and that was how it came to trial.Nothing further happened. Investigations were carried out such as inevery other case, and there was a defense counsel.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *Q. Now we want to continue; where did the session take place in thesecond case?A. In the town hall court at Amberg.Q. What parts of the population attended that session?A. All categories of people. The court room was right in the center ofthe town and when people had found out that there was something goingon, they just came.Q. What was the composition of these people, according to theirdenominations?A. The great majority of the population was Catholic.Q. Did you have to take certain considerations on account of that?A. Of course. One had to avoid anything which could hurt the religiousfeelings of these people. Cases against clergymen required a greatdeal of caution and a great deal of tact so that no wrong impressionswere made, because it was generally considered undesirable to make theimpression, in any way, that it was intended to injure the religiousfeelings of these people.Q. What, in brief, were the charges against Schosser and how did hedefend himself against them?A. The charges did not refer to the entire sermon, the subject of whichwas false prophets, but two basic thoughts were mentioned. For one, thethought that the leading individuals--meaning in the State--intendedto take the Catholic faith from the people. In addition to that,the defendant also was charged with having attacked the principleprevailing in Germany of religious freedom. That was the charge.Q. Schosser asserts that his sermon itself was really not the focusof interest; but that you had dealt emphatically with the matter of afuneral, and you had included that in the case. Is that correct?A. The matter of the funeral was not the subject of the indictment sofar as it was not considered a basis for any legal facts in connectionwith it, but it was merely mentioned in the course of the trial. It iscorrect that this matter was discussed in connection with the matterscontained in the indictment, but not in the manner that it was the mostimportant part of the trial. It was quite legally admissible to mentionit, as I have mentioned.Q. Can you prove, from the files, that the prosecution submitted thefiles concerning the sermon question to the court?A. That can be seen from the file.PRESIDING JUDGE BRAND: Is that file in evidence?MR. WOOLEYHAN: No, Your Honor, it is not.DR. KOESSL: The case was only discussed by the witnessSchosser.DEFENDANT ROTHAUG: By an order in the file SG 948 from theyear 1942 (matter of the funeral), the prosecutor decided on 27 August1942, under III, Filed without subsidiary file, that the matter SD1312 of 1942--that is the sermon matter--after that file had beenreturned, was to be attached. By way of that disposition, these filesconcerning the funeral were submitted by the prosecution as materialevidence, together with the sermon file, with the consequence thatI received that material and had to discuss it with the prosecutionwitness at the main trial. That was legally permitted at all times. Thejudge was authorized to touch upon matters which had become either thesubject of amnesty, or where an acquittal had occurred, or on mattersreferring to cases that had been suspended, or where a sentence hadbeen passed. He could touch upon all these matters in a different caseand discuss them for the purposes of the case at hand. Whether thatbecame the basis for an evaluation for that new trial--that, of course,could only evolve from that main trial and the discussions therein.Q. What was the basic purpose of discussing that question on your part?A. The fundamental purpose of discussing these matters was to specifythe obligation that all individuals and all offices had to heed themeasures and regulations issued by the State, and the final purpose wasto establish what basic attitude the defendant himself had with regardto that problem.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *Q. Schosser says you had attacked him on account of his profession, andyou had attacked, in fact, the entire clerical profession. What was itabout these alleged attacks?A. That just isnt so. As was required for every case, theinterrogation was a conversation between myself and the defendant and,in the course of that conversation, I went into the question thatpeople, if they wanted to go to church, wanted to hear about heavenlymatters and didnt want to hear anything about politics. If he wantedto deal with questions of that kind, he shouldnt have become aclergyman but a politician.Q. In connection with the education of youth, you are supposed tohave reproached him that in the house of his parents, he hadnt beeneducated in the National Socialistic sense.A. That kind of a conversation would have been straight nonsensebecause Schosser was born in 1909 and, at that time, there was no suchthing as national socialism. Consequently, I could not blame him. * * *.PRESIDING JUDGE BRAND: We understand your answer.DR. KOESSL: It is also asserted that you reproached him thatthe Catholics were saying that Protestants were going right to hell.Quite briefly, please.DEFENDANT ROTHAUG: That again was an entirely differentthought. I set forth that the German State has two great denominationsand many others and can, therefore, be neither Catholic or Protestantbut only absolutely neutral. It was, of course, up to him personallyin his clerical field to speak for the accuracy of his opinion and hisfaith. If you are of the opinion that all those who are of a differentdenomination will go to hell, it is impossible for the State to sharethat opinion. As far as we are concerned, everybody will go right toheaven.Q. Another question, quite briefly. Will you tell us what was saidabout Rosenberg?[548]A. The name Rosenberg was brought in in the following manner. Schosserhimself referred to it because his line of defense was that he had notintended to attack the Party by his statements but new [religious]ideas [neopaganism] and that he particularly intended to turn againstRosenberg with his statements. Thereupon, I told him that at any timeit was his right to refute the thoughts which Rosenberg developed inhis book, Myths of the 20th Century, in his sermons and to prove thatthey were wrong, only he had to specify what he intended to refuteand whom he intended to refute because that, of course, was the mostimportant thing of the trial. He had to exclude any possibility thatthese things might be carried into the general political field. Thatwas the basis for my thoughts.Q. Under what provisions was Schosser sentenced?A. On the basis of article 130a of the Criminal (Penal) Code andarticle 2 of the Insidious Acts Law,[549] that is to say, according toGerman law both provisions became applicable; as we would have saidtechnically, there was a sort of a legal connection between the twolaws.Q. Would Schosser have been punishable if there hadnt been anInsidious Act Law?A. Of course, on the basis of article 130a.Q. As far as the facts are concerned, had the case Schosser been dealtwith leniently or severely?A. As far as the facts were concerned, it had been dealt with mostleniently because the basis of suspicion was that the entire sermonof the false prophets and the roving wolves in all its structure andtendency was a political attack against the government. Schosser, whenhe was heard here as a witness, more or less admitted that. In ourevaluation, however, we did not go that far, but we only referred tothese two basic attacks.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *             EXTRACT FROM THE TESTIMONY OF DEFENDANT KLEMM                CONCERNING PROSECUTION EXHIBIT 291 AND                  LIMITATIONS ON DIVINE SERVICES[550]_DIRECT EXAMINATION_DR. SCHILF (counsel for defendant Klemm): The prosecution inthis connection submitted another document, Prosecution Exhibit 291,that is Document NG-770.[551] It deals with the problem whether churchservices could be held in penal institutions. I ask you whether you hadanything to do with that matter?DEFENDANT KLEMM: Yes, and I remember it quite well becauseI had a rather hot argument with Thierack about that matter.[552]Thierack, without informing me, prohibited that any church servicescould be held in penal institutions. I found out about thatdirective through the _Deutsche Justiz_--the periodical forGerman Justice--of 1944, on page 270. I immediately went to Thierackand referred to ethical reasons, but he did not abstain from hisintentions. Then I used stronger arguments. I told him that I knew fromthe period of my work in the Party Chancellery that Hitler himself hadissued a strict order that during the war all measures which mightcause struggles with the church should be abstained from. Thierackdoubted that. I offered that I would get a written confirmation fromthe Party Chancellery about that. He forbade that I write to the PartyChancellery. I told him in the course of the conversation that I wasquite sure what the outcome of that matter would be. The moment onebishop would turn to Hitler, Hitler on account of his basic attitudewould disavow Thierack.A short time later when letters were received from German bishops,from the Protestant side as well as from the Catholic side, I went toThierack and he became rather thoughtful and agreed to rescind theformer order. That happened in a very carefully stated form, but itactually occurred. Especially for that matter, I claim a certain amountof credit.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *VI. FINAL STATEMENTS OF THE DEFENDANTS[553]PRESIDING JUDGE BRAND: The record will show that thedefendants have already had the opportunity to testify at length underoath, and they are now accorded the privilege, in each instance, ofmaking an unsworn statement for the benefit of the Tribunal.We will hear the first defendant, Dr. Schlegelberger.DEFENDANT SCHLEGELBERGER: These words of Pope Gregor VII areworld-famous: I loved justice and hated arbitrariness; therefore, Idie in exile.I feel confident that your judgment will save me from that fate. ButI, too, in imprisonment, could not overcome the bitterness of beingrewarded for my hard struggle for justice by this period of shame andmisery. The charges and insults of the prosecutor do not apply to me.My life is not compatible with the intention of crime. The attemptto destroy the alleged myth around my person by showering abuse ata man who has aged honorably was bound to fail. The Goering affairhas been cleared up as completely unexceptionable. The connectionbetween it, my draft of a law, and my resignation is based on a freelyinvented malicious construction which lacks all foundation. In spiteof my advanced age my defense was easy for me. All I had to do was totell the Tribunal the truth. I have done so in the firm convictionthat truth will be victorious and with the undaunted pride of a clearconscience.PRESIDING JUDGE BRAND: The defendant Klemm may address theCourt.DEFENDANT KLEMM: The prosecution has endeavored to show thatI am not worthy of credibility. In long winded arguments it endeavorsto connect a very few apparently positive points by combinationswhich lack all foundation, both in factual and political respect.Distortions and arbitrary additions have to serve this purpose. Inthe case of Sonnenburg it is said that Hecker had stated that Hansenhad said that Klemm did not feel comfortable in connection with thismatter. Not a word to this effect is to be found in the transcript ofHeckers testimony. Although, in cross-examination, Hecker clearlycould not maintain the agreement as he described it in his affidavit,the prosecution maintains the agreement, although its own witness,Eggensperger, denied it as well. And now another final example.Heydrichs directives to his police agencies to take Jewish womeninto protective custody is presented by the prosecution as beingan agreement with the judicial administration. There are many moreexamples. But please let me say only the following with regard to whatthe prosecution stated this morning. Due to the propaganda of theState, we were convinced at the outbreak of the war that justice wason our side. A dictatorship could not and does not permit its cards tobe shown. And, finally, we are not here charged with crimes againstpeace. To what Mr. King said regarding Prosecution Exhibit 252,[554]let me state the following: The list of 17 January 1945, containingreports on death sentences, deals with a list of the Minister, for itcontains doubtful cases, and from that I gathered that it could notbe my list after I had also seen from the photostat that there wereseveral dates on the top of the list. Even if both lists should be from1945, the same applies as with regard to the lists on pages 154 through157 in document book 3-L, according to which separate reports weremade to me on individual cases and to the Minister on death sentences.If the prosecution bases its case on the testimony of the witnessAltmeyer, this testimony has been refuted with overwhelming clarity bythe testimony of Hartmann, Franke, and Ehrhard, and the prosecutionoverlooks that, in his cross-examination, the witness Altmeyer, inparticular had to deviate from his affidavit. The prosecution mentionedfurthermore a case of theft from airmen where proceedings were quashed.I remember the case distinctly. An airplane had been destroyed, andfrom the wreck objects had been stolen which had already been partlydestroyed by rain and fire. The proceedings were stopped because thesubjective prerequisites of theft could not be proved. The prosecutionhas failed to show what this theft from a wrecked airplane had to dowith lynching of aviators. All in all, the result of the statements ofthe prosecution is as follows: In this trial it was not only Germanjustice of the past years that was indicted, but the continental legalsystem, a system in which for many decades the obedience to the law andthe norm created by the State has been the only task of the jurist.Before 1933 I had been educated and trained in this school of thought.What legal and factual opportunities were open to me I used in favorof justice wherever I could do so. To revoke laws and norms which hadexisted for years was not in my competency.PRESIDING JUDGE BRAND: The defendant Rothenberger may addressthe Tribunal.DEFENDANT ROTHENBERGER: I was a National Socialist, and inthat respect I distinguish myself from those who for 10 years andmore were placed in leading positions in the Third Reich and todaysay that they were not National Socialists. When I realized thatnational socialism was destroying the very values for which I hadlived and for which it had promised to work, I decided with all myenergy to influence the development of national socialism in the sphereof justice. I did not want to be a hanger-on. It was not my way tocontent myself with tactical maneuvers or withdrawals, which graduallybrought about an undermining of the administration of German justice.The struggle for the idea of the judiciary within the framework of atotalitarian state I made the focal point of my life. And, therefore,I consider myself to be under an obligation to declare today that theGerman judge and his judgment, since 1933, were subjected to excessiveattacks from the Party and from the SS without being given any backingfrom the leadership of the Ministry. Here lie the causes for myactions. At the beginning, I believed that in a totalitarian statethere could exist a free judiciary. In the course of time I realizedthat most of the Party leaders, and in particular the SS leaders,found the very essence of the judiciary an obstacle in their way. Idid not wish it to be true that there should be no way to save myFatherland from such a dangerous development and therefore I clung toHitler. In so doing I found myself in the company of many clever peoplein all spheres of human activity in Germany and abroad. As to whethermy reform of the administration of justice has been rightly called bythe prosecution a Nazi reform which--it is true--called itself NationalSocialist, but which aimed at excluding the influence of the SS and theParty from the administration of justice, and which contains not oneword against Jews or foreigners, but on the contrary claimed the entireadministration of penal justice, including that for foreigners andJews, for the judiciary--with confidence I leave it to the Tribunal todecide that question.I do not ignore today that my life work which has eaten up my nervousstrength was bound to fail; nor do I ignore that my aims were, attimes, in contradiction to the practice of life and also my ownattitude, but is it not always like that in the life of human beingsthat just because there are such abuses and just because at times onesself is weak, one takes that very circumstance for a cause to setup postulates which serve as aim and direction, but which we cannotimmediately, particularly in wartime, put into effect, since the powerof conditions is stronger than ourselves. And how far the power of theSS and the Party had extended I realized as late as 1942 when I cameto Berlin and got an insight into conditions in the Reich. That Hitlerhimself was a despot and that he coupled me together with a man whoshowed himself to be a tool, without any will of his own, of Himmlerand Bormann, that was my tragic misfortune.I had to experience one set-back after the other. At the very beginningof my work I was compromised in the whole of the Reich by the wellknown SD report of Himmlers in October 1942, which prophesied that Iwould soon resign, and the only positive point which kept me was thehope and the confidence of the German judges.There are only two charges of the prosecution which they made in theirfinal plea that I want to answer now. How can the prosecution from myspeeches in Hamm and Lueneburg, of the latter of which the text doesnot even exist, conclude that I was in favor of exterminating theJews? Both speeches exclusively relate to degenerate and incorrigiblecriminals. In the usage of the German language, they are antisocialelements and for those elements I demanded, according to anotherprosecution document, a judicial authority. And the second charge isthat I am a liar. The Jewish pogrom in 1938, they say, had been onquite a different scale in Hamburg from the way I had described it. Asto how the Jewish question was handled in Hamburg you can see clearlynot only from a prosecution document but also from the affidavit bythe man whom the British, after the surrender, appointed Lord Mayor ofHamburg. I am speaking of Mayor Petersen who is half-Jewish himself.That in my struggle I was placed in outward contact with wrong, thatlay in the very nature of things. I assume responsibility for everyaction of my own. The consequences which are now borne by the wholeGerman people justify the fact that former leading personalities alsobear the consequences. But I am of the opinion that crimes which werecommitted by my greatest enemies behind my back cannot be held againstme. As soon as I heard of them I drew the consequences.After 16 months, in 1943, Himmler, Thierack, and Bormann finally mademe unemployed. I was 47 years old at the time. Without overestimatingthe power of my personality, the road for the wishes of those men,concerning the administration of German justice, now lay open.PRESIDING JUDGE BRAND: Defendant Lautz may now address thecourt.DEFENDANT LAUTZ: At the beginning of the prosecutions oralpresentation, the chief prosecutor emphasized that the roles which thedefendants are assigned in these proceedings are new for them. That istrue, as far as this refers to the position which we now have to holdbefore this Tribunal. Apart from that, we public prosecutors are quitefamiliar with the role of defendants in criminal proceedings. A manlike myself who, in 25 long years, became acquainted with the fate ofmen in prisons, in courtrooms, in penal institutions, and on the way tothe place of execution, knows very well the tragedy of this role andone who, under the official robe, has preserved a human heart, will thebetter recognize that not blind zeal for prosecution, but much ratherwisdom coupled with human understanding are best designed to serve theaim of true judicial administration.The German public prosecutors in their overwhelming majority recognizedthis also in the Third Reich. Therefore, none of the charges madeagainst me here I feel to be more unjust than that, by filing maliciousindictments, I had done injustice for the sake of injustice. I trust,however, that these proceedings have shown how unjust this charge is.The office of a public prosecutor is a very hard one. It is easierin peace than in wartime, but it became incredibly difficult duringa war which is without example in history and which has left ourFatherland--which also meant everything to us public prosecutors--inruins.PRESIDING JUDGE BRAND: Defendant Mettgenberg may address theTribunal.DEFENDANT METTGENBERG: Your Honors. Novel, alien, andunaccustomed as it was to the previous speaker, so it is to me thesituation in which I have found myself for months as a prisoner in thedock; and that is what the prosecution said when this trial opened,novel, alien, and unaccustomed were to me many things in this trialwhich concludes today.All the same I, for my part, have tried to make my contribution to thecorrect carrying out of these proceedings; with complete frankness Ihave described my past career, and I have given you my views concerningthe points with which the prosecution has charged me. There is nothingI have to hide.Now at the end of this trial the prosecution deemed it necessary, Ibelieve without regard to the evidence, to ask of you that you shouldconvict me for having committed war crimes. It may be that you willconvict me for having committed war crimes. It may be that that is theduty of the prosecution. It is not for me to arrive at a judgment aboutthat. The prosecution must take the responsibility for their motion.My defense counsel has asked you to acquit me. I too ask you toacquit me, but Your Honors, I ask you for more than that. As far asI am informed, it is in accordance with your legal views to acquit adefendant if there is a reasonable doubt about his guilt. I am of theopinion, and please do not think me arrogant, that I may expect you tofind that there is no reasonable doubt as to my innocence. Even aftercareful and conscientious examination, such as I have given to my ownpast, I believe I am justified in making this request.PRESIDING JUDGE BRAND: The defendant von Ammon may address theTribunal.DEFENDANT VON AMMON: I have nothing to add to the statementsmade by me on 1 and 4 August under oath in the witness box.PRESIDING JUDGE BRAND: Defendant Joel may address the Tribunal.DEFENDANT JOEL: I wish to remain silent.PRESIDING JUDGE BRAND: Defendant Rothaug may address theTribunal.DEFENDANT ROTHAUG: Prosecutor King in his final plea mentioneda death sentence passed by a French court against a president of acourt in Strasbourg. May I refer to the fact that this involves aso-called _in absentia_ sentence in which the defendant had noopportunity for his own defense whatsoever, because at that time he wasin a German internment camp and by sheer accident happened to read ofit in a newspaper.I served my country throughout my life and in whatever position I wasassigned to, in faithfulness, with a pure heart, and without malice.Seen from my present position you might consider this wrong, and youcould say I and all those who surrounded me should have been moresuspicious of developments as they took place. This prognosis inretrospect is just as convincing as it is cheap. Nobody in our positionat that time could be of the opinion that the State which we servedcould be accused of being altogether illegal and that the war that itwaged was a war of aggression, as is demonstrated today to all theworld. Therefore, it is no accident and no excuse that, apart fromdefending myself against the flood of personal defamations which Ireceived from the circle of my previous friends and assistants, I amnow anxious to prove to you that both in the service as a judge andprosecutor, I applied the laws of my country in the manner in whichthey were intended, to the best of my conscience and belief. We wereguided by the practice of the Reich Supreme Court and went the sameway which was taken by the remaining 60 to 80 Special Courts in theReich. We were no specialists in crimes against humanity, and no proofhas been furnished in any single case that, in any connection, we hadapplied an illegal method.Thoughts of extermination were not represented in my sphere ofwork, nor did we ever hear anything to the effect that in the fieldof justice they played any part at all. We knew of shootings ofpeople who had been sentenced only to prison terms. That was openlyreported in the newspapers. Apart from that, these proceedingsapplied to four people who, under my presidency, had been sentencedto imprisonment--among them, the Eisenberger case mentioned here. ButI myself only heard of the inner connections of these events wheninternal official files of the public prosecution became accessible tome here. We saw and judged the facts in a different light. The countrywas an area of warfare. I have experienced the terrors of Verdun. Asfar as misery is concerned, it cannot be compared with the effects ofone single air raid, lasting 45 minutes, on the civilian life of thiscity. The principle of war which threatens life itself had been madethe principle of life. We therefore understood, guided by this point ofview, that the laws required harsh proceedings in the case of crimeswhich exploited conditions of war, and that habitual criminals, violentcriminals, and saboteurs of all kinds, in view of the decreasedsecurity of the conditions as they existed in the country, had to beheld down. If, on the other hand, we are told that thereby we hadsupported a war of aggression carried on by our government, then wecan only say we did not know that. Once war had come, the life andexistence of millions of peoples was involved, and we derived therefromthe ethical justification for severity against individuals, whichstood in no proportion to what was at stake. The logical calculationof war in regard to life is that hundreds of thousands of people aresacrificed to save the lives of millions, and this principle wastransferred to the entire public life and in the field of criminal law,this was tied to the concept of guilt. And that was how our work, ouractivity, was understood. If today we are no longer understood, and ifattempts are made today to judge our actions as criminal, this is notvery surprising in view of a world which does not look too far belowthe surface of things. For the catastrophe has made all our actionsappear in the destructive light of in vain. This qualification whichalso has a demoralizing effect, disguises all connections which mightspeak in our favor in the question of humanity. This is the tragedy ofour case, and we are convinced that Your Honors will not fail to see it.PRESIDING JUDGE BRAND: Defendant Barnickel may address theTribunal.DEFENDANT BARNICKEL: May it please the Court. The greatFrenchman Honor de Balzac, for whom I have had a great respect sincethe days of my youth, puts into the mouth of one of his charactersthese words, I believe justice to be a development of a divine ideawhich is suspended above the world. That idea, whether one sharesit or not, is certainly very beautiful. It remains beautiful even ifjustice does not always reflect its divine origin. We jurists whomfate had condemned to work in the Third Reich--and I am by no meansreferring only to us who are here, I am referring to all of them--weknow what was the matter with the administration of justice in theThird Reich. But in whatever way this administration of justice mayhave worked, I believe one must view it in connection with the fate ofthe German people. Professor Jahrreiss, to whom all of us in this triallistened with interest, once coined the phrase that for decades theGerman people had no longer known normal life. Every single one of usactually experienced that himself. If I may make it more clear from theexample of my own life, I want to read a few sentences from my diaryfor the last time. This is an entry which I made on 9 June 1942, and Iwrote it under the influence of a Swiss novel, the title of which isAmadeus, and I quote:   When I thought about it for longer as to what I liked so much   about Amadeus, this occurred to me, it is peace, the peace in   which these people live, and in which they can develop. Peace   which, to us Germans, has become something quite strange because   since 1914 we have not had it any more. Before that time we,   too, lived in such an atmosphere, but since then we have always   had war, or at least a pressure which was like war. From 1914   to 1918 there was a war on. In 1919 an intermediate phase set   in. From 1920 to 1923 there was the inflation. From 1924 to 1927   there was the deflation. From 1928 to 1929 there was a brief   recovery. From 1930 to 1932 there was a financial crisis and a   continuous political crisis. From 1933 to 1939 the German people   were molded into a new cast by force. From 1939 to 1942 there   was war. From 1942? Still war!   I am 57 years of age today--at that time--18 years of that   were the years of my youth; 28 years were war years. For   11 years there was a real life. And these were the years   of development--of immaturity--years of struggle, years of   suffering and poverty. But in between there were also many happy   hours.That is how I looked at my life at the time. And it was similar forevery average German citizen. Every normal German longed for peace,for peace which had become something quite strange to us, and everyGerman has that longing deep in him, just as I myself--but it was notwithin his power to achieve that peace. We saw it merely like a ghost.But the same fate which individuals have, is the fate of the spiritualinstitutions of their nation. And the administration of justice, too,shared our fate; it, too, was hemmed in in war and political violence,which were foreign to its nature. No wonder that, at the end of thatlast period of 30 years, justice, too, had been wrecked, just asmillions of people and their lives had been wrecked! Let us hope thatfrom that destruction, new life and new culture will develop. For,after all, so far every generation has lived on the ruins which wereleft by its predecessors, and built its houses from those ruins. Letus hope that what we see in Germany at this moment is already part ofreconstruction and no longer of destruction, and also, I hope, thatwe--as Balzac put it--one day again shall be able to believe thatjustice is the development of a divine thought which is suspended abovethe world!PRESIDING JUDGE BRAND: Defendant Petersen may address theTribunal.DEFENDANT PETERSEN: Your Honors, World War I signified adeep cut in the history of the German people. There existed the greatdanger for Germany of being swamped from the East. It was in thehope to prevent this that I joined the NSDAP. Germany was to remainone bulwark against bolshevism, a pillar of Western culture. I onceentertained the great hope that national socialism would contributeits part toward this end. I do not want to describe my disappointment;the way led past stations of terror. In all my actions I was guidedby the ideal of fulfilling my duty and of serving my country. It wassolely my conscience that formed the basis for my actions, irrespectiveof whether I was an officer, SA leader, State counsellor, or onlyan honorary associate judge of the Peoples Court. I have nothingfurther to add to this. My conscience is clear. Therefore, I am calmlyexpecting your verdict.PRESIDING JUDGE BRAND: The defendant Nebelung may address theTribunal.DEFENDANT NEBELUNG: I was a German judge. I followed the lawsof my country and my knowledge and my conscience in passing judgment.Germany has lost the war. If the law of the victors so demands ofyou--I do not believe it does--then you must condemn my actions. Inthis trial the tragedy of the office of the judge has been mentionedfrequently. Is that anything special? Does not every soldier findhimself in the same situation? I, too, have had that experience both asa soldier and as a judge, but not here in prison, not in the dock, butby the gun and on the bench. By that I want to say the tragedy does notlie in the consequences. I do know how to bear the consequences of asentence, for I believe in the words of the German who was both a judgeand a poet, Theodor Storm, One man asks, What will happen next?while the other merely asks, Is that right? And that is how the freeman is distinguished from the serf.PRESIDING JUDGE BRAND: The defendant Cuhorst may address theTribunal.DEFENDANT CUHORST: Your Honors, I have to add the followingbrief words to the final plea of the defense counsel appointed on mybehalf. Indictment and prosecution statements reveal that in theseproceedings I am only _pars pro toto_. The prosecution with itsevidence is unable to prove any charge which would actually apply tome. The prosecution in its final plea has failed to mention a wholeseries of charges in the indictment, and others for the same reason,namely, lack of evidence, it left in abeyance. In presenting itsevidence the prosecution not only ignored my evidence but also its own,in part. What other reasons are there to explain that they submittedin the course of the cross-examination Document No. 983 [_NG-983,Pros. Ex. 570_], which reveals in an account of traveling expensesthat on 21 March 1943 I was absent for weeks in the East on anofficial journey, and at the same time had the witness Eberhard Schwarztestify with alleged full assurance that on 24 March 1943 I was inStuttgart and presided over the case against the foreigner Englert. Theprosecution has submitted the verdict in the case of Untermarchtal, butwhat they said in the indictment about its contents is not containedin the verdict, but just the contrary. This is the type of evidencesubmitted if facts are involved. Only documents, not arguments withmany sources of error, can show the facts.Justice, above all, penal justice, in Germany since 1918 was alwaysconsidered an institution not in accordance with the times due topolitical attacks on its reputation, thus losing its reputation. Inspite of early hopes, also after 1933 this development continued,and it still continues. Neither in 1937 did Guertner protect mypredecessor, nor in 1944 did Thierack protect me. The many stagesof this development pretended to have various good aims, but theyactually had only the one effect--to destroy what we call justice.Contrary, for example, to the profession of a doctor, that of a penaljudge creates only few friends. A man who is acquitted takes hisacquittal for granted. The man who is sentenced, his defense counselconsiders the verdict as unjust or too severe. Confusion caused inthe transitional periods showed this in a particularly conspicuousform. In spite of this dangerous situation for a criminal judge nowaccused of being a criminal himself, no person ever convicted under myjurisdiction has testified against me. Only a judge who is a saint isfree of errors. I never denied mine. The struggle for independence andagainst destructive influences of the time has not left me unscathed.They wanted to eliminate me from the Party and from my profession, andan unfree minister and his accomplices removed me from office. Theprosecution witness against me was quite right who said: He wantedto maintain independence and he did maintain it. Due to the collapseof my Fatherland, I am again involved in struggles. I am involvedin an indictment against judges full of unexpected and excessivecharges. From 1933 to 1944, one side spoke of me as if I were strange,suspiciously mild, unbearable, unsuitable for office, and detrimentalto the Party and so on. Today the strong terms read as follows:Disgusting, exceptionally severe, convinced Nazi, and the like. Alsoin my prison cell which has been my fate for almost 1 year, thoughas a prisoner of war and an army officer I am subject to the GenevaConvention, I accept these reproaches quietly. I have sworn the oathto observe the law independently and to apply it irrespectively of theperson involved. I have duly observed this, and let the consequencesbe whatever they may be. Either time will be able to bear judges whodo not bend themselves or the time is already here which has quitedifferent views. In handling these problems my own case is recedingto the background. The decision concerning the basic questions of theentire problem of the judiciary brings the solution, also for me, ofthe question--Am I as a judge a criminal? Before all the world, andeven where war opponents are concerned, a _judicium parium_ cananswer this tremendous question with one word only, namely, no.PRESIDING JUDGE BRAND: The defendant Oeschey may address theTribunal.DEFENDANT OESCHEY: May it please the Court, what need besaid in my case has been said by my defense counsel, and all that isleft for me is to agree to his statements, to give you the assurancethat I always acted in the belief and in the conviction that I wasdoing right, by obeying the law to which I was subjected and applyingit in the manner in which my conscience told me to. And it is thetruth that it was a matter of conscience for me not to misuse the lawin a criminal way, but to apply it in accordance with the will ofthe legislator, and to grant the offender a proper trial and a justverdict. Therefore, my conscience knows that it is clear of the crimeswith which I am charged.PRESIDING JUDGE BRAND: The defendant Altstoetter may addressthe Tribunal.DEFENDANT ALTSTOETTER: The charges which the prosecution hasraised against me because of my alleged participation in war crimesand crimes against humanity and on account of my capacity as honorarySS leader, do not apply to me. My conscience is free of any guilt. Icertainly do not propose to evade responsibility for my actions. Onthe contrary! These proceedings gave me the possibility to justify myactions before my people--by whom I stand even in these hard days--andbefore the entire world, that is, my actions during the past regime,and particularly so during the period of my activity in the ReichMinistry of Justice, and to prove that I always only served law andjustice. For this reason I have done everything to give the bestcontribution possible in order to bring out the truth in this trialas far as I am concerned. As a witness in these proceedings I havetestified to the truth to the best of my knowledge and belief.The prosecution knows this very well from my own interrogationsduring preliminary proceedings and from the interrogations ofmany collaborators and aides who, however, were not called by theprosecution to appear as witnesses in court. The prosecution knows italso from documents which must be in its possession, but which were notsubmitted in evidence.And, therefore, the fact hurts me all the more that in its final pleathe prosecution designates me as not worthy of credibility. I feelobliged toward myself and also toward my children to protest with allseriousness and with all emphasis against this charge of having lied. Ido not have to fear truth. I hate nothing more than lies. I feel secureonly under the protection of truth, for truth is the sister of justice.But justice on the part of the prosecution must be claimed by me evenif here we are only experimental objects of international law as it isaspired to, and of an embryonic international justice.Furthermore, I feel obliged to refer to the following, let theproceedings result as they may. There is the enormous danger thatGerman justice was shown here in a picture which, even referring tothe time between 1933 and 1945, is not identical with actual facts.I know justice in all its different phases and organizations, and Iknow that German administration of justice up to the very end was thebest administration of the Reich, and I know above all that the Germanjudges, even in hard times and particularly in these hardest times ofall, did their duty for right and justice up to the very end. All thatcould be desired was that the courage which was shown among the Germanjudiciary at those times would have been shown everywhere. Then thedanger could never have arisen that here in this courtroom there mightarise the danger of a false picture of the German judge.                       VII. OPINION AND JUDGMENTMilitary Tribunal III was established on 14 February 1947 under GeneralOrder No. 11, issued by command of the United States Military Governorfor Germany. The indictment was filed with the Secretary General ofMilitary Tribunals on 4 January 1947, and the case was assigned toTribunal III for trial. A copy of the indictment in the German languagewas served upon each defendant at least 30 days before the commencementof the trial. The defendants were arraigned on 17 February 1947, eachdefendant entering a plea of not guilty to all charges preferredagainst him. German counsel selected by the defendants were approved bythe Tribunal and have represented the respective defendants throughoutthe trial.The presentation of evidence in support of the charges was commencedon 6 March 1947 and was followed by evidence for the defendants. Thetaking of evidence was concluded on 13 October 1947. Copies of theexhibits tendered by the prosecution were furnished in the Germanlanguage to the defendants prior to the time of the reception of theexhibits in evidence. The Tribunal has heard the oral testimony of 138witnesses. In addition it has received 641 documentary exhibits forthe prosecution and 1,452 for defendants, many of them of considerablelength. Some affidavits have been presented by the prosecution, butthey are few in comparison with the hundreds offered by the defense.Whenever possible, and in substantially all cases, applications ofdefense counsel for the production in open court of persons who hadmade affidavits in support of the prosecution have been granted and theaffiants have appeared for cross-examination. Affiants for the defensewere cross-examined orally by the prosecution in comparatively fewcases.The defendant Carl Westphal died before the commencement of the trial.On 22 August 1947, the Tribunal entered an order declaring a mistrialas to the defendant, Karl Engert, who has been able to attend courtfor only 2 days since 5 March 1947. The action was rendered necessaryunder the provisions of article IV (_d_) of Military GovernmentOrdinance No. 7, and by reason of the serious and continuing illness ofsaid defendant.The trial was conducted in two languages with simultaneous translationsof German into English and English into German throughout theproceedings.Under Military Government Order of 14 February 1947, the following weredesignated as members of Military Tribunal III: Carrington T. Marshall,presiding judge; James T. Brand, judge; Mallory B. Blair, judge; JustinWoodward Harding, alternate judge. As thus constituted, the Tribunalentered upon trial of the case. On 21 June 1947, General Order No. 52was issued by the Office of Military Government for Germany as follows:          _Pursuant to Military Government Ordinance No. 7_   1. Effective as of 19 June 1947, pursuant to Military   Government Ordinance No. 7, 24 October 1946, entitled   Organization and Powers of Certain Military Tribunals,   JAMES T. BRAND is appointed Presiding Judge of Military   Tribunal III, vice CARRINGTON T. MARSHALL, relieved   because of illness.   2. JUSTIN WOODWARD HARDING, Alternate Judge, is   appointed Judge for Military Tribunal III.          By command of GENERAL CLAY:                                                 C. K. GAILEY                                                 Brigadier General, GSC                                                 Chief of StaffThe trial has been continued before the Tribunal as thus reconstituted.The evidence has been submitted, final arguments of counsel have beenconcluded, and the Tribunal has heard a personal statement from eachdefendant who desired to address it.In rendering this judgment it should be said that the case againstthe defendants is chiefly based upon captured German documents, theauthenticity of which is unchallenged.The indictment contains four counts, as follows:(1) Conspiracy to commit war crimes and crimes against humanity. Thecharge embraces the period between January 1933 and April 1945.(2) War crimes, to wit: violations of the laws and customs of war,alleged to have been committed between September 1939 and April 1945.(3) Crimes against humanity as defined by Control Council Law No. 10,alleged to have been committed between September 1939 and April 1945.(4) Membership of certain defendants in organizations which have beendeclared to be criminal by the judgment of the International MilitaryTribunal in the case against Goering, et al.The sufficiency of count one of the indictment was challenged by thedefendants upon jurisdictional grounds, and on 11 July 1947, theTribunal made and entered the following order:   Count one of the indictment in this case charges that the   defendants, acting pursuant to a common design, unlawfully,   willfully and knowingly did conspire and agree together to   commit war crimes and crimes against humanity as defined in   Control Council Law No. 10, article II. It is charged that the   alleged crime was committed between January 1933 and April 1945.   It is the ruling of this Tribunal that neither the Charter of   the International Military Tribunal nor Control Council Law No.   10 has defined conspiracy to commit a war crime or crime against   humanity as a separate substantive crime; therefore, this   Tribunal has no jurisdiction to try any defendant upon a charge   of conspiracy considered as a separate substantive offense.   Count one of the indictment, in addition to the separate   charge of conspiracy, also alleged unlawful participation in   the formulation and execution of plans to commit war crimes and   crimes against humanity which actually involved the commission   of such crimes. We, therefore, cannot properly strike the whole   of count one from the indictment, but, in so far as count one   charges the commission of the alleged crime of conspiracy as a   separate substantive offense, distinct from any war crime or   crime against humanity, the Tribunal will disregard that charge.   This ruling must not be construed as limiting the force or   effect of article II, paragraph 2, of Control Council Law No.   10, or as denying to either prosecution or defense the right to   offer in evidence any facts or circumstances occurring either   before or after September 1939, if such facts or circumstances   tend to prove or to disprove the commission by any defendant   of war crimes or crimes against humanity as defined in Control   Council Law No. 10.                    _THE JURISDICTIONAL ENACTMENTS_For convenient reference we have attached to this opinion copiesof the London Agreement of 8 August 1945, with the Charter of theInternational Military Tribunal annexed thereto, Control Council LawNo. 10, Military Government Ordinance No. 7, and the indictment, whichare marked respectively Exhibits A, B, C, and D.[555]The indictment alleges that the defendants committed crimes as definedin Control Council Law No. 10, duly enacted by the Allied ControlCouncil. We therefore turn to that law.The Allied Control Council is composed of the authorizedrepresentatives of the four Powers: the United States, Great Britain,France, and the Soviet Union.The preamble to Control Council Law No. 10 is in part as follows:   In order to give effect to the terms of the Moscow Declaration   of 30 October 1943 and the London Agreement of 8 August 1945,   and the Charter issued pursuant thereto and in order to   establish a uniform legal basis in Germany for the prosecution   of war criminals and other similar offenders, * * * the Control   Council enacts as follows:Article I reads in part as follows:   The Moscow Declaration of 30 October 1943 Concerning   Responsibility of Hitlerites for Committed Atrocities and the   London Agreement of 8 August 1945 Concerning Prosecution and   Punishment of Major War Criminals of the European Axis are made   integral parts of this Law. * * *The London Agreement, supra, provides that the Charter of theInternational Military Tribunal (hereinafter called the IMT Charter),shall form an integral part of this agreement. (London Agreement,art. II). Thus, it appears that the indictment is drawn under andpursuant to the provisions of Control Council Law No. 10 (hereinaftercalled C. C. Law 10), that C. C. Law 10 expressly incorporates theLondon Agreement as a part thereof, and that the IMT Charter is a partof the London Agreement.Article II of C. C. Law 10 defines acts, each of which is recognizedas a crime, namely, (_a_) crimes against peace, (_b_) war crimes,(_c_) crimes against humanity, (_d_) membership in criminalorganizations. We are concerned here with categories (_b_), (_c_), and(_d_) only, each of which will receive later consideration.                      _The Procedural Ordinance_C. C. Law 10 provides that--   1. Each occupying authority, within its zone of occupation,   (_a_) shall have the right to cause persons within such   Zone suspected of having committed a crime, including those   charged with crime by one of the United Nations, to be arrested   * * *.          *       *       *       *       *   (_d_) shall have the right to cause all persons so   arrested and charged, * * * to be brought to trial before an   appropriate tribunal. * * *   2. The tribunal by which persons charged with offenses   hereunder shall be tried and the rules and procedure thereof   shall be determined or designated by each Zone Commander for his   respective Zone. * * * Pursuant to the foregoing authority, Ordinance No. 7 was enacted by theMilitary Governor of the American Zone. It provides:                              Article I   The purpose of this Ordinance is to provide for the   establishment of military tribunals which shall have power to   try and punish persons charged with offenses recognized as   crimes in article II of Control Council Law No. 10, including   conspiracies to commit any such crimes. * * *                              Article II   (_a_) Pursuant to the powers of the Military Governor for   the United States Zone of Occupation within Germany and further   pursuant to the powers conferred upon the Zone Commander by   Control Council Law No. 10 and articles 10 and 11 of the Charter   of the International Military Tribunal annexed to the London   Agreement of 8 August 1945 certain tribunals to be known as   Military Tribunals shall be established hereunder.The tribunals authorized by Ordinance No. 7 are dependent uponthe substantive jurisdictional provisions of C. C. Law 10 and arethus based upon international authority and retain internationalcharacteristics. It is provided that the United States MilitaryGovernor may agree with other zone commanders for a joint trial.(Ordinance 7, art. II, par. (_c_).) The Chief of Counsel for WarCrimes, United States, may invite others of the United Nations toparticipate in the prosecution. (Ordinance 7, art. III, par. (_b_).)The Ordinance provides:                              Article X   The determinations of the International Military Tribunal   in the judgments in Case No. 1 that invasions, aggressive   acts, aggressive wars, crimes, atrocities or inhumane acts   were planned or occurred, shall be binding on the tribunals   established hereunder and shall not be questioned except   insofar as the participation therein or knowledge thereof   by any particular person may be concerned. Statements of the   International Military Tribunal in the judgment in Case No.   1 constitute proof of the facts stated, in the absence of   substantial new evidence to the contrary.The sentences authorized by Ordinance No. 7 are made definite only byreference to those provided for by C. C. Law 10. (Ordinance No. 7, Art.XVI).As thus established the Tribunal is authorized and empowered to tryand punish the major war criminals of the European Axis and thoseGerman officers and men and members of the Nazi Party who have beenresponsible for, or have taken a consenting part in, or have aided,abetted, ordered, or have been connected with plans or enterprisesinvolving the commission of the offenses defined in C. C. Law 10.                  SOURCE OF AUTHORITY OF C. C. LAW 10Having identified the instruments which purport to establish thejurisdiction of this Tribunal, we next consider the legal basisof those instruments. The unconditional surrender of Germany tookplace on 8 May 1945.[556] The surrender was preceded by the completedisintegration of the central government and was followed by thecomplete occupation of all of Germany. There were no opposing Germanforces in the field; the officials who during the war had exercisedthe powers of the Reich Government were either dead, in prison, orin hiding. On 5 June 1945 the Allied Powers announced that theyhereby assume supreme authority with respect to Germany, includingall the powers possessed by the German Government, the High Command,and any state, municipal or local government or authority, anddeclared that there is no central government or authority in Germanycapable of accepting responsibility for the maintenance of order, theadministration of the country, and compliance with the requirementsof the victorious powers. The Four Powers further declared that theywill hereafter determine the boundaries of Germany or any part thereofand the status of Germany or of any area at present being a part ofGerman territory.[557]On 2 August 1945 at Berlin, President Truman, Generalissimo Stalin,and Prime Minister Attlee, as heads of the Allied Powers, enteredinto a written agreement setting forth the principles which were togovern Germany during the initial control period. Reference to thatdocument will disclose the wide scope of authority and control whichwas assumed and exercised by the Allied Powers. They assumed supremeauthority and declared that it was their purpose to accomplishcomplete demilitarization of Germany; to destroy the National SocialistParty, to prevent Nazi propaganda; to abolish all Nazi laws whichestablished discrimination on grounds of race, creed, or politicalopinion * * * whether legal, administrative, or otherwise; tocontrol education; to reorganize the judicial system in accordancewith the principles of democracy and of equal rights; to accomplishthe decentralization of the political structure. The agreementprovided that for the time being no central German governmentshall be established. In the economic field they assumed controlof German industry and all economic and financial internationaltransactions.[558] Finally, the Allies reaffirmed their intention tobring the Nazi war criminals to swift and sure justice.It is this fact of the complete disintegration of the government inGermany, followed by unconditional surrender and by occupation of theterritory, which explains and justifies the assumption and exercise ofsupreme governmental power by the Allies. The same fact distinguishesthe present occupation of Germany from the type of occupation whichoccurs when, in the course of actual warfare, an invading army entersand occupies the territory of another state, whose government isstill in existence and is in receipt of international recognition,and whose armies, with those of its allies, are still in the field.In the latter case the occupying power is subject to the limitationsimposed upon it by the Hague Convention and by the laws and customsof war. In the former case (the occupation of Germany) the AlliedPowers were not subject to those limitations. By reason of the completebreakdown of government, industry, agriculture, and supply, they wereunder an imperative humanitarian duty of far wider scope to reorganizegovernment and industry and to foster local democratic governmentalagencies throughout the territory.In support of the distinction made, we quote from two recent andscholarly articles in The American Journal of International Law.   On the other hand, a distinction is clearly warranted between   measures taken by the Allies prior to destruction of the German   Government and those taken thereafter. Only the former need   be tested by the Hague Regulations, which are inapplicable to   the situation now prevailing in Germany. Disappearance of the   German State as a belligerent entity, necessarily implied in the   Declaration of Berlin of 5 June 1945, signifies that a true   state of war--and hence _belligerent_ occupation--no longer   exists within the meaning of international law.[559]       *       *       *       *       *Through the subjugation of Germany the outcome of the war has beendecided in the most definite manner possible. One of the prerogativesof the Allies resulting from the subjugation is the right to occupyGerman territory at their discretion. This occupation is, both legallyand factually, fundamentally different from the belligerent occupationcontemplated in the Hague Regulations, as can be seen from thefollowing observations.The provisions of the Hague Regulations restricting the rights of anoccupant refer to a belligerent who, favored by the changing fortunesof war, actually exercises military authority over enemy territory andthereby prevents the legitimate sovereign--who remains the legitimatesovereign--from exercising his full authority. The Regulations drawimportant legal conclusions from the fact that the legitimate sovereignmay at any moment himself be favored by the changing fortunes ofwar, reconquer the territory, and put an end to the occupation. Theoccupation applies only to territory where such authority (i.e., themilitary authority of the hostile state) is established and can beexercised (_Art. 42, 2_). In other words, the Hague Regulationsthink of an occupation which is a phase of an as yet undecided war.Until 7 May 1945, the Allies were belligerent occupants in thethen occupied parts of Germany, and their rights and duties werecircumscribed by the respective provisions of the Hague Regulations.As a result of the subjugation of Germany, the legal character of theoccupation of German territory was drastically changed.[560]The view expressed by the two authorities cited appears to havethe support of the International Military Tribunal judgment in thecase against Goering, et al. In that case the defendants contendedthat Germany was not bound by the rules of land warfare in occupiedterritory because Germany had completely subjugated those countries andincorporated them into the German Reich. The Tribunal refers to thedoctrine of subjugation, dependent as it is upon military conquest,and holds that it is unnecessary to decide whether the doctrine hasany application where the subjugation is the result of the crime ofaggressive war. The reason given is significant. The Tribunal said:   The doctrine was never considered to be applicable so long   as there was an army in the field attempting to restore the   occupied countries to their true owners, and in this case,   therefore, the doctrine could not apply to any territories   occupied after 1 September 1939.[561]The clear implication from the foregoing is that the Rules of LandWarfare apply to the conduct of a belligerent in occupied territory solong as there is an army in the field attempting to restore the countryto its true owner, but that those rules do not apply when belligerencyis ended, there is no longer an army in the field, and, as in the caseof Germany, subjugation has occurred by virtue of military conquest.The views which we have expressed are supported by modern scholarsof high standing in the field of international law. While theydiffer somewhat in theory as to the present legal status of Germanyand concerning the situs of residual sovereignty, they appear to bein accord in recognizing that the powers and rights of the AlliedGovernments under existing conditions in Germany are not limited bythe provisions of the Hague Regulations concerning land warfare.

Germanys Present Status, by F. A. Mann, Doctor of Law   (Berlin) (London), paper read on 5 March 1947 before the Grotius   Society in London, published in Sueddeutsche Juristen-Zeitung   (Lawyers Journal of Southern Germany), volume 2, No. 9,   September 1947.   The Influence of the Legal Position of Germany upon the War   Crimes Trial, Dr. Hermann Mosler, Assistant Professor of the   University of Bonn, published in Sueddeutsche Juristen-Zeitung,   volume 2, No. 7, July 1947.   Article published in Neue Justiz (New Justice), by Dr. Alfons   Steininger, Berlin, volume I, No. 7, July 1947, pages 146150.In an article by George A. Zinn, Minister of Justice of Hessen,entitled Germany as the Problem of the Law of States, the authorpoints out that if it be assumed that the present occupation of Germanyconstitutes belligerent occupation in the traditional sense, thenall legal and constitutional changes brought about since 7 May 1945would cease to be valid once the Allied troops were withdrawn and allNazi laws would again and automatically become the law of Germany, aconsummation devoutly to be avoided.Both of the authorities first cited directly assert that the situationat the time of the unconditional surrender resulted in the transfer ofsovereignty to the Allies. In this they are supported by the weightyopinion of Lord Wright, eminent jurist of the British House of Lordsand head of the United Nations War Crimes Commission. For our purposes,however, it is unnecessary to determine the present situs of residualsovereignty. It is sufficient to hold that, by virtue of the situationat the time of unconditional surrender, the Allied Powers wereprovisionally in the exercise of supreme authority, valid and effectiveuntil such time as, by treaty or otherwise, Germany shall be permittedto exercise the full powers of sovereignty. We hold that the legalright of the four Powers to enact C. C. Law 10 is established and thatthe jurisdiction of this Tribunal to try persons charged as major warcriminals of the European Axis must be conceded.We have considered it proper to set forth our views concerning thenature and source of the authority of C. C. Law 10 in its aspect assubstantive legislation. It would have been possible to treat that lawas a binding rule regardless of the righteousness of its provisions,but its justification must ultimately depend upon accepted principlesof justice and morality, and we are not content to treat the statuteas a mere rule of thumb to be blindly applied. We shall shortlydemonstrate that the IMT Charter and C. C. Law 10 provide for thepunishment of crimes against humanity. As set forth in the indictment,the acts charged as crimes against humanity were committed before theoccupation of Germany. They were described as racial persecutions byNazi officials perpetrated upon German nationals. The crime of genocideis an illustration. We think that a tribunal charged with the duty ofenforcing these rules will do well to consider, in determining thedegree of punishment to be imposed, the moral principles which underliethe exercise of power. For that reason we have contrasted the situationwhen Germany was in belligerent occupation of portions of Poland, withthe situation existing under the Four-Power occupation of Germany sincethe surrender. The occupation of Poland by Germany was in every sensebelligerent occupation, precarious in character, while opposing armieswere still in the field. The German occupation of Poland was subjectto the limitations imposed by the Hague Convention and the laws andcustoms of land warfare. In view of these limitations we doubt if anyperson would contend that Germany, during that belligerent occupation,could lawfully have provided tribunals for the punishment of Polishofficials who, before the occupation by Germany, had persecuted theirown people, to wit: Polish nationals. Now the Four Powers are providingby C. C. Law 10 for the punishment of German officials who, before theoccupation of Germany, passed and enforced laws for the persecutionof German nationals upon racial grounds. It appears that it would beequally difficult to justify such action of the Four Powers if thesituation here were the same as the situation which existed in Polandunder German occupation and if consequently the limitations of theHague Convention were applicable. For this reason it seems appropriateto point out the distinction between the two situations. As we haveattempted to show, the moral and legal justification under principlesof international law which authorizes the broader scope of authorityunder C. C. Law 10 is based on the fact that the Four Powers are notnow in belligerent occupation or subject to the limitations set forthin the rules of land warfare. Rather, they have justly and legallyassumed the broader task in Germany which they have solemnly definedand declared, to wit: the task of reorganizing the German Governmentand economy and of punishing persons who, prior to the occupation,were guilty of crimes against humanity committed against their ownnationals. We have pointed out that this difference in the nature ofthe occupation is due to the unconditional surrender of Germany andthe ensuing chaos which required the Four Powers to assume provisionalsupreme authority throughout the German Reich. We are not attempting topass judicially upon a question which is solely within the jurisdictionof the political departments of the Four Powers. The fixing of the dateof the formal end of the war and similar matters will, of course, bedependent upon the action of the political departments. We do not usurptheir function. We merely inquire, in the course of litigation whenthe lives of men are dependent upon decisions which must be both legaland just, whether the great objectives announced by the Four Powersare themselves in harmony with the principles of international law andmorality.In declaring that the expressed determination of the victors to punishGerman officials who slaughtered their own nationals is in harmonywith international principles of justice, we usurp no power; we onlytake judicial notice of the declarations already made by the chiefexecutives of the United States and her former Allies. The fact that C.C. Law 10 on its face is limited to the punishment of German criminalsdoes not transform this Tribunal into a German court. The fact that thefour powers are exercising supreme legislative authority in governingGermany and for the punishment of German criminals does not mean thatthe jurisdiction of this Tribunal rests in the slightest degree uponany German law, prerogative, or sovereignty. We sit as a Tribunaldrawing its sole power and jurisdiction from the will and command ofthe Four occupying Powers.Examination will disclose that C. C. Law 10 possesses a dual aspect.In its first aspect and on its face it purports to be a statutedefining crimes and providing for the punishment of persons who violateits provisions. It is the legislative product of the only body inexistence having and exercising general lawmaking power throughout theReich. The first International Military Tribunal in the case againstGoering, et al., recognized similar provisions of the IMT Charter asbinding legislative enactments. We quote:   The making of the Charter was the exercise of the sovereign   legislative power by the countries to which the German Reich   unconditionally surrendered; and the undoubted right of these   countries to legislate for the occupied territories has been   recognized by the civilized world.[562]   These provisions are binding upon the Tribunal _as the law to   be applied to the case_.[563] [Emphasis added.]Since the IMT Charter and C. C. Law 10 are the products of legislativeaction by an international authority, it follows of necessity thatthere is no national constitution of any one state which could beinvoked to invalidate the substantive provisions of such internationallegislation. It can scarcely be argued that a court which owes itsexistence and jurisdiction solely to the provisions of a given statutecould assume to exercise that jurisdiction and then, in the exercisethereof, declare invalid the act to which it owes its existence.Except as an aid to construction, we cannot and need not go behind thestatute. This was discussed authoritatively by the first InternationalMilitary Tribunal in connection with the contention of defendants thatthe IMT Charter was invalid because it partook of the nature of _expost facto_ legislation. That Tribunal said: The Charter makes theplanning or waging of a war of aggression or a war in violation ofinternational treaties a crime; and _it is, therefore, not strictlynecessary to consider whether and to what extent aggressive war was acrime before the execution of the London Agreement_.[564] [Emphasisadded.]As recently said by an American authority--   The Charter was, of course, binding upon the Tribunal in the   same way that a constitutional statute would bind a domestic   court.[565]In its aspect as a statute defining crime and providing punishmentthe limited purpose of C. C. Law 10 is clearly set forth. It is anexercise of supreme legislative power in and for Germany. It does notpurport to establish by legislative act any new crimes of internationalapplicability. The London Agreement refers to the trial of thoseGerman officers and men and members of the Nazi Party who have beenresponsible for * * * atrocities. C. C. Law 10 recites that it wasenacted to establish a uniform legal basis _in Germany_ for theprosecution of war criminals. [Emphasis added.]Military Government Ordinance No. 7 was enacted pursuant to the powersof the Military Government for the United States Zone of Occupation_within Germany_. [Emphasis added.]We concur in the view expressed by the first International MilitaryTribunal as quoted above, but we observe that the decision wassupported on two grounds. The Tribunal in that case did not stop withthe declaration that it was bound by the IMT Charter as an exercise ofsovereign legislative power. The opinion went on to show that the IMTCharter was also the expression of international law existing at thetime of its creation. All of the war crimes and many, if not all, ofthe crimes against humanity as charged in the indictment in the caseat bar were, as we shall show, violative of preexisting principles ofinternational law. To the extent to which this is true, C. C. Law 10may be deemed to be a codification rather than original substantivelegislation. Insofar as C. C. Law 10 may be thought to go beyondestablished principles of international law, its authority, of course,rests upon the exercise of the sovereign legislative power of thecountries to which the German Reich unconditionally surrendered.We have discussed C. C. Law 10 in its first aspect as substantivelegislation. We now consider its other aspect. Entirely aside fromits character as substantive legislation, C. C. Law 10, together withOrdinance No. 7, provides procedural means previously lacking forthe enforcement within Germany of certain rules of international lawwhich exist throughout the civilized world independently of any newsubstantive legislation. (_Ex parte Quirin_, 317 U.S. 1; 87 L. ed.3; 63 S. Ct. 2.) International law is not the product of statute. Itscontent is not static. The absence from the world of any governmentalbody authorized to enact substantive rules of international law has notprevented the progressive development of that law. After the manner ofthe English common law it has grown to meet the exigencies of changingconditions.It must be conceded that the circumstance which gives to principles ofinternational conduct the dignity and authority of law is their generalacceptance as such by civilized nations, which acceptance is manifestedby international treaties, conventions, authoritative textbooks,practice, and judicial decisions.[566]It does not, however, follow from the foregoing statements that generalacceptance of a rule of international conduct must be manifested byexpress adoption thereof by all civilized states.   The basis of the law, that is to say, what has given to some   principles of general applicability the quality or character of   law has been the acquiescence of the several independent states   which were to be governed thereby.[567][Page 5]   The requisite acquiescence on the part of individual states   has not been reflected in formal or specific approval of every   restriction which the acknowledged requirements of international   justice have appeared, under the circumstances of the particular   case, to dictate or imply. It has been rather a yielding to   principle, and by implication, to logical applications thereof   which have begotten deep-rooted and approved practices.[Page 9]   It should be observed, however, that acquiescence in a proposal   may be inferred from the failure of interested states to make   appropriate objection to practical applications of it. Thus   it is that changes in the law may be wrought gradually and   imperceptibly, like those which by process of accretion alter   the course of a river and change an old boundary. Without   conventional arrangement, and by practices manifesting a common   and sharp deviation from rules once accepted as the law, the   community of states may in fact modify that which governs its   members.[Page 11]   States may through the medium of an international organization   such as the League of Nations, itself the product of agreement,   find it expedient to create and accept fresh restraints that   ultimately win widest approval and acceptance as a part of   the law of nations. The acts of the organization may thus in   fact become sources of international law, at least in case the   members thereof have by their general agreement clothed it with   power to create and put into force fresh rules of restraint.       *       *       *       *       *   But international law is progressive. The period of growth   generally coincides with the period of world upheavals. The   pressure of necessity stimulates the impact of natural law and   of moral ideas and converts them into rules of law deliberately   and overtly recognized by the consensus of civilized mankind.   The experience of two great world wars within a quarter of   a century cannot fail to have deep repercussions on the   senses of the peoples and their demand for an international   law which reflects international justice. I am convinced that   international law has progressed, as it is bound to progress   if it is to be a living and operative force in these days of   widening sense of humanity.[568]For the reasons stated by Lord Wright, this growth by accretion hasbeen greatly accelerated since the First World War.[569] The IMTCharter, the IMT judgment, and C. C. Law 10 are merely great newcases in the book of international law. They constitute authoritativerecognition of principles of individual penal responsibility ininternational affairs which, as we shall show, had been developing formany years. Surely C. C. Law 10, which was enacted by the authorizedrepresentatives of the four greatest Powers on earth, is entitledto judicial respect when it states, Each of the following acts is_recognized_ as a crime. [Emphasis added.] Surely the requisiteinternational approval and acquiescence is established when 23 states,including all of the great powers, have approved the London Agreementand the IMT Charter without dissent from any state. Surely the IMTCharter must be deemed declaratory of the principles of internationallaw in view of its recognition as such by the General Assembly of theUnited Nations. We quote:   The General Assembly recognizes the obligation laid upon it   by article 13, paragraph 1 (a) of the Charter, to initiate   studies and make recommendations for the purpose of encouraging   the progressive development of international law and its   codification;   Takes note of the agreement for the establishment of an   International Military Tribunal for the prosecution and   punishment of the major war criminals of the European Axis,   signed in London on 8 August 1945, and of the Charter annexed   thereto and of the fact that similar principles have been   adopted in the Charter of the International Military Tribunal   for the trial of the major war criminals in the Far East,   proclaimed at Tokyo on 19 January 1946;Therefore--   Affirms the principles of international law recognized by   the Charter of the Nuernberg Tribunal and the judgment of the   Tribunal;   Directs the Committee on Codification of International Law   established by the resolution of the General Assembly of   * * December 1946, to treat as a matter of primary importance   plans for the formulation, in the text of a general codification   of offenses against the peace and security of mankind, or of an   International Criminal Code, of the principles recognized in the   Charter of the Nuernberg Tribunal and in the judgment of the   Tribunal.[570]Before the International Military Tribunal had convened for the trialof Goering, et al., the opinion had been expressed that through theprocess of accretion the provisions of the IMT Charter and consequentlyof C. C. Law 10 had already, in large measure, become incorporated intothe body of international law. We quote:   I understand the Agreement to import that the three classes   of persons which it specifies are war criminals, that the acts   mentioned in classes (_a_), (_b_), and (_c_) are   crimes for which there is properly individual responsibility;   that they are not crimes because of the Agreement of the four   Governments, but that the Governments have scheduled them as   coming under the jurisdiction of the Tribunal because they are   already crimes by existing law. On any other assumption the   Court would not be a court of law but a manifestation of power.   The principles which are declared in the Agreement are not laid   down as an arbitrary direction to the Court but are intended   to define and do, in my opinion, accurately define what is the   existing international law on these matters.[571]A similar view was expressed in the judgment of the InternationalMilitary Tribunal. We quote:   The Charter is not an arbitrary exercise of power on the part   of the victorious nations, but in the view of the Tribunal,   as will be shown, it is the expression of international law   existing at the time of its creation; and to that extent is   itself a contribution to international law.[572]We are empowered to determine the guilt or innocence of persons accusedof acts described as war crimes and crimes against humanityunder rules of international law. At this point, in connection withcherished doctrines of national sovereignty, it is important todistinguish between the rules of common international law which are ofuniversal and superior authority on the one hand, and the provisionsfor enforcement of those rules which are by no means universal on theother. As to the superior authority of international law, we quote:   If there exists a body of international law, which states,   from a sense of legal obligation do in fact observe in   their relations with each other, and which they are unable   individually to alter or destroy, that law must necessarily be   regarded as the law of each political entity deemed to be a   state, and as prevailing throughout places under its control.   This is true although there be no local affirmative action   indicating the adoption by the individual state of international   law.   International law, as the local law of each state, is   necessarily superior to any administrative regulation or statute   or public act at variance with it. There can be no conflict on   an equal plane.[573]This universality and superiority of international law does notnecessarily imply universality of its enforcement. As to the punishmentof persons guilty of violating the laws and customs of war (war crimesin the narrow sense), it has always been recognized that tribunals maybe established and punishment imposed by the state into whose hands theperpetrators fall. These rules of international law were recognizedas paramount, and jurisdiction to enforce them by the injuredbelligerent government, whether within the territorial boundaries ofthe state or in occupied territory, has been unquestioned. (_Ex parteQuirin, supra_; In re: Yamashita, 327 U.S. 1, 90 L. ed.) However,enforcement of international law has been traditionally subject topractical limitations. Within the territorial boundaries of a statehaving a recognized, functioning government presently in the exerciseof sovereign power throughout its territory, a violator of the rulesof international law could be punished only by the authority of theofficials of that state. The law is universal, but such a statereserves unto itself the exclusive power within its boundaries to applyor withhold sanctions. Thus, notwithstanding the paramount authorityof the substantive rules of common international law, the doctrinesof national sovereignty have been preserved through the control ofenforcement machinery. It must be admitted that Germans were not theonly ones who were guilty of committing war crimes; other violators ofinternational law could, no doubt, be tried and punished by the stateof which they were nationals, by the offended state if it can securejurisdiction of the person, or by an international tribunal if ofcompetent authorized jurisdiction.Applying these principles, it appears that the power to punishviolators of international law in Germany is not solely dependent onthe enactment of rules of substantive penal law applicable only inGermany. Nor is the apparent immunity from prosecution of criminals inother states based on the absence there of the rules of internationallaw which we enforce here. Only by giving consideration to theextraordinary and temporary situation in Germany can the procedure herebe harmonized with established principles of national sovereignty. InGermany an international body (the Control Council) has assumed andexercised the power to establish judicial machinery for the punishmentof those who have violated the rules of the common international law, apower which no international authority without consent could assume orexercise within a state having a national government presently in theexercise of its sovereign powers.          _Construction of C. C. Law 10 War Crimes and Crimes                           Against Humanity_We next approach the problem of the construction of C. C. Law 10, forwhatever the scope of international common law may be, the power toenforce it in this case is defined and limited by the terms of thejurisdictional act.The first penal provision of C. C. Law No. 10, with which we areconcerned is as follows:                              Article II       1.--Each of the following acts is recognized as a crime:          *       *       *       *       *       *       *   (_b_) _War Crimes._ Atrocities or offences against   persons or property constituting violations of the laws or   customs of war, including but not limited to, murder, ill   treatment or deportation to slave labour or for any other   purpose, of civilian population from occupied territory, murder   or ill treatment of prisoners of war or persons on the seas,   killing of hostages, plunder of public or private property,   wanton destruction of cities, towns or villages, or devastation   not justified by military necessity.Here we observe the controlling effect of common international lawas such, for the statutes by which we are governed have adopted andincorporated the rules of international law as the rules by which warcrimes are to be identified. This legislative practice by which thelaws or customs of war are incorporated by reference into a statuteis not unknown in the United States. (See cases cited in _Ex parteQuirin, supra_.)The scope of inquiry as to war crimes is, of course, limited by theprovisions, properly construed, of the IMT Charter and C. C. Law 10.In this particular, the two enactments are in substantial harmony.Both indicate by inclusion and exclusion the intent that the term warcrimes shall be employed to cover acts in violation of the laws andcustoms of war directed against non-Germans, and shall not includeatrocities committed by Germans against their own nationals. It willbe observed that article 6 of the IMT Charter enumerates as war crimesacts against prisoners of war, persons on the seas, hostages, wantondestruction of cities and the like, devastation not justified bymilitary necessity, plunder of public or private property (obviouslynot property of Germany or Germans), and ill-treatment or deportationto slave labor or for any other purpose of civilian population _ofor in_ occupied territory. [Emphasis added.] C. C. Law 10,_supra_, employs similar language. It reads--    * * * ill treatment or deportation to slave labour or for   any other purpose, _of civilian population from occupied   territory_. [Emphasis added.]This legislative intent becomes more manifest when we consider theprovisions of the IMT Charter and of C. C. Law 10 which deal withcrimes against humanity. Article 6 of the IMT Charter defines crimesagainst humanity, as follows:    * * * murder, extermination, enslavement, deportation, and   other inhumane acts committed against any civilian population,   before or during the war; or persecutions on political, racial   or religious grounds in execution of or in connection with any   crime within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, whether or not in   violation of the domestic law of the country where perpetrated.C. C. Law 10 defines as criminal:    * * * Atrocities and offences, including but not limited to   murder, extermination, enslavement, deportation, imprisonment,   torture, rape, or other inhumane acts committed against any   civilian population, or persecutions on political, racial or   religious grounds whether or not in violation of the domestic   laws of the country where perpetrated.Obviously, these sections are not surplusage. They supplement thepreceding sections on war crimes and include within their prohibitionnot only war crimes, but also acts not included within the precedingdefinitions of war crimes. In place of atrocities committed againstcivilians of or in or from occupied territory, these sections prohibitatrocities against any civilian population. Again, persecutions onracial, religious, or political grounds are within our jurisdictionwhether or not in violation of the domestic laws of the countrywhere perpetrated. We have already demonstrated that C. C. Law 10is specifically directed to the punishment of German criminals. Itis therefore clear that the intent of the statute on crimes againsthumanity is to punish for persecutions and the like, whether inaccord with or in violation of the domestic laws of the country whereperpetrated, to wit: Germany. The intent was to provide that compliancewith German law should be no defense. Article III of C. C. Law 10clearly demonstrates that acts by Germans against German nationals mayconstitute crimes against humanity within the jurisdiction of thisTribunal to punish. That article provides that each occupying authoritywithin its zone of occupation shall have the right to cause personssuspected of having committed a crime to be arrested and (_d_)shall have the right to cause all persons so arrested * * * to bebrought to trial * * *. Such Tribunal may, in the case of crimescommitted by persons of German citizenship or nationality against otherpersons of German citizenship or nationality, or stateless persons, bea German court, if authorized by the occupying authorities.As recently asserted by General Telford Taylor before Tribunal IV, inthe case of the United States _vs._ Flick, et al.:[574]   This constitutes an explicit recognition that acts committed   by Germans against other Germans are punishable as crimes under   Law No. 10, according to the definitions contained therein,   since only such crimes may be tried by German courts, in the   discretion of the occupying power. If the occupying power fails   to authorize German courts to try crimes committed by Germans   against other Germans (and in the American Zone of Occupation   no such authorization has been given), then these cases are   tried only before non-German tribunals, such as these military   tribunals.Our jurisdiction to try persons charged with crimes against humanityis limited in scope, both by definition and illustration, as appearsfrom C. C. Law 10. It is not the isolated crime by a private Germanindividual which is condemned, nor is it the isolated crime perpetratedby the German Reich through its officers against a private individual.It is significant that the enactment employs the words against anycivilian population instead of against any civilian individual.The provision is directed against offenses and inhumane acts andpersecutions on political, racial, or religious grounds systematicallyorganized and conducted by or with the approval of government.The opinion of the first International Military Tribunal in the caseagainst Goering, et al., lends support to our conclusion. That opinionrecognized the distinction between war crimes and crimes againsthumanity, and said:   * * * insofar as the inhumane acts charged in the indictment,   and committed after the beginning of the war, did not constitute   war crimes, they were all committed in execution of, or in   connection with, the aggressive war, and therefore constituted   crimes against humanity.[575]The evidence to be later reviewed establishes that certain inhumaneacts charged in count three of the indictment were committed inexecution of, and in connection with, aggressive war and were thereforecrimes against humanity even under the provisions of the IMT Charter,but it must be noted that C. C. Law 10 differs materially from theCharter. The latter defines crimes against humanity as inhumane acts,etc., committed in execution of, or in connection with, any crimewithin the jurisdiction of the tribunal, whereas in C. C. Law 10 thewords last quoted are deliberately omitted from the definition.                     _THE EX POST FACTO PRINCIPLE_The defendants claim protection under the principle _nullum crimensine lege_, though they withheld from others the benefit of thatrule during the Hitler regime. Obviously the principle in questionconstitutes no limitation upon the power or right of the Tribunalto punish acts which can properly be held to have been violationsof international law when committed. By way of illustration, weobserve that C. C. Law 10, article II, paragraph 1(_b_), _WarCrimes_, has by reference incorporated the rules by which warcrimes are to be identified. In all such cases it remains only for theTribunal, after the manner of the common law, to determine the contentof those rules under the impact of changing conditions.Whatever view may be held as to the nature and source of our authorityunder C. C. Law 10 and under common international law, the _ex postfacto_ rule, properly understood, constitutes no legal nor moralbarrier to prosecution in this case.Under written constitutions the _ex post facto_ rule condemnsstatutes which define as criminal, acts committed before the lawwas passed, but the _ex post facto_ rule cannot apply in theinternational field as it does under constitutional mandate in thedomestic field. Even in the domestic field the prohibition of therule does not apply to the decisions of common law courts, though thequestion at issue be novel. International law is not the product ofstatute for the simple reason that there is as yet no world authorityempowered to enact statutes of universal application. Internationallaw is the product of multipartite treaties, conventions, judicialdecisions and customs which have received international acceptanceor acquiescence. It would be sheer absurdity to suggest that the_ex post facto_ rule, as known to constitutional states, couldbe applied to a treaty, a custom, or a common law decision of aninternational tribunal, or to the international acquiescence whichfollows the event. To have attempted to apply the _ex post facto_principle to judicial decisions of common international law wouldhave been to strangle that law at birth. As applied in the fieldof international law, the principle _nullum crimen sine lege_received its true interpretation in the opinion of the IMT in the caseversus Goering, et al. The question arose with reference to crimesagainst the peace, but the opinion expressed is equally applicable towar crimes and crimes against humanity. The Tribunal said:   In the first place, it is to be observed that the maxim   _nullum crimen sine lege_ is not a limitation of   sovereignty, but is in general a principle of justice. To assert   that it is unjust to punish those who in defiance of treaties   and assurances have attacked neighboring states without warning   is obviously untrue, for in such circumstances the attacker must   know that he is doing wrong, and so far from it being unjust to   punish him, it would be unjust if his wrong were allowed to go   unpunished.[576]To the same effect we quote the distinguished statesman andinternational authority, Henry L. Stimson--   A mistaken appeal to this principle has been the cause of much   confusion about the Nuremberg trial. It is argued that parts   of the Tribunals Charter, written in 1945, make crimes out   of what before were activities beyond the scope of national   and international law. Were this an exact statement of the   situation we might well be concerned, but it is not. It rests   on a misconception of the whole nature of the law of nations.   International law is not a body of authoritative codes or   statutes; it is the gradual expression, case by case, of the   moral judgments of the civilized world. As such, it corresponds   precisely to the common law of Anglo-American tradition. We can   understand the law of Nuremberg only if we see it for what it   is--a great new case in the book of international law, and not a   formal enforcement of codified statutes. A look at the charges   will show what I mean.       *       *       *       *       *   It was the Nazi confidence that we would never chase and catch   them, and not a misunderstanding of our opinion of them, that   led them to commit their crimes. Our offense was thus that of   the man who passed by on the other side. That we have finally   recognized our negligence and named the criminals for what they   are is a piece of righteousness too long delayed by fear.[577]That the conception of retrospective legislation which prevails underconstitutional provisions in the United States does not receivecomplete recognition in other enlightened legal systems is illustratedby the decision in Phillips _vs._ Eyre, L.R. 6 Q.B. 1 [27(187071)] described by Lord Wright as a case of great authority. Wequote:   In fine, allowing the general inexpediency of retrospective   legislation, it cannot be pronounced naturally or necessarily   unjust. There may be occasions and circumstances involving the   safety of the state, or even the conduct of individual subjects,   the justice of which, prospective laws made for ordinary   occasions and the usual exigencies of society for want of   prevision fail to meet, and in which * * * the inconvenience and   wrong, _summum jus summa injuria_.We quote with approval the words of Sir David Maxwell-Fyfe:   With regard to crimes against humanity, this at any rate is   clear. The Nazis, when they persecuted and murdered countless   Jews and political opponents in Germany, knew that what they   were doing was wrong and that their actions were crimes which   had been condemned by the criminal law of every civilized state.   When these crimes were mixed with the preparation for aggressive   war and later with the commission of war crimes in occupied   territories, it cannot be a matter of complaint that a procedure   is established for their punishment.[578]Concerning the mooted _ex post facto_ issue, Professor Wechsler ofColumbia University writes:   These are, indeed, the issues that are currently mooted. But   there are elements in the debate that should lead us to be   suspicious of the issues as they are drawn in these terms. For,   most of those who mount the attack on one or another of these   contentions hasten to assure us that their plea is not one of   immunity for the defendants; they argue only that they should   have been disposed of politically, that is, dispatched out of   hand. This is a curious position indeed. A punitive enterprise   launched on the basis of general rules, administered in an   adversary proceeding under a separation of prosecutive and   adjudicative powers is, in the name of law and justice, asserted   to be less desirable than an _ex parte_ execution list or a   drumhead court martial constituted in the immediate aftermath of   the war. I state my view reservedly when I say that history will   accept no conception of law, politics or justice that supports a   submission in these terms.Again, he says:   There is, indeed, too large a disposition among the defenders   of Nuremberg to look for stray tags of international   pronouncements and reason therefrom that the law of Nuremberg   was previously fully laid down. If the Kellogg-Briand Pact or   a general conception of international obligation sufficed to   authorize England, and would have authorized us, to declare war   on Germany in defense of Poland--and in this enterprise to kill   countless thousands of German soldiers and civilians--can it be   possible that it failed to authorize punitive action against   individual Germans judicially determined to be responsible   for the Polish attack? To be sure, we would demand a more   explicit authorization for punishment in domestic law, for we   have adopted for the protection of individuals a prophylactic   principle absolutely forbidding retroactivity that we can afford   to carry to that extreme. International society, being less   stable, can afford less luxury. We admit that in other respects.   Why should we deny it here?[579]Many of the laws of the Weimar era which were enacted for theprotection of human rights have never been repealed. Many actsconstituting war crimes or crimes against humanity as defined in C.C. Law 10 were committed or permitted in direct violation also of theprovisions of the German criminal law. It is true that this Tribunalcan try no defendant merely because of a violation of the German penalcode, but it is equally true that the rule against retrospectivelegislation, as a rule of justice and fair play, should be no defenseif the act which he committed in violation of C. C. Law 10 was alsoknown to him to be a punishable crime under his own domestic law.As a principle of justice and fair play, the rule in question willbe given full effect. As applied in the field of international lawthat principle requires proof before conviction that the accused knewor should have known that in matters of international concern he wasguilty of participation in a nationally organized system of injusticeand persecution shocking to the moral sense of mankind, and that heknew or should have known that he would be subject to punishmentif caught. Whether it be considered codification or substantivelegislation, no person who knowingly committed the acts made punishableby C. C. Law 10 can assert that he did not know that he would bebrought to account for his acts. Notice of intent to punish wasrepeatedly given by the only means available in international affairs,namely, the solemn warning of the governments of the states at warwith Germany. Not only were the defendants warned of swift retributionby the express declaration of the Allies at Moscow of 30 October1943. Long prior to the Second World War the principle of personalresponsibility had been recognized.   The Council of the Conference of Paris of 1919 undertook, with   the aid of the Commission on the Responsibility of the Authors   of the War and on Enforcement of Penalties, to incorporate   in the treaty of peace arrangements for the punishment   of individuals charged with responsibility for certain   offenses.[580]That Commission on Responsibility of Authors of the War found that--   The war was carried on by the central empires, together with   their allies, Turkey and Bulgaria, by barbarous or illegitimate   methods in violation of the established laws and customs of war   and the elementary laws of humanity.[581]As its conclusion, the Commission solemnly declared:   All persons belonging to enemy countries, however high their   position may have been, without distinction of rank, including   Chiefs of States, who have been guilty of offences against the   laws and customs of war or the laws of humanity, are liable to   criminal prosecution.[582]The American members of that Commission, though in substantial accordwith the finding, nevertheless expressed a reservation as to the lawsof humanity. The express wording of the London Charter and of C. C.Law 10 constitutes clear evidence of the fact that the position of theAmerican Government is now in harmony with the Declaration of the ParisCommission concerning the laws of humanity. We quote further from thereport of the Paris Commission:   Every belligerent has, according to international law, the   power and authority to try the individuals alleged to be guilty   of the crimes of which an enumeration has been given in chapter   II on Violations of the Laws and Customs of War, if such persons   have been taken prisoners or have otherwise fallen into its   power. Each belligerent has, or has power to set up, pursuant to   its own legislation, an appropriate tribunal, military or civil,   for the trial of cases.[583]According to the Treaty of Versailles, article 228, the GermanGovernment itself recognized the right to the Allied and associatedpowers to bring before military tribunals persons accused of offensesagainst the laws and customs of war. Such persons who might be foundguilty were to be sentenced to punishments laid down by law.[584]Some Germans were, in fact, tried for the commission of such crimes.The foregoing considerations demonstrate that the principle _nullumcrimen sine lege_, when properly understood and applied, constitutesno legal or moral barrier to prosecution in the case at bar.                 CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY AS VIOLATIVE                         OF INTERNATIONAL LAWC. C. Law 10 is not limited to the punishment of persons guilty ofviolating the laws and customs of war in the narrow sense; furthermore,it can no longer be said that violations of the laws and customs ofwar are the only offenses recognized by common international law. Theforce of circumstance, the grim fact of world-wide interdependence, andthe moral pressure of public opinion have resulted in internationalrecognition that certain crimes against humanity committed by Naziauthority against German nationals constituted violations not alone ofstatute but also of common international law. We quote:   If a state is unhampered in its activities that affect the   interests of any other, it is due to the circumstance that the   practice of nations has not established that the welfare of the   international society is adversely affected thereby. Hence that   society has not been incited or aroused to endeavor to impose   restraints; and by its law none are imposed. The Covenant of the   League of Nations takes exact cognizance of the situation in   its reference to disputes which arise out of a matter which by   international law is solely within the domestic jurisdiction   of a party thereto. It is that law which as a product of the   acquiescence of states permits the particular activity of the   individual state to be deemed a domestic one.   In as much as changing estimates are to be anticipated, and   as the evolution of thought in this regard appears to be   constant and is perhaps now more obvious than at any time since   the United States came into being, the circumstance that at   any given period the solution of a particular question is by   international law deemed to be solely within the control or   jurisdiction of one state, gives frail assurance that it will   always be so regarded.[585]   The family of nations is not unconcerned with the life and   experience of the private individual in his relationships with   the state of which he is a national. Evidence of concern has   become increasingly abundant since World War I, and is reflected   in treaties through which that conflict was brought to a close,   particularly in provisions designed to safeguard the racial,   linguistic and religious minorities inhabiting the territories   of certain states, and in the terms of part XIII of the Treaty   of Versailles, of June 28, 1919, in respect to labour, as well   as in article XXIII of that treaty embraced in the Covenant of   the League of Nations.[586]   The nature and extent of the latitude accorded a state in the   treatment of its own nationals has been observed elsewhere. It   has been seen that certain forms or degrees of harsh treatment   of such individuals may be deemed to attain an international   significance because of their direct and adverse effect upon   the rights and interests of the outside world. For that reason   it would be unscientific to declare at this day that tyrannical   conduct, or massacres, or religious persecutions are wholly   unrelated to the foreign relations of the territorial sovereign   which is guilty of them. If it can be shown that such acts   are immediately and necessarily injurious to the nationals of   a particular foreign state, grounds for interference by it   may be acknowledged. Again, the society of nations, acting   collectively, may not unreasonably maintain that a state   yielding to such excesses renders itself unfit to perform its   international obligations, especially in so far as they pertain   to the protection of foreign life and property within its   domain.[587] The property of interference obviously demands in   every case a convincing showing that there is in fact a causal   connection between the harsh treatment complained of, and the   outside state that essays to thwart it.The international concern over the commission of crimes againsthumanity has been greatly intensified in recent years. The fact ofsuch concern is not a recent phenomenon, however. England, France, andRussia intervened to end the atrocities in the Greco-Turkish warfare in1827.[588]President Van Buren, through his Secretary of State, intervened withthe Sultan of Turkey in 1840 in behalf of the persecuted Jews ofDamascus and Rhodes.[589]The French intervened and by force undertook to check religiousatrocities in Lebanon, in 1861.[590]Various nations directed protests to the governments of Russia andRumania with respect to pogroms and atrocities against Jews. Similarprotests were made to the government of Turkey on behalf of thepersecuted Christian minorities. In 1872 the United States, Germany,and five other powers protested to Rumania; and in 1915, the GermanGovernment joined in a remonstrance to Turkey on account of similarpersecutions.[591]In 1902 the American Secretary of State, John Hay, addressed to Rumaniaa remonstrance in the name of humanity against Jewish persecutions,saying, This government cannot be a tacit party to such internationalwrongs.Again, in connection with the Kishenef [Kishinev] and other massacresin Russia in 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt stated:   * * * Nevertheless there are occasional crimes committed on so   vast a scale and of such peculiar horror as to make us doubt   whether it is not our manifest duty to endeavor at least to show   our disapproval of the deed and our sympathy with those who have   suffered by it. The cases must be extreme in which such a course   is justifiable. * * * The cases in which we could interfere by   force of arms as we interfered to put a stop to intolerable   conditions in Cuba are necessarily very few. * * *[592]Concerning the American intervention in Cuba in 1898, PresidentMcKinley stated:   First. In the cause of humanity and to put an end to the   barbarities, bloodshed, starvation, and horrible miseries now   existing there, and which the parties to the conflict are either   unable or unwilling to stop or mitigate. It is no answer to say   this is all in another country, belonging to another nation,   and therefore none of our business. It is specially our duty,   for it is right at our door.[593]The same principle was recognized as early as 1878 by a learned Germanprofessor of law, who wrote:   States are allowed to interfere in the name of international   law if humanity rights are violated to the detriment of any   single race.[594]Finally, we quote the words of Sir Hartley Shawcross, the British ChiefProsecutor at the trial of Goering, et al.:   The rights of humanitarian intervention on behalf of the   rights of man trampled upon by a state in a manner shocking   the sense of mankind has long been considered to form part of   the [recognized] law of nations. Here, too, the Charter merely   develops a preexisting principle.[595]We hold that crimes against humanity as defined in C. C. Law 10must be strictly construed to exclude isolated cases of atrocity orpersecution whether committed by private individuals or by governmentalauthority. As we construe it, that section provides for punishment ofcrimes committed against German nationals only where there is proofof conscious participation in systematic government organized orapproved procedures amounting to atrocities and offenses of the kindspecified in the act and committed against populations or amounting topersecutions on political, racial, or religious grounds.Thus, the statute is limited by construction to the type of criminalactivity which prior to 1939 was and still is a matter of internationalconcern. Whether or not such atrocities constitute technical violationsof laws and customs of war, they were acts of such scope andmalevolence, and they so clearly imperiled the peace of the world thatthey must be deemed to have become violations of international law.This principle was recognized although it was misapplied by the ThirdReich. Hitler expressly justified his early acts of aggression againstCzechoslovakia on the ground that the alleged persecution of racialGermans by the government of that country was a matter of internationalconcern warranting intervention by Germany. Organized Czechoslovakianpersecution of racial Germans in Sudetenland was a fiction supportedby framed incidents, but the principle invoked by Hitler was the onewhich we have recognized, namely, that government organized racialpersecutions are violations of international law.As the prime illustration of a crime against humanity under C. C.Law 10, which by reason of its magnitude and its internationalrepercussions has been recognized as a violation of commoninternational law, we cite genocide which will shortly receive ourfull consideration. A resolution recently adopted by the GeneralAssembly of the United Nations is in part as follows:   Genocide is a denial of the right of existence of entire   human groups, as homicide is a denial of the right to live of   individual human beings; such denial of the right of existence   shocks the conscience of mankind, results in great losses   to humanity in the form of cultural and other contributions   represented by these human groups, and is contrary to moral law   and to the spirit and aims of the United Nations.   Many instances of such crimes of genocide have occurred when   racial, religious, political, and other groups have been   destroyed, entirely or in part.   The punishment of the crime of genocide is a matter of   international concern.   The General Assembly therefore--   Affirms that genocide is a crime under international law which   the civilized world condemns, and for the commission of which   principals and accomplices--whether private individuals, public   officials, or statesmen, and whether the crime is committed   on religious, racial, political or any other grounds--are   punishable; * * *.[596]The General Assembly is not an international legislature, but it isthe most authoritative organ in existence for the interpretation ofworld opinion. Its recognition of genocide as an international crime ispersuasive evidence of the fact. We approve and adopt its conclusions.Whether the crime against humanity is the product of statute or ofcommon international law, or, as we believe, of both, we find noinjustice to persons tried for such crimes. They are chargeable withknowledge that such acts were wrong and were punishable when committed.The defendants contend that they should not be found guilty becausethey acted within the authority and by the command of German laws anddecrees. Concerning crimes against humanity, C. C. Law 10 provides forpunishment whether or not the acts were in violation of the domesticlaws of the country where perpetrated (C. C. Law 10, art. II, par.1(_c_)). That enactment also provides the fact that any personacted pursuant to the order of his Government or of a superior does notfree him from responsibility for a crime, but may be considered inmitigation. (C. C. Law 10, art. II, par. 4(_b_).)The foregoing provisions constitute a sufficient, but not theentire, answer to the contention of the defendants. The argumentthat compliance with German law is a defense to the charge restson a misconception of the basic theory which supports our entireproceedings. The Nuernberg Tribunals are not German courts. They arenot enforcing German law. The charges are not based on violationby the defendants of German law. On the contrary, the jurisdictionof this Tribunal rests on international authority. It enforces thelaw as declared by the IMT Charter and C. C. Law 10, and within thelimitations on the power conferred, it enforces international law assuperior in authority to any German statute or decree. It is true,as defendants contend, that German courts under the Third Reichwere required to follow German law (i.e., the expressed will ofHitler) even when it was contrary to international law. But no suchlimitation can be applied to this Tribunal. Here we have the paramountsubstantive law, plus a Tribunal authorized and required to apply itnotwithstanding the inconsistent provisions of German local law. Thevery essence of the prosecution case is that the laws, the Hitleriandecrees and the Draconic, corrupt, and perverted Nazi judicial systemthemselves constituted the substance of war crimes and crimes againsthumanity and that participation in the enactment and enforcementof them amounts to complicity in crime. We have pointed out thatgovernmental participation is a material element of the crime againsthumanity. Only when official organs of sovereignty participated inatrocities and persecutions did those crimes assume internationalproportions. It can scarcely be said that governmental participation,the proof of which is necessary for conviction, can also be a defenseto the charge.Frank recognition of the following facts is essential. Thejurisdictional enactments of the Control Council, the form of theindictment, and the judicial procedure prescribed for this Tribunalare not governed by the familiar rules of American criminal law andprocedure. This Tribunal, although composed of American judges schooledin the system and rules of the common law, is sitting by virtue ofinternational authority and can carry with it only the broad principlesof justice and fair play which underlie all civilized concepts of lawand procedure.No defendant is specifically charged in the indictment with themurder or abuse of any particular person. If he were, the indictmentwould, no doubt, name the alleged victim. Simple murder and isolatedinstances of atrocities do not constitute the gravamen of the charge.Defendants are charged with crimes of such immensity that merespecific instances of criminality appear insignificant by comparison.The charge, in brief, is that of conscious participation in a nationwide government-organized system of cruelty and injustice, in violationof the laws of war and of humanity, and perpetrated in the name oflaw by the authority of the Ministry of Justice, and through theinstrumentality of the courts. The dagger of the assassin was concealedbeneath the robe of the jurist. The record is replete with evidenceof specific criminal acts, but they are not the crimes charged in theindictment. They constitute evidence of the intentional participationof the defendants and serve as illustrations of the nature and effectof the greater crimes charged in the indictment. Thus it is that theapparent generality of the indictment was not only necessary butproper. No indictment couched in specific terms and in the manner ofthe common law could have encompassed within practicable limits thegenerality of the offense with which these defendants stand charged.The prosecution has introduced evidence concerning acts which occurredbefore the outbreak of the war in 1939. Some such acts are relevantupon the charges contained in counts two, three, and four, but asstated by the prosecution, None of these acts is charged as anindependent offense in this particular indictment. We direct ourconsideration to the issue of guilt or innocence after the outbreak ofthe war in accordance with the specific limitations of time set forthin counts two, three, and four of the indictment. In measuring theconduct of the individual defendants by the standards of C. C. Law 10,we are also to be guided by article II, paragraph 2 of that law, whichprovides that a person is deemed to have committed a crime as definedin paragraph 1 of this article, if he was (_a_) a principal or(_b_) was an accessory to the commission of any such crime orordered or abetted the same or (_c_) took a consenting parttherein or (_d_) was connected with plans or enterprises involvingits commission or (_e_) was a member of any organization or groupconnected with the commission of any such crime * * *.Before considering the progressive degeneration of the judicial systemunder Nazi rule, it should be observed that at least on paper theGermans had developed, under the Weimar republic, a civilized andenlightened system of jurisprudence. A few illustrations will suffice.The power of judicial appointment and the independence of the judgeswas jealously guarded by the individual states within the Reich. Thefollowing acts were declared criminal under the provisions of theGerman criminal code:   The acceptance of bribes or inducements by a judge, offered for   the purpose of influencing his decision--Section 334.   Action by an official, who, in the conduct or decision of a   case, deliberately makes himself guilty of diverting the law to   the disadvantage of one of the parties--Section 336.   The securing of a confession by duress--Section 343.   The act of an official who, in the exercise of his duty in a   criminal proceeding, knowingly causes any person to escape   penalty provided by law--Section 346.   Action by a superior officer who intentionally induces * * * his   subordinate to commit a punishable act in office, or knowingly   connives at such a punishable offense on the part of his   subordinate--Section 357.In the Weimar constitution it was provided that the generally acceptedrules of international law are to be considered as binding, integralparts of the law of the German Reich. (Art. 4.)The Constitution also guaranteed to all Germans--    Equality before the law (Art. 109);    Citizenship, the right of travel and emigration (Arts. 110, 111, and 112);    Freedom of person (Art. 114);    Freedom of speech, assembly, and association (Arts. 118, 123, and 124);    Right of just compensation for property expropriated (Art. 153);    Right of inheritance (Art. 154);There were, however, in the Weimar constitution the germs of thedisease from which it died. In article 48 of the constitution it wasprovided:   The Reich President may, if the public safety and order of the   German Reich are considerably disturbed or endangered, take such   measures as are necessary to restore public safety and order. If   necessary, he may intervene with the help of the armed forces.   For this purpose he may temporarily suspend, either partially or   wholly, the fundamental rights established in articles 114, 115,   117, 118, 123, 124, and 153.A review of the evidence will disclose that substantially everyprinciple of justice which was enunciated in the above-mentioned lawsand constitutional provisions was after 1933 violated by the Hitlerregime.The first step in the march toward absolutism was of necessity theassumption and consolidation of power. It was deemed essential thatthe government be authorized to make laws by decree, unhampered bythe limitations of the Weimar republic, by the Reichstag, or bythe independent action of the several German States (Laender). Toaccomplish this end on 28 February 1933 a decree was promulgated overthe signature of President von Hindenburg, Chancellor Hitler, ReichMinister of the Interior Frick, and Reich Minister of Justice Guertner.Briefly stated, this decree expressly suspended the provisions of theWeimar constitution guaranteeing personal liberty, free speech, press,assembly, association, privacy of communication, freedom of search, andinviolability of property rights. The decree further provided that theReich government might, to restore public security, temporarily takeover the powers of the highest State authority. It was declared in thepreamble that the decree was passed in virtue of article 48 (2) ofthe Weimar constitution. This is the article to which we previouslyreferred and which authorized the Reichspraesident to suspend the veryprovisions which were in fact stricken down by the Hitler decree of 28February. The decree was reinforced on 24 March 1933 by the act of anintimidated Reichstag. The enactment was subtly drawn to accomplish adouble purpose. It provided that laws decreed by the government maydeviate from the constitution, but the act did not stop there; it alsoprovided that laws of the Reich can be decreed by the government apartfrom the procedure provided by the Constitution. We quote in part--   Article 1.--Laws of the Reich can be decreed, apart from the   procedure provided by the constitution of the Reich, also by the   government of the Reich. This also applies to the laws mentioned   in articles 85, paragraph 2, and 87 of the constitution of the   Reich.   Article 2.--The laws decreed by the government of the Reich may   deviate from the constitution of the Reich as far as they do not   concern the institution of the Reichstag and the Reich council   as such. The rights of the Reichspraesident remain untouched.   Article 3.--Articles 68 through 77 of the constitution of the   Reich do not apply to laws decreed by the government of the   Reich.Though the Enabling Act expressly repealed only a small portion of theconstitution, nevertheless that portion which was repealed cleared theprocedural way for the nullification of the rest if and when decreesshould be promulgated by the government. On 14 July 1933 a law waspassed declaring the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei(NSDAP) to be the only political party and making it a crime tomaintain or form any other political party.[597] Thus, it was madedoubly sure that any legislation thereafter enacted by the Reichstagwould be in harmony with the will of the government.Although the process by which the Hitler regime came into power wastainted with illegality and duress, nevertheless the power thusseized was later consolidated and the regime thereafter did receivethe organized support of the German people and recognition by foreignpowers. On 30 January 1934, more than 10 months after the enactmentof the enabling act, and subsequent to the Reichstag election of12 November 1933, the Reichstag passed an act by unanimous voteproviding that the sovereign powers of the Laender are transferredto the Reich, and further providing that the Reich government mayissue new constitutional laws. The act was regularly signed by ReichPresident von Hindenburg, and by Reich Chancellor Hitler, and MinisterFrick.[598] The provisions of the Enabling Act were renewed by acts ofthe Reichstag on 30 January 1937 and again on 30 January 1939.On 14 June 1942, Dr. Lammers, Reich Minister and Chief of the ReichChancellery, stated that they would stress the fact that the Fuehrerhimself and the Reich cabinet should not be eliminated from the powersof legislation.The conduct of the defendants must be seen in a context of preparationfor aggressive war, and must be interpreted as within the frameworkof the criminal law and judicial system of the Third Reich. We shall,therefore, next consider the legal and judicial process by which theentire judicial system was transformed into a tool for the propagationof the National Socialist ideology, the extermination of oppositionthereto, and the advancement of plans for aggressive war and worldconquest. Though the overt acts with which defendants are chargedoccurred after September 1939, the evidence now to be considered willmake clear the conditions under which the defendants acted and willshow knowledge, intent, and motive on their part, for in the period ofpreparation some of the defendants played a leading part in molding thejudicial system which they later employed.Beginning in 1933, there developed side by side two processes by whichthe Ministry of Justice and the courts were equipped for terroristicfunctions in support of the Nazi regime. By the first, the powerof life and death was ever more broadly vested in the courts. Bythe second, the penal laws were extended in such inconclusive andindefinite terms as to vest in the judges the widest discretion in thechoice of law to be applied, and in the construction of the chosen lawin any given case. In 1933, by the law for the Protection againstViolent Political Acts, the death sentence was authorized, though notrequired, as to a number of crimes whenever milder penalty has beenprescribed hitherto.[599]On 24 April 1934, the definition of high treason was greatly expandedand the death sentence was authorized, though not required, in numerousinstances. The manner in which this law was applied renders itall-important. The following provisions, among others, illustrate thescope of the amended law and the discretionary power of the judge:   83. Whoever publicly incites to or solicits an undertaking of   high treason shall be punished by confinement in a penitentiary   not to exceed 10 years.   Whoever prepares an undertaking of high treason in any other   way shall be punished in like manner.   The death penalty, or confinement in a penitentiary for life,   or for not less than 2 years, shall be inflicted:   (1) if the act was directed toward establishing or maintaining   an organized combination for the preparation of high treason or          *       *       *       *       *       *       *   (3) if the act was directed toward influencing the masses by   making or distributing writings, recordings, or pictures, or by   the installation of wireless telegraph or telephone, or   (4) if the act was committed abroad or was committed in such   a manner that the offender undertook to import writings,   recordings, or pictures from abroad or for the purpose of   distribution within the country.[600]On 20 December 1934, the government promulgated the following enactmentLaw on Treacherous Acts against State and Party and for the Protectionof Party Uniforms, which provided in part as follows:   Chapter 1. Article 1. (1) Unless heavier punishment is   sanctioned under the authority of a law previously established,   imprisonment not to exceed 2 years shall be imposed upon anybody   deliberately making false or grievous statements, fit to injure   the welfare or the prestige of the government of the Reich, the   National Socialist Workers Party, or its agencies. If such   statements are made or circulated in public, imprisonment for   not less than 3 months shall be imposed.   Article 2. (1) Anyone who makes or circulates statements   proving a malicious, baiting or low-minded attitude toward   leading personalities of the State or the NSDAP, or toward   orders issued by them or toward institutions created by   them--fit to undermine the confidence of the people in its   political leadership--shall be punished with imprisonment.   (2) Statements of this kind which are not made in public shall   warrant the same punishment--provided the offender figures on   his statements eventually being circulated in public.A decisive step was taken by the Law to Change the Penal Code, whichwas promulgated on 28 June 1935 by Adolf Hitler as Fuehrer and ReichChancellor, and by Dr. Guertner as Reich Minister of Justice. Article 2of that enactment is as follows:   Article 2. Whoever commits an act which the law declares   as punishable or which deserves punishment according to the   fundamental idea of a penal law and the sound concept of   the people, shall be punished. If no specific penal law can   be directly applied to this act, then it shall be punished   according to the law whose underlying principle can be most   readily applied to the act.In substance, this edict constituted a complete repudiation of the rulethat criminal statutes should be definite and certain and vested in thejudge a wide discretion in which Party political ideology and influencewere substituted for the control of law as the guide to judicialdecision.Section 90 (f) of the Penal Code, as enacted on 24 April 1934, provided:   Whoever publicly, or as a German staying abroad, causes serious   danger to the reputation of the German nation by an untrue or   grossly inaccurate statement of a factual nature, shall be   punished by confinement in a penitentiary.The act was amended on 20 September 1944 as follows:   In especially serious cases a German may be punished by   death.[601]By the act of 28 June 1935 it was provided:   Whoever publicly profanes the German National Socialist Labor   Party, its subdivisions, symbols, standards, and banners, its   insignia or decorations, or maliciously and with premeditation   exposes them to contempt shall be punished by imprisonment.   The offense shall be prosecuted only upon order of the Reich   Minister of Justice who shall issue such order in agreement with   the Fuehrers deputy.[602]By the law of 28 June 1935 it was provided:   If the main proceedings show that the defendant committed an   act which deserves punishment according to the common sense of   the people but which is not declared punishable by the law, then   the court must investigate whether the underlying principle of a   penal law applies to this act and whether justice can be helped   to triumph by the proper application of this penal law. (Article   2 of the Penal Code.)[603]A decree of 1 December 1936 provides in part as follows:   Section 1. (1) A German citizen who consciously and   unscrupulously, for his own gain or for other low motives,   contrary to legal provisions smuggles property abroad or leaves   property abroad and thus inflicts serious damage to German   economy is to be punished by death. His property will be   confiscated. The perpetrator is also punishable, if he commits   the misdeed abroad.[604]On 17 August 1938, more than a year before the invasion of Poland, adecree was promulgated against undermining German military efficiency.It provided in part:   Section 5. (1) The following shall be guilty of undermining   German military efficiency, and shall be punished by death:   1. Whoever openly solicits or incites others to evade the   fulfillment of compulsory military service in the German or an   allied armed force, or otherwise openly seeks to paralyze or   undermine the will of the German people or an allied nation to   self-assertion by bearing arms; * * *.[605]Under this law the death sentence was mandatory.By the decree of 1 September 1939 the ears of the German people werestopped lest they hear the truth:   Section 1.--Deliberate listening to foreign stations is   prohibited. Violations are punishable by hard labor. In less   severe cases there can be a sentence of imprisonment. The radio   receivers used will be confiscated.   Section 2.--Whoever deliberately spreads news from foreign   radio stations which is designed to undermine German military   efficiency will be punished by hard labor and in particularly   severe cases by death.[606]It is important to note that discretion as to penalty was vested in thecourt.On 5 September 1939, by the Decree Against Public Enemies, it wasprovided that looting in liberated territory may be punished byhanging. The following additional provisions are of importance becauseof the arbitrary manner in which the instrument was construed andapplied by the courts. The provisions are as follows:   Section 2.--Whoever commits a crime or offense against life,   limb or property, taking advantage of air raid protection   measures, is punishable by hard labor of up to 15 years or for   life, and in particularly severe cases punishable by death.   Section 3.--Whoever commits arson or any other crime of public   danger, thereby undermining German military efficiency, will be   punished by death.   Section 4.--Whoever commits a criminal act exploiting the   extraordinary conditions caused by war is punishable beyond the   regular punishment limits with hard labor of up to 15 years   or for life, or is punishable by death if the sound common   sense of the people requires it on account of the crime being   particularly despicable.[607]On 25 November 1939 the death penalty was authorized as punishment forintentionally or negligently causing damage to war materials and thelike, if it endangers the fighting power of the German armed forces.The death penalty was also authorized in case of anyone who disturbsor imperils the ordinary function of an enterprise essential to thedefense of the Reich or to the supply of the population.[608]On 5 December 1939 the death penalty was authorized for various crimesof violence and it was provided that this decree is also applicable tocrimes committed before it became valid.On 4 September 1941 the Criminal Code was supplemented and changed toprovide the death penalty for dangerous habitual criminals and sexcriminals if necessitated for the protection of the national communityor by the desire for just expiation. The decree was signed by AdolfHitler and by the defendant Dr. Schlegelberger in charge of the ReichMinistry of Justice.By the decree of 5 May 1944, the judges were substantially freed fromall restrictions as to the penalty to be invoked in criminal cases.That decree reads as follows:   With regard to all offenders who are guilty of causing serious   prejudice or seriously endangering the conduct of war, or the   security of the Reich, through an intentional criminal act, a   penalty may be imposed in excess of the regular penal limits   up to the statutory maximum for a given type of punishment, or   hard labor for a term or for life, or death, if the regular   statutory maximum limits are insufficient for expiation of the   act according to the sentiment of the people. The same shall   also apply to all offenses committed by negligence by which   one made himself guilty of a particularly grave prejudice or a   particularly serious danger to the conduct of war, or to the   security of the Reich.[609]On 20 August 1942 Hitler issued the famous decree which marks theculmination of his systematic campaign to change the German judicialsystem into an instrumentality of the NSDAP. The decree was as follows:   A strong administration of justice is necessary for the   fulfillment of the tasks of the great German Reich. Therefore,   I commission and empower the Reich Minister of Justice to   establish a National Socialist Administration of Justice and to   take all necessary measures in accordance with my directives   and instructions made in agreement with the Reich Minister and   Chief of the Reich Chancellery and the Leader of the Party   Chancellery. He can hereby deviate from any existing law.[610]The statutes which we have reviewed were merely steps in the processof increased severity of the criminal law and in the development of aloose concept concerning the definition of crime. The latter conceptwas especially evident in the statutes concerning the sound sentimentof the people, crime by analogy, and undermining the militaryefficiency of the nation. In place of the control of law there wassubstituted the control of National Socialist ideology as a guide tojudicial action.The Draconic laws to which we have referred were upon their face,of general applicability. The discriminations on political, racial,and religious grounds are to be found not in the text, but in theapplication of the text.But the Nazis were not content with statutes of a nondiscriminatorynature even in view of the discriminatory manner in which they wereenforced. Coincidentally with the development of these laws anddecrees there arose another body of substantive law which expresslydiscriminated against minority groups both within and without theReich, and which formed the basis for racial, religious, and politicalpersecution on a vast scale. On 7 April 1933, a decree by the Reichgovernment provided in part that--   Article 2. Persons who, according to the Law for the   Restoration of the Professional Civil Service of 7 April   1933,[611] are of non-Aryan descent, may be refused permission   to practice law, even if there exists none of the reasons   enumerated in the Regulations for Lawyers. The same rule applies   in cases, as where a lawyer described in section 1, clause 2,   wishes to be admitted to another court. * * *   Article 3. Persons who are active in the Communistic sense are   excluded from the admission to the bar. Admissions already given   have to be revoked.[612]The act was implemented by the power of injunction. The fact that thelicense to practice law had been canceled was also stated as a groundfor the cancellation of employment contracts and office leases.On 15 September 1935, the Reichstag enacted the Law for the Protectionof German Blood and Honor. We quote--   Article 1. (1) Marriages of Jews and citizens of German or   related blood are prohibited. Marriages which are concluded   nevertheless, are void even if they were concluded abroad in   order to circumvent this law.   (2) Only the district attorney can sue for nullification of   marriage.   Article 2. Sexual intercourse (except in marriage) between   Jews and German nationals of German or German-related blood is   forbidden.By other laws, as amended from time to time, non-Aryans were almostcompletely expelled from public service. The number of non-Aryans inschools and higher institutions of learning was restricted.[613] Jewswere excluded from the homestead law concerning peasantry.[614] Jewishreligious communities were regulated.[615] Jews were excluded fromcertain industrial enterprises[616] and their rights as tenants wererestricted.[617]By the act of 2 November 1942 it was provided--   Section 1. A Jew who has his domicile abroad cannot be a   citizen of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. Domicile   abroad is established if a Jew was abroad under circumstances   which indicated that his tenure there is not of a temporary   nature.   Section 2. A Jew loses his citizenship status in the   Protectorate if--   (a) As of the effective date of this decree, he has an   established domicile abroad;   (b) At a date subsequent to the effective date of this decree,   he establishes a domicile abroad.And by act of 25 November 1941 it was provided--   Section 3. (1) The property of the Jew who is losing his   nationality under this amendment shall be forfeited for the   benefit of the Reich at the moment he loses his nationality. The   Reich further confiscates the property of Jews who are stateless   at the moment this amendment becomes effective, and who were   last of German nationality, if they have or take up their   regular residence abroad.   (2) The property thus forfeited shall serve the furthering of   all purposes in connection with the solution of the Jewish   question.          *       *       *       *       *       *       *   Section 8. (1) It is for the chief of the Security Police and   the SD (of Reich Leader SS) to decide whether the conditions for   confiscation of property are given.   (2) The administration and liquidation of the forfeited property   is up to the Chief of the Regional Finance Office, Berlin.[618]The decree of 4 December 1941 concerning the organization and criminaljurisdiction against Poles and Jews in the Incorporated EasternTerritories,[619] marks perhaps the extreme limit to which the Nazigovernment carried its statutory and decretal persecution of racialand religious minorities, but it also introduces another element ofgreat importance. We refer to the extension of German laws to occupiedterritory, to purportedly annexed territory, and to territory of theso-called protectorates. The decree provides--   (1) Poles and Jews in the Incorporated Eastern Territories   are to conduct themselves in conformity with the German laws   and with the regulations introduced for them by the German   authorities. They are to abstain from any conduct liable to   prejudice the sovereignty of the German Reich or the prestige of   the German people.   (2) The death penalty shall be imposed on any Pole or Jew if he   commits an act of violence against a German on account of his   being of German blood.   (3) A Pole or Jew shall be sentenced to death, or in less   serious cases to imprisonment, if he manifests anti-German   sentiments by malicious activities or incitement, particularly   by making anti-German utterances, or by removing or defacing   official notices of German authorities or offices, or if he,   by his conduct, lowers or prejudices the prestige or the well   being of the German Reich or the German people.   (4) The death penalty, or in less serious cases imprisonment,   shall be imposed on any Jew or Pole:          *       *       *       *       *       *       *   3. If he urges or incites to disobedience to any decree or   regulation issued by the German authorities;   4. If he conspires to commit an act punishable under paragraphs   (2), (3) and (4), subsections 1 to 3, _or if he seriously   contemplates the carrying out of such an act_, or if he   offers himself to commit such an act, or accepts such an offer,   or if he obtains credible information of such act, or of the   intention of committing it, and fails to notify the authorities   or any person threatened thereby at a time when danger can still   be averted. [Emphasis added.]   II. Punishment shall also be imposed on Poles or Jews if they   act contrary to German criminal law or commit any act for which   they deserve punishment in accordance with the fundamental   principles of German criminal law and in view of the interests   of the State in the Incorporated Eastern Territories.   III. * * * (2) The death sentence shall be imposed in all cases   where it is prescribed by the law. Moreover, in these cases   where the law does not provide for the death sentence, it may   and shall be imposed if the offense points to particularly grave   for other reasons; the death sentence may also be passed upon   juvenile offenders.          *       *       *       *       *       *       *   XIV. (1) The provisions contained in sections I-IV of this   decree apply also to those Poles and Jews who on 1 September   1939 were domiciled or had their residence within the territory   of the former Polish State, and who committed criminal offenses   in any part of the German Reich other than the Incorporated   Eastern Territories. * * *It will be observed that the title of the foregoing act refers toPoles and Jews in the Incorporated Eastern Territories, but ArticleXIV makes the decree also applicable to acts by Poles and Jews withinany part of the German Reich, if on 1 September 1939 they weredomiciled within the former Polish State. This section was repeatedlyemployed by the courts in the prosecution of Poles.There was promulgated a thirteenth regulation under the Reichcitizenship law which illustrates the increasing severity by means ofwhich the government was attempting to reach a solution of the Jewishproblem under the impulsion of the progressively adverse militarysituation. This regulation, under date of 1 July 1943, provides:   Article 1. (1) Criminal actions committed by Jews shall be   punished by the police.   (2) The provision of the Polish penal laws of 4 December 1941   (RGBl. I, p. 759) shall no longer apply to Jews.   Article 2. (1) The property of a Jew shall be confiscated by   the Reich after his death.          *       *       *       *       *       *       *   Article 3. The Reich Minister of the Interior with the   concurrence of the participating higher authorities of the Reich   shall issue the legal and administrative provisions for the   administration and enforcement of this regulation. In doing so   he shall determine to what extent the provisions shall apply to   Jewish nationals of foreign countries.By Article 4 it was provided that in the Protectorate of Bohemia andMoravia the regulation shall apply where German administration andGerman courts have jurisdiction. (1943 RGBl. I, p. 372.)Not only did the Nazis enact special discriminatory laws against Polesand Jews and political minorities; they also enacted discriminatorylaws in favor of members of the Party. By the decree of 17 October1939, it was provided that for the area of the Greater German Reich,special jurisdiction in penal matters will be established for--   1. Professional members of the Reich leadership of the SS.   2. Professional members of the staffs of those Higher SS and   Police Chiefs who possess the authority of issuing orders in   those units which have been specially designated under numbers 3   to 6 below:   3. Members of the SS units for special purposes;   4. Members of the SS Death Head units (including their   reinforcements);   5. Members of the SS Junker schools;   6. Members of police units for special purposes.On 12 March 1938, the German Army invaded Austria. The methodsemployed were those of an aggressor.[620] On the next day Austriawas incorporated in the German Reich. As a result of the Munich pactof 29 September 1938, and of threatened invasion, Czechoslovakiawas compelled to cede the Sudetenland to Germany,[621] and on 16March 1939, Bohemia and Moravia were incorporated in the Reich as aprotectorate. On 1 September 1939, Poland was invaded and thereafteroccupied and, later on, Germany, by military force, occupied all orportions of Denmark, Norway, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg,Yugoslavia, Greece, and Russia. These occupations and annexationsfurnished the motive for an extension into many areas outside the oldReich of the draconic and discriminatory German laws which had beenput in force within the old Reich. By the act of 14 April 1939, it wasprovided:   Article II, section 6 (2). Persons who are not German nationals   are subject to German jurisdiction for offenses--   (a) to which German criminal law applies,   (b) if they are prosecuted under a private action provided the   action has been brought by a German national.          *       *       *       *       *       *       *   Section 7. German jurisdiction in the Protectorate of Bohemia   and Moravia excludes jurisdiction by the courts of the   Protectorate unless otherwise provided.The decree of 5 September 1939 against public enemies, _supra_,was made applicable in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia andalso for those persons who are not German citizens.By a decree of 25 November 1939 concerning damage to war material, itis provided in part:   Section 2. Whoever disturbs or imperils the ordinary function   of an enterprise essential to the defense of the Reich or to   the supply of the population in that he made a thing serving   the enterprise completely or partially unusable or put it out   of commission, shall be punished by hard labor or in especially   serious cases by death.          *       *       *       *       *       *       *   Section 6. In the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia the   provisions of sections 1, 2, * * * and 5 of this decree are   valid also for persons who are not nationals of the German   state.The decree on the extension of the application of criminal law of 6May 1940 provided in part:   [Article I, section 4] German criminal law will be applied   to the following crimes committed by a foreigner abroad,   independently of the laws of the place of commitment:   1. Crimes committed while holding a German governmental office,   as a German soldier or as member of the Reich Labor Service   (Reichsarbeitsdienst) or committed against a holder of a German   office of the State or the Party, against a German soldier or a   member of the Reich Labor Service, while on duty or relating to   his duty;   2. Actions constituting treason or high treason against   Germany; * * *.          *       *       *       *       *       *       *   [Article II] Paragraph 153. * * * A crime committed by a   foreigner abroad will be prosecuted by the public prosecutor   only if so demanded by the Reich Ministry of Justice. The   public prosecutor may abstain from the prosecution of a crime   if the same crime has already been punished abroad and if the   punishment has been carried out and the sentence to be expected   in Germany would, after deducting the time served abroad, not be   heavy.The act of 25 November 1941, _supra_, concerning the confiscationof Jewish property was made applicable in the Protectorate of Bohemiaand Moravia and in the Incorporated Eastern Territories.[622] Ofgreatest significance in this category was the law against Poles andJews already cited in another connection. The thirteenth regulationunder the Reich Citizenship Law of 1 July 1943, _supra_, was alsomade applicable within the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia whereGerman administration and German courts have jurisdiction. It was alsomade applicable to Jews who are citizens of the Protectorate. (Sec.4.)Thus far we have taken note of the substantive criminal law and itsextension to occupied and annexed territories, but these laws were notself-executing. For the accomplishment of the ends of aggressive war,the elimination of political opposition and the extermination of Jewsin all of Europe, it was deemed necessary to harness the Ministry ofJustice and the entire court system for the enforcement of the penallaws in accordance with National Socialist ideology.By decree of 21 March 1933 Special Courts were established withinthe district of every court of appeal. Their jurisdiction wasrapidly extended. It included the trial of cases arising under thedecree relating to the defense against insidious attacks against thegovernment of the national revolution.The decree of 21 March 1933 provided in part:   Section 3. (1) The Special Courts shall also be competent   if a crime within their jurisdiction represents also another   punishable deed.   (2) If another punishable act is factually connected with   a crime within the jurisdiction of the Special Courts, the   proceedings on that other punishable deed against delinquents   and participants may be referred to the Special Court by way of   connection.          *       *       *       *       *       *       *   Section 9. (1) No hearings relating to the warrant of arrest   will be held.          *       *       *       *       *       *       *   Section 10. For the defendant who has not yet chosen counsel,   counsel has to be appointed at the time when the date for the   trial is fixed.   Section 11. A preliminary court investigation will not take   place. * * *   Section 12. * * * (4) The term of the summons (section 217 of   the Code of Criminal Procedure) is 3 days. It can be shortened   to 24 hours.   Section 13. The Special Court can refuse any offer of evidence,   if the court has come to the conviction that the evidence is not   necessary for clearing up the case.   Section 14. The Special Court has to pass sentence even if   the trial results in showing the act of which the defendant is   accused, as not being under the jurisdiction of the Special   Court. This does not apply if the act constitutes a crime or   offense under the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court or the   courts of appeal; in this case the Special Court has to proceed   according to section 270, paragraph 12 of the Code of Criminal   Procedure.   Section 16. (1) There is no legal appeal against decisions of   the Special Courts.   (2) Applications for a reopening of the trial are to be   decided upon by the criminal chamber of the district court. The   reopening of the trial in favor of the defendant will also take   place if there are circumstances which point to the necessity of   reexamining the case in the ordinary procedure. The stipulation   of section 363 of the Code of Criminal Procedure remains   unaffected. If the application for the reopening of the trial   is justified, the trial will be ordered to take place before   the competent ordinary court.[623]Special Courts were also vested with jurisdiction under the law for theprotection against violent political acts of 4 April 1933 under whichthe death penalty was authorized.[624]On 1 September 1939 the Special Courts were given jurisdiction underthe law concerning listeners to foreign radio broadcasts, and the deathsentence was authorized in certain cases.[625] On 5 September 1939jurisdiction of the Special Court was extended to cases of looting, andthe death sentence was authorized. Jurisdiction was also extended tocases of criminal acts exploiting the extraordinary conditions causedby the war. That act further provided:   [Article 5] In all trials by Special Courts the verdict must   be pronounced at once without observation of time limitations   if the perpetrator is caught redhanded or if guilt is otherwise   obvious.[626]On 21 February 1940 the Special Courts were expressly givenjurisdiction concerning--   [Article 13] 1. Crime and offenses committed under the law of   20 December 1934 concerning treacherous attacks against State   and Party, and concerning protection of Party uniforms;   2. Crimes under section 239a of the Reich Criminal Code and   under the law of 22 June 1938 concerning highway robbery by   means of highway traps;   3. Crimes under the decree [1 September 1939] concerning   extraordinary measures in regard to radio;   4. Crimes and offenses under the war economy decree of 4   September 1939;   5. Crimes under section 1 of the decree of 5 September 1939   against public enemies;   6. Crimes under sections 1 and 2 of the decree of 5 December   1939 against violent criminals.[627]The decree further provided:   [Article 14] (1) The Special Court also has jurisdiction over   other crimes and offenses, if the prosecution is of the opinion   that immediate sentencing by the Special Court is indicated by   the gravity or the outrageousness of the act, on account of the   thereby-aroused public sentiment or in consideration of serious   threat to public order or security.   [Article 23] (1) In all proceedings before a Special Court the   sentence must be passed immediately without observation of any   reprieves, if the delinquent was caught in the very act or if   his guilt is self-evident otherwise.   (2) In all other cases the term of summons shall be 24 hours.   (Articles 217, 218 of the Reich Code of Criminal Procedure   (Reichsstrafprozessordnung)).   [Article 25] (1) The Special Court must hand down a decision   in a case, even if the trial shows that the act with which the   accused is charged is of such a nature that the Special Court   is not competent to deal with it. If, however, the trial shows   that the act comes under the jurisdiction of the Peoples Court,   the Special Court refers the matter to the latter court, by   decision; Article 270, section 2, of the Reich Code of Criminal   Procedure is applicable accordingly.   [Article 26] (1) There is no legal appeal against a decision of   the Special Court.   [Article 34] The chief public prosecutor may lodge a petition   for nullification with the Supreme Court (Reichsgericht) against   a final judgment of a judge of the criminal court of the Special   Court, within 1 year from the date of its becoming final, if the   judgment is not justified because of an erroneous application of   law on the established facts.   [Article 35] (1) The petition for nullification must be   submitted in writing to the Supreme Court. This court will   decide thereon by judgment based on a trial. With the consent of   the chief public prosecutor it can also reach a decision without   trial.   2. The Supreme Court may order a postponement or an   interruption of the execution. It may order arrest or internment   even prior to the decision on the petition for nullification.   The criminal senate (Strafsenat) composed of three members   including the president, will decide thereon without a trial,   with reservations as to the regulations of article 124, section   3 of the Reich Code of Criminal Procedure.[628]The speed with which the Special Courts acted is of significance. Inview of the congested dockets of the Special Courts, Freisler, actingfor the Minister of Justice, ordered, a Special Court is, as a rule,to be considered overloaded if a monthly average of more than forty newindictments has been filed with it.On 4 December 1941, in the law against Poles and Jews, _supra_, itwas provided:   IV. The State prosecutor shall prosecute a Pole or a Jew if he   considers that punishment is in the public interest.   V. (1) Poles and Jews shall be tried by a Special Court or by   the district judge.          *       *       *       *       *       *       *   VI. (1) Every sentence will be enforced without delay. The   State prosecutor may, however, appeal from the sentence of a   district judge to the court of appeal. The appeal has to be   lodged within 2 weeks.   (2) The right to lodge complaints which are to be heard by the   court of appeal is reserved exclusively to the State prosecutor.   VII. Poles and Jews cannot challenge a German judge on account   of alleged partiality.   VIII. * * * (2) During the preliminary inquiry, the State   prosecutor may order the arrest and any other coercive measures   permissible.   IX. Poles and Jews are not sworn in as witnesses in criminal   proceedings. If the unsworn deposition made by them before the   court is found false, the provisions as prescribed for perjury   and false statements shall be applied accordingly.   X. (1) Only the State prosecutor may apply for the reopening   of a case. In a case tried before a Special Court, the decision   concerning an application for the reopening of the proceedings   rests with this court.   (2) The right to lodge a plea of nullity rests with the State   prosecutor general. The decision on the plea rests with the   court of appeal.   XI. Poles and Jews are not entitled to act as prosecutors   either in a principal or a subsidiary capacity.   XII. The court and the State prosecutor shall conduct   proceedings within their discretion and according to the   principles of the German law of procedure. They may, however,   deviate from the provisions of the German law on the   organization of courts and on criminal procedure, whenever this   may appear to them advisable for the rapid and more efficient   conduct of proceedings.          *       *       *       *       *       *       *   XV. Within the meaning of this decree, the term Poles   includes Schutzangehoerige or those who are stateless.[629]It will be noted that the procedural rules became progressively moresummary and severe as the military situation became progressively morecritical.A major development in the Nazification of the judicial system appearsin the establishment of the Peoples Court which was subdivided intoa number of senates or departments. We quote:   When the Supreme Court acquitted three of the four defendants   charged with complicity in the Reichstag fire, its jurisdiction   in cases of treason was thereafter taken away and given to a   newly established Peoples Court consisting of two judges and   five officials of the Party.[630]The act of 24 April 1934 which established the highly flexibledefinitions of high treason also provided new judicial machinery forenforcement.   Article III, section 1. (1) For the trial of cases of high   treason the Peoples Court is established.   (2) Decisions of the Peoples Court are made by five members   during the trial, by three members outside the trial. This   includes the president. The president and one further   member must be qualified judges. Several senates may be   established.[631]In section 3 (1) of article III it is provided that the Peoples Courtis competent for the investigation and decision in the first and lastinstance in cases of high treason * * *, and in other specified cases.   Article III, section 3. (2) The Peoples Court is also   competent in such cases where crimes or offenses subject to its   competence constitute at the same time another punishable act.   (3) If another punishable act is in factual connection with a   crime or offense subject to the jurisdiction of the Peoples   Court, the trial against the perpetrators and participants of   the other punishable act may be brought before the Peoples   Court by way of combination of the respective cases.          *       *       *       *       *       *       *   [Article III] section 5. (2) Against the decisions of the   Peoples Court no appeal is permitted.On 1 December 1936, the jurisdiction of the Peoples Court wasextended to include violation of the law against economic sabotage.(_supra._)On 14 April 1939, the system was extended to Bohemia and Moravia. Wequote:   [Section 1] (2) Furthermore, the Supreme Reich Court and the   Peoples Court will carry out jurisdiction for the Protectorate   Bohemia and Moravia.[632]The extent of jurisdiction was defined as follows:   Section 6. (1) German nationals are subject to German   jurisdiction in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia.   (2) Persons who are not German nationals are subject to German   jurisdiction for offenses--   _1._ to which German criminal law applies,   _2._ if they are prosecuted under a private action   provided the action has been brought by a German national.          *       *       *       *       *       *       *   Section 7. German jurisdiction in the Protectorate of Bohemia   and Moravia excludes jurisdiction by the courts of the   Protectorate unless otherwise provided.   Section 8. The German courts in the Protectorate of Bohemia   and Moravia administer justice in the name of the German   people.[633]By the law of 16 September 1939, provision was made for extraordinaryappeal against final judgments. We quote in part:   Article 2, section 3. (1) Against legally valid sentences in   criminal proceedings the senior Reich prosecutor at the Reich   Supreme Court can file an appeal within one year after they have   been pronounced, if, because of serious misgiving, concerning   the justness of the sentence, he considers a new trial and a new   decision in the cases necessary.   (2) On the basis of the appeal, the Special Penal Senate of the   Reich Supreme Court will try the cases a second time.   (3) If the first sentence was passed by the Peoples Court,   the appeal is to be filed by the senior Reich prosecutor at   the Peoples Court, and the second trial is to be held by the   Special Senate of the Peoples Court. The same applies to the   sentences of courts of appeal in cases which the senior Reich   prosecutor at the Peoples Court had transferred to the public   prosecutor attached to the court of appeals, or which the   Peoples Court had transferred for trial and sentencing to the   courts of appeal.          *       *       *       *       *       *       *   Section 5. (1) The Special Senate of the Peoples Court   consists of the president and of four members.[634]On 21 February 1940 the jurisdiction of the Peoples Court wasredefined and again extended to cover high treason, treason, severecases of damaging war material, failure to report an intended crime,crimes under section 5 (1) of the decree of 28 February 1933 concerningprotection of people and State; crimes of economic sabotage, crime ofundermining German military efficiency, and others.On 6 May 1940 a broad decree was issued concerning the jurisdiction ofGerman courts for the territory of the Greater German Reich. Thatdecree provided:   German criminal law will be applied to the crime of a German   national, no matter whether it is committed in Germany or   abroad. For a crime committed abroad, which according to the   laws of the place of commitment is not punishable, German   criminal law will not be applied, unless such action would   constitute a crime according to the sound sentiment for justice   of the German people on account of the particular conditions   prevailing at the place of commitment.[635]          *       *       *       *       *       *       *   Paragraph 4. German criminal law will be applied also in case   of crimes committed by a foreigner in Germany.   German criminal law will be applied to crimes committed by a   foreigner abroad, if they are punishable according to the penal   code of the territory where they are committed, or if such   territory is not subject to any jurisdiction and if--   1. the criminal has obtained German nationality after the   crime, or   2. the crime is directed against the German people or a German   national, or   3. the criminal is apprehended in Germany and is not   extradited, although the nature of his crime would permit an   extradition.   German criminal law will be applied to the following crimes   committed by a foreigner abroad, independently of the laws of   the place of commitment:   1. Crimes committed while holding a German governmental office,   as a German soldier or as a member of the Reich Labor Service   (Reichsarbeitsdienst) or committed against a holder of a German   office or the State or the Party, against a German soldier or a   member of the Reich Labor Service, while on duty or relating to   his duty;   2. Actions constituting treason or high treason against   Germany, and in other special cases.Certain additional provisions intimately affecting the rights ofaccused persons deserve special mention.   Section 10. For the defendant, who has not yet chosen counsel,   counsel has to be appointed at the time when the date for the   trial is fixed.   Section 11. A preliminary court investigation will not take   place. * * *[636]By a decree of the Reich Minister of Justice, Dr. Thierack, on 13December 1944, it was provided:   Article 2, paragraph 12. Limited admittance of defense counsel.   (1) In any one criminal case, several lawyers or professional   representatives may not act side by side as chosen counsel for   one defendant.   (2) The rules about obligatory representation by defense   counsel do not apply. The presiding judge appoints a defense   counsel for the whole or part of the proceedings if the   difficulty of the material or legal problems require assistance   by a defense counsel, or if the defendant, in due consideration   of his personality, is unable to defend himself personally. * *   *[637]On 16 February 1934 it was provided that:   Article 2. The president of the Reich has the prerogatives for   _nulle prosequi_ and clemency (formerly held by the States).   Amnesties can be promulgated only by Reich law.[638]This centralization of the clemency powers marks a radical departurefrom the system which prevailed prior to 1933 and was the means bywhich the will of Hitler became a dominating force in the Ministry ofJustice and in the courts. Other provisions are as follows:   Even if the judgment has been contested only by the defendant   or his legal representative, or by the prosecution in his favor,   it can be changed against the interests of the defendant.[639]   In penal matters for which the Peoples Court, the superior   district court, or the court of assizes are competent,   preexamination is conducted upon application of the prosecution,   if, after due consideration, the prosecution thinks it necessary.   In other penal matters as well, preexamination takes place on   application of the prosecution. The prosecution should make   such an application only if unusual circumstances make it   necessary to have a judge conduct such preexamination.[640]An illuminating comment on the law is made by a German text writer.   A criminal case on which verdict has been passed must not   again become the subject of another criminal proceeding. This   exclusive effect pertains to the subject of the case both as   regards the crime and the criminal. * * * According to the   findings of the German supreme court and to the prevailing   theory in accord with these findings, the effect of _ne bis   in idem_ includes the history of the case submitted to   the court for verdict. * * * This theory, however, leads to   unbearable consequences. In order to avoid these unbearable   consequences some courts, recently, have permitted the breach of   the principle against double jeopardy in exceptional cases where   jeopardy of a second trial is necessitated by the sound sense of   justice. * * *[641]On 21 March 1942 Adolf Hitler promulgated a decree regarding thesimplification of the administration of justice. We quote the followingexcerpts:   In penal cases, * * * the formal opening of the main proceeding   must be eliminated. * * * (Sec. I.)   Indictments and judicial decisions must be more tersely written   by restricting them to the absolutely necessary. (Sec. II.)   The cooperation of professional associate judges in judicial   decisions must be restricted. (Sec. III.)   I commission the Reich Minister of Justice, in agreement   with the Reich Minister and Chief of the Reich Chancellery   and with the Chief of the Party Chancellery, to issue the   legal provisions necessary for the execution of this decree.   I empower the Reich Minister of Justice to make the necessary   administrative provisions and to decide any doubtful questions   by administrative means. (Sec. VI.)   On 13 August 1942 a decree was issued by the defendant   Schlegelberger as Reich Minister of Justice in charge of the   Ministry--   Article 4. * * * Decisions by the criminal court, the Special   Court, and the criminal senate of the circuit courts of appeal   may be made solely by the president or his regular deputy, if   he considers the cooperation of his associates dispensable in   view of the simplicity of the nature and the legal status of the   case, and if the public prosecutor agrees.   Article 5. Main proceeding without public prosecutor--In the   proceeding before the district judge, the public prosecutor may   renounce his participation in the main proceeding.   Article 7 (2). The validity of an objection is decided on by   the president of the deciding court. The admissibility of an   appeal is decided on by the president of the court of appeal   (Berufungsstrafkammer); he is also authorized to bring about a   decision of the court. These decisions are not subject to any   proof, and are incontestable.   Article 7 (3). Further objections will not be admitted.We have already quoted at length from the decree of 4 December 1941concerning the organization of criminal jurisdiction against Polesand Jews in the Incorporated Eastern Territories. That decree alsocontained provisions for the establishment of martial law from which wequote:   Article XIII (1). Subject to the consent of the Reich Minister   of the Interior and the Reich Minister of Justice, the Reich   governor may, until further notice, enforce martial law in the   Incorporated Eastern Territories, either in the whole area under   his jurisdiction or in parts thereof, upon Poles and Jews guilty   of grave excesses against the Germans or of other offenses which   seriously endanger the German work of reconstruction.   (2) The courts established under martial law impose the death   sentence. They may, however, dispense with punishment and refer   the case to the Secret State Police (Gestapo).A final step in the development of summary criminal procedure was takenon 15 February 1945 by a decree of the Reich Minister of Justice, Dr.Thierack. The decree provided:   II. 1. The court martial consists of a judge of a criminal   court as president and of a member of the political leader   corps, or of a leader of another structural division of the   NSDAP and an officer of the Wehrmacht, the Waffen SS, or the   police, as associate judges. * * *   III. 1. The courts martial have jurisdiction for all kinds of   crimes endangering the German fighting power or undermining the   peoples military efficiency. * * *   IV. 1. The sentence of the court martial will be either death,   acquittal, or commitment to the regular court. The consent of   the Reich defense commissar is required. He gives orders for the   time, place, and kind of execution. * * *[642]Pursuant to a decree of the Fuehrer of 16 March 1939, the defendantSchlegelberger, as Reich Minister of Justice in charge, together withthe Minister of the Interior and the Chief of the Armed Forces, Keitel,issued a decree which reads in part as follows:   Section 1. In case of direct attack by a non-German citizen   against the SS or the German Police or against any of their   members, the Reich Leader of the SS and the Chief of the German   Police in the Reich Ministry of the Interior may establish   the jurisdiction of a combined SS court and police court, by   declaring that special interests of parts of the SS or of the   Police require that judgment be given by an SS and police court.   This declaration shall be sent to the Reich Protector of   Bohemia and Moravia. The SS and police court, which shall have   jurisdiction in individual cases, shall be specified by the   Reich Leader of the SS and Chief of the German Police in the   Reich Ministry of the Interior.   Section 2. If the offense directly injures the interests of the   armed forces, the Reich Leader of the SS and chief of the German   Police in the Reich Ministry of the Interior, and the chief of   the Supreme Command of the Armed Forces shall reach an agreement   as to whether the case shall be prosecuted by an SS and police   court or by a military court.[643]   Article II. Exemption of the Reich court from being bound   to precedent sentence: The Reich Court as the highest German   tribunal must consider it its duty to effect an interpretation   of the law which takes into account the change of ideology and   of legal concepts which the new State has brought about. In   order to be able to accomplish this task without having to show   consideration for the jurisdiction of the past brought about by   other ideology and other legal concepts, it is ruled as follows:   When a decision is made about a legal question, the Reich Court   can deviate from a decision laid down before this law went into   effect.[644]                          _THE LAW IN ACTION_We pass now from the foregoing incomplete summary of Nazi legislationto a consideration of the law in action, and of the influence of theFuehrer principle as it affected the officials of the Ministry ofJustice, prosecutors, and judges. Two basic principles controlledconduct within the Ministry of Justice. The first concerned theabsolute power of Hitler in person or by delegated authority to enact,enforce, and adjudicate law. The second concerned the incontestabilityof such law. Both principles were expounded by the learned ProfessorJahrreiss, a witness for all of the defendants. Concerning the firstprinciple, Dr. Jahrreiss said:   If now in the European meaning one asks about legal   restrictions, and first of all one asks about restrictions   of the German law, one will have to say that restrictions   under German law did not exist for Hitler. He was _legibus   solutus_ in the same meaning in which Louis XIV claimed that   for himself in France. Anybody who said something different   expresses a wish that does not describe the actual legal facts.Concerning the second principle, Jahrreiss supported the opinion ofGerhard Anschuetz, crown jurist of the Weimar Republic, who holdsthat if German laws were enacted by regular procedure, judicialauthorities were without power to challenge them on constitutional orethical grounds. Under the Nazi system, and even prior thereto, Germanjudges were also bound to apply German law even when in violation ofthe principles of international law. As stated by Professor Jahrreiss:   To express it differently, whether the law has been passed   by the State in such a way that it was inconsistent with   international law on purpose or not, that could not play   any part at all; and that was the legal state of affairs,   regrettable as it may be.This, however, is not to deny the superior authority of internationallaw. Again we quote a statement of extraordinary candor by ProfessorJahrreiss:   On the other hand, certainly there were legal restrictions   for Hitler under international law. * * * He was bound by   international law. Therefore, he could commit acts violating   international law. Therefore, he could issue orders violating   international law to the Germans.The conclusion to be drawn from the evidence presented by thedefendants themselves is clear: In German legal theory Hitlers law wasa shield to those who acted under it, but before a tribunal authorizedto enforce international law, Hitlers decrees were a protectionneither to the Fuehrer himself nor to his subordinates, if in violationof the law of the community of nations.In German legal theory, Hitler was not only the supreme legislator,he was also the supreme judge. On 26 April 1942 Hitler addressed theReichstag in part as follows:   I do expect one thing: That the nation gives me the right to   intervene immediately and to take action myself wherever a   person has failed to render unqualified obedience. * * *   I therefore ask the German Reichstag to confirm expressly that   I have the legal right to keep everybody to his duty and to   cashier or remove from office or position without regard for   his person, or his established rights, whoever, in my view and   according to my considered opinion, has failed to do his duty.   * * * From now on, I shall intervene in these cases and remove   from office those judges who evidently do not understand the   demand of the hour.   On the same day the Greater German Reichstag resolved in part as   follows:   * * * the Fuehrer must have all the rights postulated by him   which serve to further or achieve victory. Therefore--without   being bound by existing legal regulations--in his capacity as   leader of the nation, Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces,   governmental chief and supreme executive chief, as supreme   justice[645], and leader of the Party--the Fuehrer must be in a   position to force with all means at his disposal every German,   if necessary, whether he be common soldier or officer, low or   high official or judge, leading or subordinate official of   the Party, worker or employee, to fulfill his duties. In case   of violation of these duties, the Fuehrer is entitled after   conscientious examination, regardless of so-called well-deserved   rights, to mete out due punishment, and to remove the offender   from his post, rank and position, without introducing prescribed   procedures.The assumption by Hitler of supreme governmental power in alldepartments did not represent a new development based on the emergencyof war. The declaration of the Reichstag was only an echo of Hitlersdeclaration of 13 July 1934. After the mass murders of that date (theRoehm purge) which were committed by Hitlers express orders, he said:   Whenever someone reproaches me with not having used the   ordinary court for their sentencing, I can only say: In this   hour I am responsible for the fate of the German nation and   hence the supreme law lord[645] of the German people.The conception of Hitler as the supreme judge was supported by thedefendant Rothenberger. We quote (_NG-075, Pros. Ex. 27_):   However, something entirely different has occurred; with the   Fuehrer a man has risen within the German people who awakens the   oldest, long forgotten times. Here is a man who in his position   represents the ideal of the judge in its perfect sense, and   the German people elected him for their judge--first of all,   of course, as judge over their fate in general, but also as   supreme magistrate[645] and judge.In the same document the defendant Rothenberger expounded the NationalSocialist theory of judicial independence. He said:   Upon the fact that the judge can use his own discretion is   founded the magic of the word judge.He asserted that every private and Party official must abstain fromall interference or influence upon the judgment, but this statementappears to be mere window-dressing, for after his assertion that ajudge must judge like the Fuehrer, he said:   In order to guarantee this, a direct liaison officer without   any intermediate agency must be established between the Fuehrer   and the German judge, that is, also in the form of a judge, the   supreme judge in Germany, the Judge of the Fuehrer. He is to   convey to the German judge the will of the Fuehrer by authentic   explanation of the laws and regulations. At the same time he   must upon the request of the judge give binding information in   current trials concerning fundamental political, economic, or   legal problems which cannot be surveyed by the individual judge.Thus, it becomes clear that the Nazi theory of the judicialindependence was based upon the supreme independence of the Fuehrer,which was to be channelized through the proposed liaison officer fromFuehrer to judge.On 13 November 1934, Goering, in an address before the Academy ofGerman Law, expressed similar sentiments concerning the position ofHitler.   Gentlemen, for the German nation this matter was settled by the   words of the judge in this hour, the Fuehrer, who stated that in   this hour of uttermost danger he alone, the Fuehrer elected by   the people, was the supreme and only judge of the German nation.The defendant Schlegelberger, on 10 March 1936 said:   It should be emphasized, however, that in the sphere of the   law, also, it is the Fuehrer and he alone who sets the pace of   development.To the same effect we quote Reich Minister of Justice Dr. Thierack,who, on 5 January 1943 said:   So also with us the conviction has grown in these 10 years in   which the Fuehrer has led the German people that the Fuehrer is   the chief justice and the supreme judge of the German people.On 17 February 1943 the defendant Under Secretary Dr. Rothenbergersummed up his legal philosophy with the words (_NG-415, Pros. Ex.26_):   The judge is on principle bound by the law. The laws are the   orders of the Fuehrer.As will be seen, the foregoing pronouncement by the leaders in thefield of Nazi jurisprudence were not mere idle theories. Hitler did, infact, exercise the right assumed by him to act as supreme judge, andin that capacity in many instances he controlled the decision of theindividual criminal cases.The evidence demonstrates that Hitler and his top-ranking associateswere by no means content with the issuance of general directives forthe guidance of the judicial process. They tenaciously insisted uponthe right to interfere in individual criminal sentences. In discussingthe right to refuse confirmation of sentences imposed by criminalcourts, Martin Bormann, as Chief of the Party Chancellery, wrote to Dr.Lammers, Chief of the Reich Chancellery, as follows (_NG-102, Pros.Ex. 75_):   When the Fuehrer has expressly requested the right of   direct interference over all formal legal provisions, this   is emphasizing the very importance of the modification of a   judicial sentence.The Ministry of Justice was acutely conscious of the interferenceby Hitler in the administration of criminal law. On 10 March 1941Schlegelberger wrote to Reich Minister Lammers in part as follows(_NG-152, Pros. Ex. 63_):   It has come to my knowledge that just recently a number of   sentences passed have roused the strong disapproval of the   Fuehrer. I do not know exactly which sentences are concerned,   but I have ascertained for myself that now and then sentences   are pronounced, which are quite untenable. In such cases I   shall act with the utmost energy and decision. It is, however,   of vital importance for justice and its standing in the Reich,   that the head of the Ministry of Justice should know to which   sentences the Fuehrer objects, * * *.On the same date Schlegelberger wrote to Hitler in part as follows(_NG-152, Pros. Ex. 63_):   In the course of the verdicts pronounced daily, there are   still judgments which do not entirely comply with the necessary   requirements. In such cases I will take the necessary steps. * *   *   Apart from this it is _desirable to educate the judges more   and more to a correct way of thinking, conscious of the national   destiny_. For this purpose it would be invaluable, if you, my   Fuehrer, could let me know if a verdict does not meet with your   approval. The judges are responsible to you, my Fuehrer; they   are conscious of this responsibility, and are firmly resolved   to discharge their duties accordingly. * * * Heil, my Fuehrer!   [Emphasis added.]Hitler not only complied with the foregoing request, but proceededbeyond it. Upon his personal orders persons who had been sentenced toprison terms were turned over to the Gestapo for execution. We quotebriefly from the testimony of Dr. Hans Gramm, who for many years waspersonal Referent to the defendant Schlegelberger, and who testified inhis behalf.   Q. Do you know anything about transfers of condemned persons to   the police, or to the Gestapo?   A. I know that it frequently occurred that Hitler gave orders   to the police to call for people who had been sentenced to   prison terms. To be sure, it was an order from Hitler directed   to the police to the effect that the police had to take such and   such a man into their custody. These orders had rather short   limits. As a rule, there was only a time limit of 24 hours   before execution by the police, after which the police had to   report that it had been executed. These transfers, as far as   I can remember, took place only during the war. (_Tr. pp.   47174718._)This procedure was well-known in the Ministry of Justice. Gramm wasinformed by the defendant Schlegelberger that the previous ReichMinister of Justice, Dr. Guertner, had protested to Dr. Lammers againstthis procedure and had received the reply--   That the courts could not stand up to the special requirements   of the war, and that therefore these transfers would have to   continue.The only net result of the protest was that from that time on in everyindividual case when such a transfer had been ordered, the Ministry ofJustice was informed about that.The witness, Dr. Lammers, former Chief of the Reich Chancellery, whosehostility toward the prosecution and evasiveness were obvious, concededthat the practice was continued under Schlegelberger, though Lammersstated that Schlegelberger never agreed to it.By reference to case histories we will illustrate three differentmethods by which Hitler, through the Ministry of Justice, imposedhis will in disregard of judicial proceedings. One, Schlitt, hadbeen sentenced to a prison term, as a result of which Schlegelbergerreceived a telephone call from Hitler protesting the sentence. Inresponse the defendant Schlegelberger on 24 March 1942 wrote in part asfollows (_NG-152, Pros. Ex. 63_):   I entirely agree with your demand, my Fuehrer, for very severe   punishment for crime, and I assure you that the judges honestly   wish to comply with your demand. Constant instructions in order   to strengthen them in this intention and the increase of threats   of legal punishment have resulted in a considerable decrease of   the number of sentences to which objections have been made from   this point of view, out of a total annual number of more than   300,000.   I shall continue to try to reduce this number still more, and   if necessary, I shall not shrink from personal measures, as   before.   In the criminal case against the building technician, Ewald   Schlitt, from Wilhelmshaven, I have applied through the public   prosecutor for an extraordinary plea for nullification against   the sentence, at the special senate of the Reich Court. I will   inform you of the verdict of the special senate immediately it   has been given.On 6 May 1942, Schlegelberger informed Hitler (_NG-102, Pros. Ex.75_) that the 10-year sentence against Schlitt was quashed within10 days; and that Schlitt was sentenced to death and executed atonce.In the case against Anton Scharff, the sentence of 10 years penalservitude had been imposed. Thereupon, on 25 May 1941, Bormann wrote toDr. Lammers (_NG-611, Pros. Ex. 64_): The Fuehrer believes thissentence entirely incomprehensible * * *. The Fuehrer requests that youinform State Secretary Schlegelberger again of his point of view.On 28 June 1941, defendant Schlegelberger wrote Dr. Lammers (_NG-611,Pros. Ex. 64_): I am very obliged to the Fuehrer for informing me,on my request, of his conception of atonements of black-out crimes inreference to the sentence of the Munich Special Court against AntonScharff.   I shall reinstruct the presidents of the courts of appeal and   the chief public prosecutors of this conception of the Fuehrer   as soon as possible.As a final illustration of a general practice, we refer to the case ofthe Jew Luftgas, who had been sentenced to 2 years imprisonment forhoarding eggs. On 25 October 1941, Lammers notified Schlegelberger:The Fuehrer wishes that Luftgas be sentenced to death. On 29 October1941, Schlegelberger wrote Lammers: * * * I have handed over to theGestapo for the purpose of execution the Jew Markus Luftgas who hadbeen sentenced to 2 years of imprisonment * * *.Although Hitlers personal intervention in criminal cases was amatter of common occurrence, his chief control over the judiciary wasexercised by the delegation of his power to the Reich Minister ofJustice, who on 20 August 1942 was expressly authorized to deviatefrom any existing law.Among those of the Ministry of Justice who joined in the constantpressure upon the judges in favor of more severe or more discriminatoryadministration of justice, we find Thierack, Schlegelberger, Klemm,Rothenberger, and Joel. Neither the threat of removal nor the sporadiccontrol of criminal justice in individual cases was sufficient tosatisfy the requirements of the Ministry of Justice. As stated by thedefendant Rothaug, only during 1942, after Thierack took over theMinistry, the guidance of justice was begun. * * * There was anattempt to guide the administration of justice uniformly from above.In September 1942 Thierack commenced the systematic distribution to theGerman judges of Richterbriefe. The first letter to the judges underdate of 1 October 1942 called their attention to the fact that Hitlerwas the supreme judge and that leadership and judgeship have relatedcharacters. We quote (_NG-298, Pros. Ex. 81_):   A corps of judges like this will not slavishly use the crutches   of law. It will not anxiously search for support by the law,   but, with a satisfaction in its responsibility, it will find   within the limits of the law the decision which is the most   satisfactory for the life of the community.In the Judges Letters Thierack discussed particular decisions whichhad been made in the various courts and which failed to conform toNational Socialist ideology. As an illustration of the type of guidancewhich was furnished by the Ministry of Justice to the German judiciary,we cite a few instances from the Richterbriefe.A letter to the judges of 1 October 1942 discusses a case decided in adistrict court on 24 November 1941. A special coffee ration had beendistributed to the population of a certain town. A number of Jewsapplied for the coffee ration, but did not receive it, being excludedfrom the distribution _per se_. The food authorities imposedfines upon the Jews for making the unsuccessful application. In 500cases the Jews appealed to the court and the judge informed the foodauthorities that the imposition of a fine could not be upheld forlegal reasons, one of which was the statute of limitations. In decidingfavorably to the Jews, the court wrote a lengthy opinion stating thatthe interpretation on the part of the food authorities was absolutelyincompatible with the established facts. We quote, without comment, thediscussion of the Reich Minister of Justice concerning the manner inwhich the case was decided (_NG-298, Pros. Ex. 81_):   The ruling of the district court, in form and content matter,   borders on embarrassing a German administrative authority to   the advantage of Jewry. The judge should have asked himself   the question: What is the reaction of the Jew to this 20-page   long ruling, which certifies that he and the 500 other Jews   are right and that he won over a German authority, and does   not devote one word to the reaction of our own people to this   insolent and arrogant conduct of the Jews. Even if the judge was   convinced that the food office had arrived at a wrong judgment   of the legal position, and if he could not make up his mind   to wait with his decision until the question, if necessary,   was clarified by the higher authorities, he should have chosen   a form for his ruling which under any circumstances avoided   harming the prestige of the food office and thus putting the Jew   expressly in the right toward it.One of the Richterbriefe also discusses the case of a Jew who, afterthe Aryanization of his firm, attempted to get funds transferredto Holland without a permit. He also attempted to conceal some ofhis assets. Concerning this case the judges of Germany received thefollowing guidance (_NG-298, Pros. Ex. 81_):   The court applies the same criteria for the award of punishment   as it would if it were dealing with a German fellow citizen as   defendant. This cannot be sanctioned. The Jew is the enemy of   the German people, who has plotted, stirred up, and prolonged   this war. In doing so, he has brought unspeakable misery upon   our people.   Not only is he of a different race, but he is also of inferior   race. Justice, which must not measure different matters by the   same standard, demands that just this racial aspect must be   considered in the award of punishment.Space does not permit the citation of other instances of this form ofperverted political guidance of the courts. Notwithstanding solemnprotestations on the part of the minister that the independence ofthe judge was not to be affected, the evidence satisfies us beyond areasonable doubt that the purpose of the judicial guidance was sinisterand was known to be such by the Ministry of Justice and by the judgeswho received the directions. If the letters [the Judges Letters]had been written in good faith with the honest purpose of aidingindependent judges in the performance of their duties, there wouldhave been no occasion for the carefully guarded secrecy with whichthe letters were distributed. A letter of 17 November 1942 instructsthe judges that the letters are to be carefully locked up to avoidthat they get into the hands of unauthorized persons. The receiversare subject to official secrecy as far as the contents of the judgesletters are concerned.In a letter of 17 November 1942 Thierack instructs the judges thatin cases where judges and prosecutors are suspected of politicalunreliability they are to be excluded in a suitable manner from thelist of subscribers to the Judges Letters.Not being content with regimenting the judges and chief prosecutors andmaking them subservient to the National Socialist administration ofjustice, Dr. Thierack next took up the regimentation of the lawyers.On 11 March 1943 he wrote to the various judges and prosecutorsannouncing the proposed distribution of confidential lawyers letters.An examination of those letters convinces the Tribunal that the actual,though undeclared purpose, was to suggest to defense counsel that theyavoid any criticism of National Socialist justice and refrain from toomuch ardor in the defense of persons charged with political crimes.Not only did Thierack exert direct influence upon the judges, but heemployed as his representative the most sinister, brutal, and bloodyjudge in the entire German judicial system. In a letter to Freisler,president of the Peoples Court, Thierack said that the judgment ofthe Peoples Court must be in harmony with the leadership of theState. He urges Freisler to have every charge submitted to him andto recognize the cases in which it was necessary in confidential andconvincing discussion with the judge competent for the verdict toemphasize what is necessary from the point of view of the State. Hecontinues:   As a general rule, the judge of the Peoples Court must   get used to regarding the ideas and intentions of the State   leadership as the primary factor and the individual fate which   depends on him as only a secondary factor. * * *He continues:   I will try to illustrate this with individual cases.   1. If a Jew--and a leading Jew at that--is charged with high   treason--even if he is only an accomplice therein, he has behind   him the hate and the will of Jewry to exterminate the German   people. As a rule this will therefore be _high treason_ and   must be punished by the death penalty.He concludes with the following admonition to Freisler, which appearsto have been wholly unnecessary:   In case you should ever be in doubt as to which line to follow   or which political necessities to take into consideration,   please address yourself to me in all confidence.It will be recalled that on 26 April 1942 Hitler stated that he wouldremove from office those judges who evidently do not understand thedemand of the hour. The effect of this pronouncement upon such judgesas still retained ideals of judicial independence can scarcely beoverestimated. The defendant Rothenberger stated it was absolutelycrushing.In a private letter to his brother, the defendant Oeschey expressed hisview of the situation created by Hitlers interference in the followingwords:   After the well known Fuehrer speech things developed in a   frightful manner. I was never a supporter of the stubborn   doctrine of the independence of the judge which granted the   judge within the frame of the law the position of a public   servant, only subordinated to his conscience but otherwise   neutral, that is, politically completely independent. * *   * Now it is an absurdity to tell the judge in an individual   case which is subject to his decision how he has to decide.   Such a system would make the judge superfluous; such things   have now come to pass. Naturally it was not done in an open   manner; but even the most camouflaged form could not hide the   fact that a directive was to be given. Thereby the office of   judge is naturally abolished and the proceedings in a trial   become a farce. I will not discuss who bears the guilt of such a   development.The threat alone of the removal was sufficient to impair theindependence of the judges, but the evidence discloses that measureswere actually carried out for the removal or transfer of judgeswho proved unsatisfactory from the Party standpoint. On 29 March1941 Schlegelberger received a letter from the chief of the ReichChancellery protesting against the sentence which had been imposedagainst the Polish farmhand Wojcieck. The court at Lueneburg hadrecognized some extenuating circumstances in the case. Schlegelbergerwas advised as follows:   The Fuehrer urges you immediately to take the steps necessary   to preclude repetition in other courts of the view of the   Lueneburg court.On 1 April 1941 Schlegelberger wrote to the Chief of the ReichChancellery informing him that by means of a circular with the orderfor immediate transmittal to all judges and public prosecutors, Ibrought the mistake in the viewpoint as it is shown in this passageof the courts statement to the knowledge of the penal justice withoutdelay. I consider it impossible that such an incident will occur again.Schlegelberger ordered the responsible president of the appellate courtand the judges concerned in the case to report to him on the next day,and on the third day of April 1941 he advised as follows:   * * * I beg to inform you that the presiding judge of the   criminal division which passed the sentence in the case of the   Polish farmhand Wolay Wojciesk, is no longer chairman, and the   two associate judges have been replaced by other associate   judges.There is substantial evidence to the effect that the witnessOstermeier, who was a judge on the Special Court in Nuernberg, wasremoved from his office because of his lenient attitude in criminalcases.In a letter addressed to the Chief of the Reich Chancellery and to thehead of the Party Chancellery on 20 October 1942, Thierack discussedthe necessity of the removal or the transfer of officials in theMinistry of Justice who are not suited for the new tasks and addsthat it may become necessary in some particular cases to transfer orretire such judges as cannot be kept in their present positions. Hetherefore asked approval so that in urgent cases judges and officialsof the Reich administration of justice may be transferred by me toother positions * * * or may be retired by me.On 3 March 1942 Bormann gave his approval in general terms toThieracks proposal. A like approval was given by Dr. Lammers on 13November 1942.In connection with the discussion of removals, we find a list ofproposed staff reductions in which seventy-five judges and prosecutorsare named. Among the reasons stated for reduction we find thefollowing: persons of Jewish ancestry, 4; persons having a Jewish wife,4; lack of cooperation with Party, 4; religious grounds, 1; not a Partymember, 20; pro-Jewish or pro-Pole, 4.The conception of the national leadership of the Reich concerning thefunction of the law under the influence of the Party ideology must alsobe briefly noted.On 22 July 1942 Reich Minister Dr. Goebbels addressed the membersof the Peoples Court. The speech was reported in part as follows(_NG-417, Pros. Ex. 23_):   While making his decisions the judge had to proceed less from   the law than from the basic idea that the offender was to be   eliminated from the community. During a war it was not so much a   matter of whether a judgment was just or unjust but only whether   the decision was expedient. The State must ward off its internal   foes in the most efficient way and wipe them out entirely. The   idea that the judge must be convinced of the defendants guilt   must be discarded completely. The purpose of the administration   of the law was not in the first place retaliation or even   improvement but maintenance of the State. One must not proceed   from the law but from the resolution that the man must be wiped   out.On 14 September 1935 Hans Frank, Reichsleiter of the Nazi Party andpresident of the Academy of German law, said (_NG-777, Pros. Ex.19_):   By means of the law of 18 June 1935, the liberalist foundation   of the old penal code no penalty without a law was definitely   abandoned and replaced by the postulate, no crime without   punishment, which corresponds to our conception of the law.   In the future, criminal behavior, even if it does not fall   under formal penal precepts, will receive the deserved   punishment if such behavior is considered punishable according   to the healthy feelings of the people.This is the Hans Frank (since hanged) who at his trial testifiedconcerning the racial persecution in which he had participated. He said:   A thousand years will pass and this guilt of Germany will still   not be erased.On 10 March 1936 the defendant Schlegelberger said (_NG-538, Pros.Ex. 21_):   In the sphere of criminal law the road to a creation of justice   in harmony with the moral concepts of the new Reich has been   opened up by a new wording of section 2 of the criminal code,   whereby a person is also to be punished even if his deed is not   punishable according to the law, but if he deserves punishment   in accordance with the basic concepts of criminal law and the   sound instincts of the people. This new definition became   necessary because of the rigidity of the norm in force hitherto.Reich Minister Thierack on 5 January 1943 said (_NG-275, Pros Ex.25_):   The inner law of the guardian of justice is national socialism;   the written law is only to be an aid to the interpretation of   National Socialist ideas.In the words of the defendant Rothenberger the project was toorganize Europe anew and to create a new world philosophy. Again, hesaid (_NG-075, Pros. Ex. 27_):   * * * this reaction of antagonism toward law is justified   because the _present moment_ absolutely demands a rigid   restriction of the power of law. He who is striding gigantically   toward a new world order cannot move in the limitation of an   orderly administration of justice.Strangely enough we find the Nazi judicial system condemned by a judgewho in practice was its most fanatical adherent. The defendant Rothaugtestified as follows:   As of every other civil servant, of the judge there was   demanded not only obedience but also loyalty and an inner   connection with the doctrine of the State. The change-over   of the judiciary to that different intellectual level was   attempted _via_ the political factor of the administration   of justice, and that was when things came to grief; and it was   then that the notorious back door which I have mentioned, took   effect.After discussing the extraordinary legal remedies by which finaljudgments in criminal cases were set aside by means of thenullification plea and the extraordinary objection, Rothaug said:   As far as that went no objections could be made. What was more   dangerous was the influence by means of Judges Letters and the   guidance of jurisdiction.To the domination by Hitler and the political guidance of theMinistry of Justice must be added the direct pressure of Partyfunctionaries and police officials. The record is replete withtestimony of specific instances of interference in the administrationof justice by officials of Party and police. But for the demonstrationof the viciousness and universality of the practice it is onlynecessary to cite the words of the defendants themselves.The defendant Rothenberger describes the manner in which theadministration of justice was burdened by the Party and by the SS,and referred in his testimony to the thousand little Hitlers who everyday jeopardized the independence of the individual judge.The defendant Schlegelberger spoke with more caution:   If in a trial, testimonials of political conduct were submitted   for the characterization of the accused, it has to be left to   the judges dexterity to avoid conflict with the department   which furnishes the testimonial of political conduct.The defendant Lautz testified concerning attempted interferencewith his duties by the SS. We have already quoted the opinion of thedefendant Oeschey as expressed in a letter to his brother.A reliable witness, Dr. Hanns Anschuetz, testified:   After the issuance of the German Civil Service Code, strong   pressure was brought to bear upon all officials, including   judges, to join the NSDAP, or not to reject requests to join;   otherwise there existed the danger that they might be retired   or dismissed. But once a Party member, a judge was under Party   discipline and Party jurisdiction, which dominated his entire   life as official and as private person.The witness Wilhelm Oehlicker, formerly a justice official and atpresent judge in Hamburg, testified, that, the longer the warproceeded, in my opinion the more and more they (Party officials) triedto interfere with the courts and influence the courts directly.The final degradation of the judiciary is disclosed in a secretcommunication by Ministerial Director Letz of the Reich Ministry ofJustice to Dr. Vollmer, also a ministerial director in the department.Not only were the judges guided and at times coerced; they were spiedupon. We quote:   Moreover, I know from documents, which the minister produces   from time to time out of his private files, that the Security   Service takes up special problems of the administration of   justice with thoroughness and makes summarized situation reports   about them. As far as I am informed, a member of the Security   Service is attached to each judicial authority. This member is   obliged to give information under the seal of secrecy. This   procedure is secret and the person who gives the information is   not named. In this way we get, so to say, anonymous reports.   Reasons given for this procedure are of State political   interest. As long as the direct interests of the State security   are concerned, nothing can be said against it, especially in   wartime.In view of the conclusive proof of the sinister influences which werein constant interplay between Hitler, his ministers, the Ministryof Justice, the Party, the Gestapo, and the courts, we see no meritin the suggestion that Nazi judges are entitled to the benefit ofthe Anglo-American doctrine of judicial immunity. The doctrine thatjudges are not personally liable for their judicial actions is basedon the concept of an independent judiciary administering impartialjustice. Furthermore, it has never prevented the prosecution of a judgefor malfeasance in office. If the evidence cited _supra_ doesnot demonstrate the utter destruction of judicial independence andimpartiality, then we never writ nor no man ever proved. The functionof the Nazi courts was judicial only in a limited sense. They moreclosely resembled administrative tribunals acting under directives fromabove in a quasi-judicial manner.In operation the Nazi system forced the judges into one of twocategories. In the first we find the judges who still retained idealsof judicial independence and who administered justice with a measureof impartiality and moderation. Judgments which they rendered wereset aside by the employment of the nullity plea and the extraordinaryobjection. The defendants they sentenced were frequently transferredto the Gestapo on completion of prison terms and were then shot orsent to concentration camps. The judges themselves were threatened andcriticized and sometimes removed from office. In the other categorywere the judges who with fanatical zeal enforced the will of the Partywith such severity that they experienced no difficulties and littleinterference from party officials. To this group the defendants Rothaugand Oeschey belonged.We turn to a consideration and classification of the evidence. Theprosecution has introduced captured documents in great number whichestablish the Draconic character of the Nazi criminal laws and provethat the death penalty was imposed by courts in thousands of cases.Cases in which the extreme penalty was imposed may in large measure beclassified in the following groups:1. Cases against habitual criminals.2. Cases of looting in the devastated areas of Germany; committed afterair raids and under cover of black-out.3. Crimes against the war economy--rationing, hoarding, and the like.4. Crimes amounting to an undermining of the defensive strength of thenation; defeatist remarks, criticisms of Hitler, and the like.5. Crimes of treason and high treason.6. Crimes of various types committed by Poles, Jews, and otherforeigners.7. Crimes committed under the Nacht und Nebel program, and similarprocedures.Consideration will next be given to the first four groups as above setforth. The Tribunal is keenly aware of the danger of incorporating inthe judgment as law its own moral convictions or even those of theAnglo-American legal world. This we will not do. We may and do condemnthe Draconic laws and express abhorrence at the limitations imposed bythe Nazi regime upon freedom of speech and action, but the questionstill remains unanswered: Do those Draconic laws or the decisionsrendered under them constitute war crimes or crimes against humanity?Concerning the punishment of habitual criminals, we think the answeris clear. In many civilized states statutory provisions requirethe courts to impose sentences of life imprisonment upon proof ofconviction of three or more felonies. We are unable to say in onebreath that life imprisonment for habitual criminals is a salutaryand reasonable punishment in America in peace times, but that theimposition of the death penalty was a crime against humanity in Germanywhen the nation was in the throes of war. The same considerations applylargely in the case of looting. Every nation recognizes the absolutenecessity of more stringent enforcement of the criminal law in timesof great emergency. Anyone who has seen the utter devastation of thegreat cities of Germany must realize that the safety of the civilianpopulation demanded that the werewolves who roamed the streets of theburning cities, robbing the dead, and plundering the ruined homesshould be severely punished. The same considerations apply, though in alesser degree, to prosecutions to hoarders and violators of war economydecrees.Questions of far greater difficulty are involved when we consider thecases involving punishment for undermining military efficiency. Thelimitations on freedom of speech which were imposed in the enforcementof these laws are revolting to our sense of justice. A court would haveno hesitation in condemning them under any free constitution, includingthat of the Weimar republic, if the limitations were applied in timeof peace; but even under the protection of the Constitution of theUnited States a citizen is not wholly free to attack the Government orto interfere with its military aims in time of war. In the face of areal and present danger, freedom of speech may be somewhat restrictedeven in America. Can we then say that in the throes of total war and inthe presence of impending disaster those officials who enforced thesesavage laws in a last desperate effort to stave off defeat were guiltyof crimes against humanity?It is persuasively urged that the fact that Germany was waging acriminal war of aggression colors all of these acts with the dye ofcriminality. To those who planned the war of aggression and who werecharged with and were guilty of the crime against the peace as definedin the IMT Charter, this argument is conclusive, but these defendantsare not charged with crimes against the peace nor has it been provenhere that they knew that the war which they were supporting on thehome front was based upon a criminal conspiracy or was _per se_a violation of international law. The lying propaganda of Hitler andGoebbels concealed even from many public officials the criminal plansof the inner circle of aggressors. If we should adopt the view thatby reason of the fact that the war was a criminal war of aggressionevery act which would have been legal in a defensive war was illegalin this one, we would be forced to the conclusion that every soldierwho marched under orders into occupied territory or who fought in thehomeland was a criminal and a murderer. The rules of land warfareupon which the prosecution has relied would not be the measure ofconduct and the pronouncement of guilt in any case would become a mereformality. In the opinion of the Tribunal the territory occupied andannexed by Germany after September 1939 never became a part of Germany,but for that conclusion we need not rest upon the doctrine that theinvasion was a crime against the peace. Such purported annexations inthe course of hostilities while armies are in the field are provisionalonly, and dependent upon the final successful outcome of the war. Ifthe war succeeds, no one questions the validity of the annexation.If it fails, the attempt to annex becomes abortive. In view of ourclear duty to move with caution in the recently charted field ofinternational affairs, we conclude that the domestic laws and judgmentsin Germany which limited free speech in the emergency of war cannot becondemned as crimes against humanity merely by invoking the doctrineof aggressive war. All of the laws to which we have referred could beand were applied in a discriminatory manner and in the case of many,the Ministry of Justice and the courts enforced them by arbitrary andbrutal means, shocking to the conscience of mankind and punishablehere. We merely hold that under the particular facts of this case wecannot convict any defendant merely because of the fact, without more,that laws of the first four types were passed or enforced.A different situation is presented when we consider the cases whichfall within types 5, 6, and 7.                      _TREASON AND HIGH TREASON_We have expressed the opinion that the purported annexation ofterritory in the East which occurred in the course of war and whileopposing armies were still in the field was invalid and that in pointof law such territory never became a part of the Reich, but merelyremained in German military control under belligerent occupancy. On 27October 1939 the Polish Ambassador at Washington informed the Secretaryof State that the German Reich had decreed the annexation of part ofthe territory of the Polish republic. In acknowledging the receiptof this information, Secretary Hull stated that he had taken noteof the Polish governments declaration that it considers this act asillegal and therefore null and void.[646] The foregoing fact alonedemonstrates that the Polish Government was still in existence and wasrecognized by the Government of the United States. Sir Arnold D. McNairexpressed a principle which we believe to be incontestable in thefollowing words:   A purported incorporation of occupied territory by a military   occupant into his own kingdom during the war is illegal and   ought not to receive any recognition. * * *[647]We recognize that in territory under belligerent occupation themilitary authorities of the occupant may, under the laws and customsof war, punish local residents who engage in fifth column activitieshostile to the occupant. It must be conceded that the right to punishsuch activities depends upon the specific acts charged and not upon thename by which these acts are described. It must also be conceded thatPoles who voluntarily entered the Alt [old] Reich could, under the lawsof war, be punished for the violation of nondiscriminatory German penalstatutes.These considerations, however, do not justify the action of the Reichprosecutors who in numerous cases charged Poles with high treasonunder the following circumstances: Poles were charged with attemptingto escape from the Reich. The indictments in these cases alleged thatthe defendants were guilty of attempting, by violence or threat ofviolence, to detach from the Reich territory belonging to the Reich,contrary to the express provisions of section 80 of the law of 24 April1934. The territory which defendants were charged with attemptingto detach from the Reich consisted of portions of Poland, which theReich had illegally attempted to annex. If the theory of the Germanprosecutors in these cases were carried to its logical conclusion itwould mean that every Polish soldier from the occupied territoriesfighting for the restoration to Poland of territory belonging to itwould be guilty of high treason against the Reich and on capture, couldbe shot. The theory of the Reich prosecutors carries with it its ownrefutation.Prosecution in these cases represented an unwarrantable extension ofthe concept of high treason, which constituted in our opinion a warcrime and a crime against humanity. The wrong done in such prosecutionswas not merely in misnaming the offense of attempting to escape fromthe Reich; the wrong was in falsely naming the act high treason andthereby invoking the death penalty for a minor offense._MEMBERSHIP IN CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS_C. C. Law 10, article II, paragraph 1(_d_), provides:   1. Each of the following acts is recognized as a crime:          *       *       *       *       *       *       *   (_d_) Membership in categories of a criminal group or   organization declared criminal by the International Military   Tribunal.Article 9 of the IMT Charter provides:   At the trial of any individual member of any group or   organization the Tribunal may declare (in connection with any   act of which the individual may be convicted) that the group or   organization of which the individual was a member was a criminal   organization.Article 10 of the IMT Charter is as follows:   In cases where a group or organization is declared criminal   by the Tribunal, the competent national authority of any   Signatory shall have the right to bring individuals to trial   for membership therein before national, military or occupation   courts. In any such case the criminal nature of the group or   organization is considered proved and shall not be questioned.Concerning the effect of the last quoted section, we quote from theopinion of the IMT in the case of United States, et al., _vs._Goering, et al., as follows:   Article 10 of the Charter makes clear that the declaration of   criminality against an accused organization is final and cannot   be challenged in any subsequent criminal proceeding against a   member of the organization.[648]We quote further from the opinion in that case:   In effect, therefore, a member of an organization which the   Tribunal has declared to be criminal may be subsequently   convicted of the crime of membership and be punished for that   crime by death. This is not to assume that international or   military courts which will try these individuals will not   exercise appropriate standards of justice. This is a far   reaching and novel procedure. Its application, unless properly   safeguarded, may produce great injustice.          *       *       *       *       *   A criminal organization is analogous to a criminal conspiracy   in that the essence of both is cooperation for criminal   purposes. There must be a group bound together and organized for   a common purpose. The group must be formed or used in connection   with the commission of crimes denounced by the Charter. Since   the declaration with respect to the organizations and groups   will, as has been pointed out, fix the criminality of its   members, that definition should exclude persons who had no   knowledge of the criminal purposes or acts of the organization   and those who were drafted by the state for membership, unless   they were personally implicated in the commission of acts   declared criminal by article 6 of the Charter as members of the   organization. Membership alone is not enough to come within the   scope of these declarations.[649]The Tribunal in that case recommended uniformity of treatment so far aspracticable in the administration of this law, recognizing, however,that discretion in sentencing is vested in the courts. Certain groupsof the Leadership Corps, the SS, the Gestapo, the SD, were declared tobe criminal organizations by the judgment of the first InternationalMilitary Tribunal. The test to be applied in determining the guilt ofindividual members of a criminal organization is repeatedly stated inthe opinion of the First International Military Tribunal. The test isas follows: Those members of an organization which has been declaredcriminal who became or remained members of the organization withknowledge that it was being used for the commission of acts declaredcriminal by article 6 of the Charter, or who were personally implicatedas members of the organization in the commission of such crimes aredeclared punishable.Certain categories of the Leadership Corps are defined in the FirstInternational Military Tribunal judgment as criminal organizations. Wequote:   The Gauleiter, the Kreisleiter, and the Ortsgruppenleiter   participated, to one degree or another, in these criminal   programs. The Reichsleitung as the staff organization of the   Party is also responsible for these criminal programs as well as   the heads of the various staff organizations of the Gauleiter   and Kreisleiter. The decision of the Tribunal on these staff   organizations includes only the Amtsleiter who were heads of   offices on the staffs of the Reichsleitung, Gauleitung, and   Kreisleitung. With respect to other staff officers and Party   organizations attached to the Leadership Corps other than   the Amtsleiter referred to above, the Tribunal will follow   the suggestion of the prosecution in excluding them from the   declaration.[650]In like manner certain categories of the SD were defined as criminalorganizations. Again, we quote:   In dealing with the SD the Tribunal includes Aemter III, VI,   and VII of the RSHA, and all other members of the SD, including   all local representatives and agents, honorary or otherwise,   whether they were technically members of the SS or not, but not   including honorary informers who were not members of the SS and   members of the Abwehr who were transferred to the SD.[651]In like manner certain categories of the SS were declared to constitutecriminal organizations:   In dealing with the SS the Tribunal includes all persons who   had been officially accepted as members of the SS including the   members of the Allgemeine SS, members of the Waffen SS, members   of the SS Totenkopf-Verbaende, and the members of any of the   different police forces who were members of the SS. The Tribunal   does not include the so-called SS riding units.[652]C. C. Law 10 provides that we are bound by the findings as to thecriminal nature of these groups or organizations. However, it should beadded that the criminality of these groups and organizations is alsoestablished by the evidence which has been received in the pendingcase. Certain of the defendants are charged in the indictment withmembership in the following groups or organizations which have beendeclared and are now found to be criminal, to wit: The LeadershipCorps, the SD, and the SS. In passing upon these charges against therespective defendants, the Tribunal will apply the tests of criminalityset forth above._CRIMES UNDER THE NIGHT AND FOG DECREE_[_NACHT UND NEBEL ERLASS_]Paragraph 13 of count two of the indictment charges in substance thatthe Ministry of Justice participated with the OKW and the Gestapo inthe execution of the Hitler decree of Night and Fog whereby civiliansof occupied countries accused of alleged crimes in resistanceactivities against German occupying forces were spirited away forsecret trial by special courts of the Ministry of Justice within theReich; that the victims whereabouts, trial, and subsequent dispositionwere kept completely secret, thus serving the dual purpose ofterrorizing the victims relatives and associates and barring recourseto evidence, witnesses, or counsel for defense. If the accused wasacquitted, or if convicted, after serving his sentence, he was handedover to the Gestapo for protective custody for the duration of thewar. These proceedings resulted in the torture, ill treatment, andmurder of thousands of persons. These crimes and offenses are allegedto be war crimes in violation of certain established internationalrules and customs of warfare and as recognized in C. C. Law 10.Paragraph 25 of count three of the indictment incorporates by referenceparagraph 13 of count two of the indictment and alleges that the sameacts, offenses, and crimes are crimes against humanity as defined by C.C. Law 10. The same facts were introduced to prove both the war crimesand crimes against humanity and the evidence will be so considered byus.Paragraph 13 of count two of the indictment which particularlydescribes the Hitler NN plan or scheme, charges the defendantsAltstoetter, von Ammon, Engert, Joel, Klemm, Mettgenberg, andSchlegelberger with special responsibility for and participation inthese crimes, which are alleged to be war crimes.Paragraph 8 of count two of the indictment charges all of thedefendants with having committed the war crimes set forth in paragraphs9 to 18 inclusive of count two, in that they were principals in,accessories to, ordered, abetted, took a consenting part in, and wereconnected with plans and enterprises involving the commission ofatrocities and offenses against persons, including but not limited tomurder, illegal imprisonment, brutalities, atrocities, transportationof civilians, and other inhumane acts which were set out in paragraphs9 to 18 inclusive of the indictment as war crimes against the civilianpopulation in occupied territories.Paragraph 20 of count three of the indictment charges all of thedefendants with having committed the same acts as contained inparagraph 8 of count two as being crimes against humanity. Paragraphs21 to 30 inclusive of count three refer to and adopt the facts allegedin paragraphs 9 to 18 inclusive of count two, and thus all defendantsare charged with having committed crimes against humanity upon the sameallegations of facts as are contained in paragraphs 9 to 18 inclusiveof count two.In the foregoing manner all of the defendants are charged with havingparticipated in the execution or carrying out of the Hitler NN decreeand procedure either as war crimes or as crimes against humanity, andall defendants are charged with having committed numerous other actswhich constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity against thecivilian population of occupied countries during the war period between1 September 1939 and April 1945.The Night and Fog decree arose as the plan or scheme of Hitler tocombat so-called resistance movements in occupied territories. Itsenforcement brought about a systematic rule of violence, brutality,outrage, and terror against the civilian populations of territoriesoverrun and occupied by the Nazi armed forces. The IMT treated thecrimes committed under the Night and Fog decree as war crimes and foundas follows:   The territories occupied by Germany were administered in   violation of the laws of war. The evidence is quite overwhelming   of a systematic rule of violence, brutality, and terror. On 7   December 1941 Hitler issued the directive since known as the   Nacht und Nebel Erlass (Night and Fog decree), under which   persons who committed offenses against the Reich or the German   forces in occupied territories, except where the death sentence   was certain, were to be taken secretly to Germany and handed   over to the SIPO and SD for trial and punishment in Germany.   This decree was signed by the defendant Keitel. After these   civilians arrived in Germany, no word of them was permitted to   reach the country from which they came, or their relatives; even   in cases when they died awaiting trial the families were not   informed, the purpose being to create anxiety in the minds of   the families of the arrested person. Hitlers purpose in issuing   this decree was stated by the defendant Keitel in a covering   letter, dated 12 December 1941, to be as follows:   Efficient and enduring intimidation can only be achieved   either by capital punishment or by measures by which the   relatives of the criminal and the population do not know the   fate of the criminal. This aim is achieved when the criminal is   transferred to Germany.          *       *       *       *       *       *       *   The brutal suppression of all opposition to the German   occupation was not confined to severe measures against suspected   members of resistance movements themselves, but was also   extended to their families.[653]The Tribunal also found that:   One of the most notorious means of terrorizing the people   in occupied territories was the use of the concentration   camps.[654]Reference is here made to the detailed description by the IMT judgmentof the manner of operation of concentration camps and to the appallingcruelties and horrors found to have been committed therein. Suchconcentration camps were used extensively for the NN prisoners in theexecution of the Night and Fog decree as will be later shown.The IMT further found that the manner of arrest and imprisonment ofNight and Fog prisoners before they were transferred to Germany wasillegal, as follows:   The local units of the Security Police and SD continued their   work in the occupied territories after they had ceased to be   an area of operations. The Security Police and SD engaged in   widespread arrests of the civilian population of these occupied   countries, imprisoned many of them under inhumane conditions,   and subjected them to brutal third degree methods, and sent many   of them to concentration camps. Local units of the Security   Police and SD were also involved in the shooting of hostages,   the imprisonment of relatives, the execution of persons charged   as terrorists and saboteurs without a trial, and the enforcement   of the Nacht und Nebel decree under which persons charged with   a type of offenses believed to endanger the security of the   occupying forces were either executed within a week or secretly   removed to Germany without being permitted to communicate with   their family and friends.[655]The foregoing quotations from the IMT judgment will suffice to show theillegality and cruelty of the entire NN plan or scheme. The transfer ofNN prisoners to Germany and the enforcement of the plan or scheme didnot cleanse it of its iniquity or render it legal in any respect.The evidence herein adduced sustains the foregoing findings andconclusions of the IMT. In fact the same documents, or copies thereof,referred to and quoted from in the IMT judgment were introducedin evidence in this case. In addition, a large number of captureddocuments and oral testimony were introduced showing the origin andpurpose of the Night and Fog plan or scheme, and showing withoutdispute that certain of the defendants with full knowledge of theillegality of the plan or scheme under international law of war andwith full knowledge of the intended terrorism, cruelty, and otherinhumane principles of the plan or scheme became either a principal, oraided and abetted, or took a consenting part in, or were connected withthe execution of the illegal, cruel, and inhumane plan or scheme.Hitlers decree was signed by Keitel on 7 December 1941 and wasenclosed in Keitels covering letter of 12 December 1941, which wasreferred to and quoted from in the IMT judgment. The Hitler decreestates that since the opening of the Russian campaign Communist andanti-German elements have increased their assaults against the Reichand the occupation power in the occupied territories and that the mostsevere measures should be directed against these malefactors tointimidate them. The decree further declares in substance (_1733-PS,Pros. Ex. 303_):   1. Criminal acts committed by non-German civilians directed   against the Reich or occupation forces endangering their safety   or striking power should require the application of the death   penalty in principle.   2. Such criminal acts will be tried in occupied territories   only when it appears probable that the death sentence will be   passed and carried out without delay. Otherwise the offenders   will be carried to Germany.   3. Offenders taken to Germany are subject to court martial   procedures there only in case that particular military concern   should require it. German and foreign agencies will declare upon   inquiries of such offenders that the state of the proceedings   would not allow further information.   4. Commanders in chief in occupied territories and the   justiciaries within their jurisdiction will be held personally   responsible for the execution of this decree.   5. The chief of the OKW will decide in which of the occupied   territories this decree will be applied. He is authorized to   furnish explanations and further information and to issue   directives for its execution.In addition to the Hitler decree there were also enclosed in Keitelsletter of 12 December 1941 the First Decree of directives concerningthe prosecution of crimes against the Reich or occupation power inoccupied territories under the Hitler decree. This first Decree wassigned by Keitel and was marked Secret. It contains seven sectionsrelating to the crimes intended to be prosecuted under the Hitlerdecree and the manner and place of trials and execution of sentences.Section I of the first decree declares that the directive will be as arule applicable in cases of: (_671-PS, Pros. Ex. 304._)1. Assault with intent to kill.2. Espionage.3. Sabotage.4. Communist activity.5. Crimes likely to disturb the peace.6. Favoritism toward the enemy, the following means: Smuggling of menand women; the attempt to enlist in an enemy army; and the support ofmembers of the enemy army (parachutists, etc.).7. Illegal possession of arms.Section II of the secret decree declares that the culprits are not tobe tried in occupied territories unless it is probable that a deathsentence will be pronounced, and it must be possible to carry out theexecution of the death sentence at once; in general, a week after thecapture of the culprit. It further states:   Special political scruples against the immediate execution of   the death sentence should not exist.Section III of the first directive declares that the judge in agreementwith the intelligence office of the Wehrmacht decides whether thecondition for a trial in occupied territories exists.Section IV declares that the culprits who are to be taken to Germanywill be subjected there to military court proceedings if the OKW or thesuperior commanding officer declares decisions according to section III(above) that special military reasons require the military proceedings.In such instances the culprits are to be designated prisoners of theWehrmacht to the Secret Field Police. If such declaration is not made,the order that the culprit is to be taken to Germany will be treated astransferring according to the intentions of the decree.Section V declares that the judicial proceedings in Germany will becarried out under strictest exclusion of the public because of thedanger for the States security. Foreign witnesses may be questioned atthe main proceedings only with the permission of the Wehrmacht.Section VI of the first decree declares that former decrees concerningthe situation in Norway and concerning Communists and rebel movementsin the occupied territories are superseded by these directives andexecutive order.Section VII of the secret decree declares that the directives willbecome effective 3 weeks after they are signed and that the directiveswill be applied in all occupied territories with the exception ofDenmark until further notice. The orders issued for the newly occupiedEastern territories are not affected by these directives. The order wasexpressly made effective in Norway, Holland, France, Bohemia, Moravia,and the Ukraine occupied areas. In actual operation, Belgium and allother of the western occupied countries came within the decree.The Hitler decree was sent to the Reich Minister of Justice on 12December 1941 endorsed for the attention of defendant Schlegelberger.On the same day (12 December 1941) Keitel informed other ministries ofHitlers decree, directing that all such information proceedings wereto be conducted in absolute secrecy.On 16 December 1941, officials of the Ministry of Justice (Schaefer andGrau, associates of defendant Mettgenberg in Department III) drafteda proposed order for the execution of the Hitler NN decree by theMinistry of Justice, the courts, and the Reich prosecution. This wasforwarded to General Lehmann, head of the OKW legal department for hisapproval.Other correspondence took place between the Reich Ministry of Justiceand the OKW relating to the final draft of the Night and Fog order.This correspondence occurred between 16 December and 25 December 1941.It related to the reservation of the competency of the Ministry ofJustice or Under Secretary of State Freisler in the execution of theHitler decree. These reservations were incorporated in a circulardecree dated 6 February 1942, supplementing NN regulations as follows(_NG-232, Pros. Ex. 308_):                           Circular Decree:   On the execution of the executive decree of 6 February 1942,   relating to the directives issued by the Fuehrer and Supreme   Commander of the Wehrmacht for the prosecution of criminal   acts against the Reich or the occupation power in the occupied   territories.   For the further execution of the directives mentioned before I   ordain:   1. Competent for the handling of the cases transferred to   ordinary courts including their eventual retrial are: the   Special Court and the chief prosecutor in Cologne as far as they   originate from the occupied Belgian and Netherlands territories,   the Special Court and the chief prosecutor in Dortmund; as far   as they originate from the occupied Norwegian territories, the   Special Court and the chief prosecutor in Kiel; for the rest,   the Special Court and the attorney general at the county court,   Berlin. In special cases I reserve for myself the decision of   competence for each individual case.   2. The chief prosecutor will inform me of the indictment, the   intended plea, and the sentence as well as of his intention to   refrain from any accusation in a specific case.   3. The choice of a defense counsel will require the agreement   of the presiding judge who makes his decision only with the   consent of the prosecutor. The agreement may be withdrawn.   4. Warrants of arrests will be suspended only with my   consent. If such is intended, the prosecutor will report to me   beforehand. He will furthermore ask for my decision before using   foreign evidence or before agreeing to its being used by the   tribunal.   5. Inquiries concerning the accused person or the pending trial   from other sources than those Wehrmacht and police agencies   dealing with the case will be answered by merely stating that   * * * is arrested and the state of the trial does not allow   further information.This supplementary decree was signed for Dr. Freisler by chiefsecretary of the ministerial office.The letter of the same Dr. Freisler to Minister of Justice Thierackdated 14 October 1942, shows that in accordance with his promiseto Thierack he had conducted preliminary proceedings through Reichdepartmental officials and with Lehmann, Chief of the Legal Divisionof the OKW, concerning the matter of the Ministry of Justice takingover the Night and Fog proceedings under the Hitler decree. Such topsecret negotiations had lasted for several months. The last conferencewas held on 7 February 1942. On that day the final decree wasdrafted, approved, and was the decree of 7 February 1942, signed bySchlegelberger as Acting Minister of Justice. Defendant Schlegelbergertestified that he signed the decree. He thereby brought about theenforcement by the Ministry of Justice, the courts, and the prosecutorsof a systematic rule of violence, brutality, outrage, and terroragainst the civilian population of territories overrun by the Naziarmed forces resulting in the ill-treatment, death, or imprisonment ofthousands of civilians of occupied territories.The taking over of the enforcement of the Hitler NN decree was basedsolely upon the afore-mentioned secret agreement, plan, or scheme. Allof the defendants who entered into the plan or scheme, or who took partin enforcing or carrying it out knew that its enforcement violatedinternational law of war. They also knew, which was evident from thelanguage of the decree, that it was a hard, cruel, and inhumane planor scheme and was intended to serve as a terroristic measure in aid ofthe military operations and the waging of war by the Nazi regime. Wewill at this point let some of those who originated the plan or schemeor who took part in its execution relate its history and its illegal,cruel, and inhumane purposes.Rudolf Lehmann, who was Chief of the Legal Division of the OKW,testified concerning the Nacht und Nebel Decree of 7 December 1941. Hestated that even before the beginning of the war and more particularlyafter the beginning of the war, there was a controversy between Hitlerand his generals on the one part and between Hitler and the Gestapo onthe other part as to the part which should be performed by the militarydepartment of justice. He testified:   Hitler held it against the administration of justice by the   armed forces and within the armed forces that they did not   sufficiently support his manner of conducting the war.He further testified that Hitler had--   Used the expression that the military justice indeed sabotaged   his conduct of war. These reproaches first emanated from the   Polish campaign. There the military justice--the justice   administration of the armed forces--was reprimanded that it had   not acted sufficiently severe against members of bands. The next   reprimands of that kind occurred during the French campaign.Lehmann further testified that Keitel had passed on to him a directivewhich he had received from Hitler in October of 1941. This directivewas quite long in which Hitler referred to the resistance movement inFrance, which he stated was a tremendous danger for the German troopsand that new means would have to be found to combat this danger.There was therefore a discussion of the resistance movement. The armywas opposed to the plan because it involved them in violations ofinternational law of war. It was then suggested in the discussion thatthe Gestapo should be given that power. But even in this Hitlers ideaswere overruled. It was at this point that he, Lehmann, suggested thatthe matters--   Should continue to be dealt with by judges, and since the   aversion of Hitler against the armed forces justice was known,   it could be assumed that he would still prefer civilian courts   than us.Lehmann further testified that Hitler--   Attributed a higher political reliability to civilian justice   later because later he took all political criminal cases away   from us and gave it to civilian justice.At this point Lehmann discussed the matter with Under SecretaryFreisler because Freisler dealt with the criminal cases in theMinistry. He was told by Freisler that the matter would have to betaken up with Schlegelberger. Lehmann further testified:   I discussed with him the proposition that the cases which   the military courts in France would not keep should be taken   over and dealt with by and tried by the civilian justice   administration. I can only say that Freisler told me that first   he had to think it over; and secondly, he had to discuss it with   Under Secretary Schlegelberger who was at that time in charge of   the Ministry. * * * Freisler told me that he had to ask the man   who was in charge of the Ministry, the acting minister * * * for   permission and authority on behalf of the Ministry of Justice   to try the Nacht und Nebel cases. * * * As I was informed about   the routine in the Ministry, Schlegelberger, who was then acting   Minister of Justice, was in my opinion the only person who could   consent to take over these Nacht und Nebel cases by the Ministry   of Justice.Lehmann further testified:   I have stated that * * * the plan had to be rejected for   manifold reasons--for reasons of international law, for reasons   of justice, and policy of justice, and primarily, because I   said the administration of justice should never do anything   secretly. I put to him, What kind of suspicion would have to   arise against our administration of justice if these people,   inhabitants of other countries, brought to Germany, would   disappear without a trace? In my mind, and in the minds of all   others concerned, everything revolted against this particular   part of the plan, which seemed to us to have much more grave   consequence than the question of who should, in the end, deal   with it. That was also the opinion of the leading jurists of the   armed forces * * *.Defendant Mettgenberg held the position of Ministerialdirigent inDepartments III and IV of the Reich Ministry of Justice. In DepartmentIII, for penal legislation, he dealt with international law,formulating secret, general, and circular directives. He handled Nightand Fog cases and knew the purpose and procedure used in such cases,and that the decree was based upon the Fuehrers order of 7 December1941 to the OKW. In his affidavit Mettgenberg states (_NG-696, Pros.Ex. 336_):   The Night and Fog section within my subdivision, was headed   by Ministerial Counsellor von Ammon. This matter was added to   my subdivision because of its international character. I know,   of course, that a Fuehrer decree to the OKW was the basis for   this Night and Fog procedure and that an agreement had been   reached between the OKW and the Gestapo, that the OKW had also   established relations with the Minister of Justice and that the   handling of this matter was regulated accordingly.   I was not present at the original discussion with Freisler,   in which the Night and Fog matters were first discussed on   the basis of the Fuehrer decree. If I had been present at this   discussion, and if I had had an occasion to present my opinion,   I would, at any rate, have spoken against the taking over of   the Night and Fog matters by the justice administration.   It went against my training as a public servant to have the   administration of justice misused for things which were bound to   be incompatible with its basic principles.   Whenever Mr. von Ammon had doubts concerning the handling of   individual cases, we talked these questions over together,   and when they had major importance, referred them to higher   officials for decision. When he had no doubts, he could decide   all matters himself. We got these cases originally from the   Wehrmacht and later from the Gestapo. The distribution of these   cases to the competent Special Courts or to the Peoples Court,   von Ammon decided independently. Von Ammon also had to review   the indictments and sentences and to obtain the ministers   decision concerning the execution of death sentences. The   question posed by the exclusion of foreign means of evidence   was a legal problem of the first order. Since it had been   prescribed from above, the Ministry of Justice had no freedom of   disposition in this matter. This is another one of the reasons   why we should not have taken over these things.Defendant von Ammon was ministerial councillor in Mettgenbergssubdivision in charge of the Night and Fog matters. The two actedtogether on doubtful matters and referred difficult questions tocompetent officials in the Reich Ministry of Justice and the PartyChancellery, since both of these offices had to give their agreementin cases of malicious attacks upon the Reich or Nazi Party, or in Nightand Fog cases, which came originally from the Wehrmacht, and later fromthe Gestapo, and jurisdiction of which were assigned to Special Courtsat several places in Germany and to the Peoples Court at Berlin bydefendant von Ammon. In his affidavit he states (_NG-486, Pros. Ex.337_):   The decree of 7 February 1942, signed by Schlegelberger,   contained, among others, the following provisions: Foreign   witnesses could be heard in these special cases only with the   approval of the public prosecutor, since it was to be avoided   that the fate of NN prisoners became known outside of Germany.   The presiding judges of the courts concerned had to notify   the public prosecutor if they intended to deviate from their   notion for a sentence. Freisler noted in this connection that   this constituted the utmost limit of what could be asked of the   courts. The special nature of this procedure made it necessary   to make such provisions.   Later, when Thierack entered the Reich Ministry of Justice, he   changed the decree in such a manner that the courts no longer   had to declare their dissenting views to the public prosecutor,   but that the acquitted NN prisoners or those who had served   their sentences had to be handed over by the court authorities   to the Gestapo for protective custody. Under Secretary of State   Schlegelberger himself was not present at the conference, but   Under State Secretary Freisler left the conference briefly in   order to secure the signature of Schlegelberger.   I must admit that, in dealing with these matters, I did not   particularly feel at ease. It was my intention to get the best   out of this thing and to emphasize humanitarian considerations   as much as possible in these hard measures. I have seen from the   first Nuernberg trials that the court has declared the Night   and Fog decree as being against international law and that   Keitel, too, declared that he had been aware of the illegal   nature of this decree. Freisler, though, represented it to us in   such a manner as to create the impression that the decree was   very hard but altogether admissible.Mettgenberg and von Ammon were sent to the Netherlands occupiedterritory because some German courts set up there were receivingNight and Fog cases in violation of the decree that they should betransferred to Germany. They held a conference at The Hague with thehighest military justice authorities and the heads of the German courtsin the Netherlands, which resulted in a report of the matter to the OKWat Berlin, which agreed with Mettgenberg and von Ammon that--   The same procedure should be used in the Netherlands as in   other occupied territories, that is, that all Night and Fog   matters should be transferred to Germany.With respect to the effectiveness and cruelty of the NN decree, thedefendant von Ammon commented thus:   The essential point of the NN procedure, in my estimation,   consisted of the fact that the NN prisoners disappeared from the   occupied territories and that their subsequent fate remained   unknown.The distribution of the NN cases to the several competent SpecialCourts and the Peoples Court was decided upon by defendant von Ammon.A report of 9 September 1942, signed by von Ammon, addressed todefendant Rothenberger, to be submitted to the Minister of Justice andthe defendant Mettgenberg, stated that there are pending in SpecialCourts Night and Fog cases as follows: At Kiel, nine cases with 262accused; at Essen, 180 cases with 863 accused; and at Cologne, 177cases with 331 accused. By November 1943 there were turned over atKiel, 12 cases with 442 accused; at Essen, 474 cases with 2,613accused; and at Cologne, 1,169 cases with 2,185 accused.A note dated Berlin, 26 September 1942, for the attention of defendantRothenberger, signed by defendant von Ammon, stated that by order ofthe Reich Minister the hitherto--   Exclusive jurisdiction of the Special Courts over NN cases is   to some extent to be replaced by the Peoples Court of justice.A letter dated 14 October 1942 to Minister of Justice Thierack fromFreisler, then president of the Peoples Court, states that heunderstood that a conference held on 14 October 1942 extended thejurisdiction of the Peoples Court over NN cases. Freisler states thathe conducted the preliminary proceedings with Ministerial DirectorLehmann of the OKW with regard to the Ministry of Justice taking overthe Night and Fog proceedings. He explains that the Night and Fogproceedings were top secret and no file or records were made in orderto be quite sure that under no circumstances should any informationbe obtained by the outside world with regard to the fate of the alienprisoners. He also emphasizes the fact that under no circumstancescould any other sentence than the one proposed by the public prosecutorbe passed and to make sure of this in the technical routine it wasdecided that--   1. The prosecutor should be entitled to withdraw the charges   until the pronouncement of the sentence.   2. The court was to be instructed to give the prosecutor   another chance to give his point of view, in case their view   should diverge from his.Freisler further states:   In fulfillment of my promise I deemed it necessary to inform   you of this, dear sir, as these facts were not permitted to   be recorded in the files and are probably unknown in the   department.By his supplemental directive of 28 October 1942, Thierack made noteof the fact that the jurisdiction of the Peoples Court (No. 1, 1and 2 of the additional circular directives of 14 October 1942)had been extended to NN cases. Thieracks letter, dated 25 October1942 to defendant Lautz, copy to von Ammon, established and expandedjurisdiction of the Peoples Court over NN cases.Thereafter the Peoples Court handled many Night and Fog cases,convicting the accused in secret sessions with no records whatsoevermade of any evidence adduced and no record was made of the sentencepronounced. The defendant von Ammon testified that about one-half ofthe Night and Fog prisoners tried by the Peoples Court were executed.Later NN cases were sent to German Special Courts at Breslau andKatowice, Poland, and to Silesia and other places as will be shownherein._Concentration Camps_The use of concentration camps for NN prisoners was shown by a letterdated 18 August 1942, signed by Gluecks, SS Brigadefuehrer and GeneralMajor of the SS, which contained enclosures for information andexecution by officials in charge of concentration camps, includingMauthausen, Auschwitz, Flossenbuerg, Dachau, Ravensbrueck, Buchenwald,and numerous others. The letter states that such prisoners will betransferred under the Keitel decree from the occupied countries toGermany for transfer to Special Courts. Should that for any reasonbe impossible, the accused will be put into one of the above-namedconcentration camps. Those in charge of the camps were instructed thatabsolute secrecy of such prisoners detention was to be maintainedincluding the prevention of any means of communication with the outsideworld either before or after the trial.The following is illustrative of inhumane prison conditions for NNprisoners. The affidavit of Ludwig Schirmer, warden in the prison atEbrach, confirmed by his oral testimony, states:   The Ebrach prison which was used for criminal convicts had a   capacity of 595 prisoners. In 1944, however, the prison became   overcrowded and finally held a maximum of from 1,400 to 1,600   prisoners in 1945.   This crowding had been caused by numerous NN prisoners from   France and Belgium. Among them was the French General Vaillant   who died in the prison of old age and of a heart disease. Owing   to the overcrowding of the penitentiary, it was impossible to   avoid the frequent outbreak of diseases, such as pulmonary   tuberculosis, consumption, and, of course many cases of   undernourishment. The very poor medical care was a serious   disadvantage; the doctor showed up only two or three times a   week. Sixty-two inmates died during the last months of the war.   Many of them, of course, came in already sick. During the last   months, a criminal convict was employed as physician. He was a   morphinomaniac and a man of very low character.   Although there were stocks of food at hand, the feeding of   prisoners was bad; people got only soup and turnips for weeks.   NN prisoners were crowded together, four in a single cell. From   time to time a certain number of the prisoners was transferred   to the concentration camp.The affidavit of Josef Prey, head guard at the Amberg prison,confirmed by his oral testimony, states that foreigners, Jews, and NNprisoners at Amberg prison, which had a capacity of 900 to 1,100 wereincarcerated there. Yet shortly before the collapse there were 2,000prisoners of whom 800 to 900 prisoners were Polish, and NN prisonerswho included Frenchmen, Dutchmen, and Belgians. From time to time bysecret decree prisoners were transferred to the concentration campsat Mauthausen. Defendant Engert, the official representative of thedepartment of justice, visited and officially inspected the prison andknew of these conditions.By his affidavit Engert states that Thierack told him the Night andFog prisoners had to be treated with special precaution, not allowedany correspondence, locked up hermetically from the outer world, andthat care should be taken that their real names remain unknown to thelower prison personnel. Engert further states that these orders werethe result of the Fuehrer decree of 7 December 1941 and that Thieracktold him the Night and Fog prisoners were accused of resistance andviolence against the armed forces. He did not know what became of theseNN prisoners at the various prison camps. He did know that an agreementexisted with the Gestapo that the bodies of Night and Fog prisonersshould be given to them for secret burial. It was shown by othertestimony that defendant Engert was ministerial director, who handledand investigated the Night and Fog prisoners and that he was in chargeof the task of transferring prisoners and knew their nationality andthe character of crime charged against them.On 14 June 1944 defendant von Ammon wrote Bormann, Chief of the PartyChancellery, a letter sent by way of defendant Mettgenberg, requestingpermission of the Fuehrer to inform NN women held under death sentenceof the fact that such sentence has been reprieved, since he considersit to be unnecessarily cruel to keep these condemned women insuspense for years as to whether their death sentence will be carriedout.Mrs. Solf, the widow of a former distinguished German cabinet officerand ambassador, testified that she was tried and held as a politicalprisoner of the Nazi regime for several years in Ravensbrueckconcentration camp and other prisons where a large number of foreignwomen were imprisoned. Concerning the ill-treatment of these women andthe prison conditions under which they were incarcerated, Mrs. Solftestified:   As to the prisoners who were with me at Ravensbrueck, as far   as I can remember there was only an Italian woman of Belgian   descent who was treated well, better than we were. However, in   the penitentiary of Cottbus, as well as in the prison of Moabit,   I met many foreigners. In the penitentiary of Cottbus, there   alone were 300 French women who were sentenced to death, and   five Dutch women sentenced to death who after a week or two were   pardoned to penitentiary terms and whom   I saw in the courtyard. The 300 French women sentenced to death   were sent to Ravensbrueck at the end of November 1944. The night   before they were transported they had to sleep on a bare stone   floor. One of the auxiliary wardens, who was also an interpreter   for them and who had a great deal of courage and a kind heart,   came to me in order to ask us political prisoners to give them   our blankets, which we certainly did.She further testified:   I know and have seen for myself that, for instance, in Moabit,   some of the brutal wardens kicked them and shouted at them for   reasons which seemed very, very unjust because these women did   not understand what they were supposed to do.The Night and Fog decree was from time to time implemented by severalplans or schemes, which were enforced by the defendants. One plan orscheme was the transfer of alleged resistance prisoners or personsfrom occupied territories who had served their sentences or had beenacquitted to concentration camps in Germany where they were heldincommunicado and were never heard from again. Another scheme was thetransfer of the inhabitants of occupied territories to concentrationcamps in Germany as a substitute for a court trial. Defendant Engertmade such an order.                       _Trials under NN Decree_The evidence establishes beyond a reasonable doubt that in theexecution of the Hitler NN decree the Nazi regimes Ministry ofJustice, Special Courts, and public prosecutors agreed to andacted together with the OKW and Gestapo in causing to be arrested,transported to Germany, tried, sentenced to death and executed, orimprisoned under the most cruel and inhumane conditions in prisonsand concentration camps, thousands of the civilian population of thecountries overrun and occupied by the Nazi regimes military forcesduring the prosecution of its criminal and aggressive war.The trials of the accused NN persons did not approach even a semblanceof fair trial or justice. The accused NN persons were arrested andsecretly transported to Germany and other countries for trial. Theywere held incommunicado. In many instances they were denied the rightto introduce evidence, to be confronted by witnesses against them, orto present witnesses in their own behalf. They were tried secretlyand denied the right of counsel of their own choice, and occasionallydenied the aid of any counsel. No indictment was served in manyinstances and the accused learned only a few moments before the trialof the nature of the alleged crime for which he was to be tried. Theentire proceedings from beginning to end were secret and no publicrecord was allowed to be made of them. These facts are proved bycaptured documents and evidence adduced on the trial, to some of whichwe now advert.The first trial of NN cases took place at Essen. A letter from theprosecutor, dated 20 August 1942, addressed to the Reich Minister ofJustice, was received on 27 August 1942, states that five defendantswere to be tried and that two of them were to get prison terms andthat--   In the remaining cases the death sentence is to be ordered   and inquiries made whether they should be executed by the   guillotine.These sentences were later pronounced.In response to several inquiries from prosecutors at Special Courtsin Essen, Kiel, and Cologne citing pending NN cases, the defendantsMettgenberg and von Ammon replied that, in view of the regulation forthe keeping of NN trials absolutely secret, defense counsel chosen byNN defendants would not be permitted.In these same inquiries, it is stated that if defense counsel werecarefully selected from those who were recognized as unconditionallyreliable, pro-State and judicially efficient lawyers, no difficultyshould arise with respect to the secrecy of such proceedings. It issuggested that if an attorney should inquire concerning representationof an NN defendant, he should be informed that it is not permissible toinvestigate whether or not there was any proceeding pending against theaccused. This inquiry related to 16 NN French defendants who were tobe tried at Cologne. Other evidence introduced in the case showed thatthis practice was followed.The foreign countries department of the Wehrmacht High Command reportedto defendant von Ammon on 15 October 1942 a list of 224 alleged spiesarrested in France in the execution of what was known as Actionporto, of whom 220 had already been transported to Germany. Inquirywas made whether these prisoners should be regarded as coming underHitlers NN Decree. A later directive issued 6 March 1943, which wasinitialed by defendant Mettgenberg and sent to the SS Chief Himmler,states that orders and regulations covering NN prisoners in generalwill be applied to porto action groups. The circular decree statesfurther that in case of death of porto action prisoners, the sameprocedure is followed with respect to secrecy as is followed in NNcases, and that the estates of porto action prisoners are tobe retained by the penal institution for the time being, and thatrelatives are not to be informed about the death of such prisoners,especially not of their execution.A letter dated 9 February 1943, Berlin, to the president of thePeoples Court, chief public prosecutor at Kiel and Cologne, and ChiefPublic Prosecutor at Hamm, states that for the purpose of carrying outthe Night and Fog decree or directive (_NG-253, Pros. Ex. 317_):   In trials (before the Landesgericht), in which according to   the regulations, defense counsel has to be provided for the   defendant, the regulation may be ignored when the president of   the court can conscientiously state that the character of the   accused and the nature of the charge make the presence of a   defense counsel superfluous.In connection with the foregoing matter, a secret note to defendant vonAmmon, dated 18 January 1941, suggests that a regulation concerningcounsel for NN prisoners should be drafted. A letter dated 4 January1943 states that in accordance with the power granted under theFuehrers order of 7 December 1941 (_NG-253, Pros. Ex. 317_):   Article IV, paragraph 32 of the Competence Decree of 21   February 1940 (relating to appointment of defense counsel) is   cancelled. The president of the court will order defendant to   be represented only if he is unable to defend himself or for   any special reason it seems desirable that defendant should be   represented.A letter dated 21 April 1943, Berlin, by Thierack, Minister of Justice,states that (_NG-256, Pros. Ex. 320_):   Your ordinance of 21 December 1942 decreed that in criminal   cases concerning criminal actions against the Reich and the   occupation authority in the occupied territories, defense   counsel of ones own choice should not be approved of on   principle.A letter by Thierack to the president of the Peoples Court, Berlin,dated 13 May 1943, states that (_NG-256, Pros. Ex. 320_):   The directives given by the Fuehrer on 7 December 1941 for the   prosecution of criminal actions committed against the Reich   or the occupation authorities in the occupied territories are   applicable, according to their meaning and their tenor, to   foreigners only, and not to German nationals or provisional   Germans.A draft of an extensive secret order or directives of the ReichMinister of Justice, dated 6 March 1943, covering secret NN procedurewas sent to and initialed by or for heads of Ministry Departments IIIand IV (the defendant Mettgenberg), Department V (headed by defendantEngert), [initialed by Marx] and Department VI (headed by defendantAltstoetter). The directives instructed all so concerned to takefurther measures in order not to endanger necessary top secrecy of NNprocedure. Separate copies of this order, dated 6 March 1943, weresent to the afore-mentioned ministry departments, including DepartmentVI, headed by defendant Altstoetter, who admits having seen andexecuted the directives, to defendant von Ammon and to, among others,the chief Reich prosecutor at the Peoples Court (defendant Lautz); theattorneys general in Celle, Duesseldorf, Frankfurt on Main, Hamburg,Hamm, Kiel, and Cologne; and the attorney general at the Prussian Courtof Appeal; and for the attention of presidents of the Peoples Court,district courts of appeal at Hamm, Kiel, and Cologne, and the Prussiancourt of appeal at Berlin. Among the measures of secrecy includedin the order or directives were the following (_NG-269, Pros. Ex.319_):   The cards used for investigations for the Reich criminal   statistics need not be filled in. Likewise, notification of the   penal records office will be discontinued until further notice.   However, sentences will have to be registered in lists or on a   card index in order to make possible an entry into the penal   records in due course.   In case of death, especially in cases of execution of NN   prisoners, as well as in cases of female NN prisoners giving   birth to a child, the registrar must be notified as prescribed   by law. However, the following remark has to be added:   By order of the Reich Minister of the Interior, the entry into   the death (birth) registry must bear an endorsement, saying   that examination of the papers, furnishing of information and   of certified copies of death (birth) certificates is only   admissible with the consent of the Reich Minister of Justice.Department VI headed by defendant Altstoetter handled matters relatingto registration of deaths and births. The order further provides:   Farewell letters by NN prisoners as well as other letters must   not be mailed. They have to be forwarded to the prosecution who   will keep them until further notice.   If an NN prisoner who has been sentenced to death and informed   of the forthcoming execution of the death sentence desires   spiritual assistance by the prison padre, this will be granted.   If necessary, the padre must be sworn to secrecy.   The relatives will not be informed of the death and especially   of the execution of an NN prisoner. The press will not be   informed of the execution of a death sentence, nor must the   execution of a death sentence be publicly announced by posters.   The bodies of executed NN prisoners or prisoners who died from   other causes have to be turned over to the State Police for   burial. Reference must be made to the existing regulations on   secrecy. It must be pointed out especially that the graves of NN   prisoners must not be marked with the names of the deceased.   The bodies must not be used for teaching or research purposes.   Legacies of NN prisoners who have been executed or died from   other causes must be kept at the prison where the sentence was   served.Later, in some instances the right to spiritual assistance was deniedand a later directive authorized the turning over of bodies of NNpersons to institutes for experimental purposes.A letter dated 3 June 1943, from the Reich Ministry of Justice to thePeoples Court justices and the Chief Public Prosecutors, initialedby defendant Mettgenberg, deals with the subject of trials under theNN decree of foreigners who were nationals of other countries thanthose occupied by the Nazi forces. The difficulty obviously involved aviolation of international law as to such nationals of other countries.In particular, the difficulty arose as to the regulation for themaintenance of secrecy of such trials and whether the secrecy withregard to NN cases should apply. The reply was that they were to betried in accordance with the circular decrees of 6 February 1942 and14 October 1942, and the regulations issued for the amendment of thesecircular decrees to be entitled NN Prisoners Taken by Mistake. Thisdecree provides that if the trial of such foreigners could not becarried out separately from the trial of the nationals of the occupiedcountries for reasons pertaining to the presentation of evidence, thenthe trials were to be strictly in accordance with the provisions of NNprocedure; otherwise said foreign nationals would obtain knowledge ofthe course of the trial against their accomplices.A note signed by the defendant von Ammon, dated 7 October 1943, statesthat NN prisoners were often ignorant of charges against them until afew moments before the trial. He further states that Chief Reich PublicProsecutor Lautz asked him whether there were any objections to thetranslation of the indictment into the language of the defendant, whichwould then be handed to him. Defendant von Ammon replied that therewould be no objection to the proceeding and stated (_NG-281, Pros.Ex. 323_):   It proved rather awkward that defendants learned the details of   their charges only during the trial. Also, the interpretation   by defense counsel is not always sufficient because their French   mostly is not good enough and defendants were brought to the   place of trial only shortly before it was held.The same difficulty arose as to Czech defendants.A report on a conference with respect to new procedure in treatment ofNight and Fog cases originating in the Netherlands, signed von Ammonand Mettgenberg, 9 November 1943, addressed to Ministerial DirectorEngert and others, states that while returning from The Hague to Berlinthe undersigned representative of the Reich Ministry of Justice held on5 November as scheduled, a conference with the head officials of thecourt of appeals at Hamm and that defendant Joel thought the housing ofNN prisoners, also such of Dutch nationality, at Papenburg, would bepossible and unobjectionable. This was later carried out.A secret letter dated 29 December 1943, addressed to defendant vonAmmon from the presiding judge and chief prosecutor of Hamm Courtof Appeals notified von Ammon of an imminent conference concerningtransfer of the NN trials to the NN Special Courts at Oppeln andKatowice.A letter from Breslau dated 10 January 1944, signed by Dr. Sturm, asksthat ministerial councillor, defendant von Ammon, be available for ameeting at Breslau between 15 and 31 January 1944 to discuss routineproceedings for handling NN cases.A letter addressed to the German commander of the French occupiedzone states that effective from 15 November 1943 all cases of crimescommitted against the Reich or the occupation forces in occupied Frenchzones hitherto submitted to the ordinary legal authorities were to betaken over by the Special Court and attorney general in Cologne andBreslau.The defendant von Ammon attended conferences with public prosecutors inBreslau and Katowice (Poland) on 18 and 19 February 1944, concerninghousing of NN prisoners and possibility of transferring NN cases fromthe Netherlands, Belgium, and northern France to Special Courts inPoland for trial; von Ammon reported the results of these conferencesin detail to, among others, the defendant Klemm (under secretary)and personally wrote on his report that he had secured appropriateGauleiters concurrence to the proposed transfer. Shortly thereafterthe Ministry of Justice issued a decree endorsed to the defendantMettgenberg for signature, and submitted twice to von Ammon, forinformation and cosignature, whereby these Dutch, Belgian, andnorthern French NN cases were to be transferred to Silesia for trial.In response to this decree, von Ammon was personally notified thatthe defendant Joel (then general public prosecutor at Hamm) fearedobjections from the Wehrmacht because of the longer transportationinvolved in the transfer.A directive by the Reich Minister of Justice with respect to treatmentof NN prisoners, dated Berlin, 21 January 1944, initialed by defendantvon Ammon, to the president of the Peoples Court, to the Reich LeaderSS, Reich prosecutor of the Peoples Court (defendant Lautz), to theChief Public Prosecutor at Hamm (defendant Joel), and others, statesthat when an NN prisoner had been acquitted by a general court, ifit appears that the accused is innocent or if his guilt has not beenestablished sufficiently, then he has to be handed over to the SecretPolice. The directive further states:   If in the main trial of an NN proceeding it appears that the   accused is innocent or if his guilt has not been sufficiently   established, then he is to be handed over to the Secret State   Police; the public prosecutor informs the Secret State Police   about his opinion whether the accused can be released and return   into the occupied territories, or whether he is to be kept under   detention. The Secret State Police decide which further actions   are to be taken.   Accused who were acquitted, or whose proceedings were closed in   the main trial, or who served a sentence during the war, are to   be handed over to the Secret State Police for detention for the   duration of the war.A letter dated 21 January 1944, Berlin, to the OKW and the JudgeAdvocate General Department, dispatched 22 January 1944 (copy toDr. Mettgenberg with request for approval) complains of lack ofcoordination in NN cases between military courts and justice officials.This complaint relates primarily to transfer of NN cases.In answer to the objections to the transfer of NN cases arising inFrance from Cologne to Breslau, dated 18 January 1944, the defendantsMettgenberg and von Ammon insisted that the transfer is necessary anddirected its accomplishment. Three days later a letter endorsed byMettgenberg informed Himmler that this transfer of NN cases had takenplace.On 24 April 1944 von Ammon reported in detail on a trip he made toParis previously referred to. This official visit served particularlyto obtain information of the security situation in France and todetermine whether the NN procedures of the Breslau Special Courtwere approved by the army. This meeting occurred in the office ofthe Chief Justice of the German Military Governor of Paris, Generalvon Stuelpnagel. Von Ammon submitted this report both to Klemm andMettgenberg who initialed it.A letter from Hamm (Westphalia), 26 January 1944, to the Reich MinisterThierack, signed by defendant Joel, suggests the speeding up ofproceedings to avoid delays in NN cases, and suggests that:   The Chief Public Prosecutor submits record to the chief   Reich prosecutor only if, according to previous experience or   according to directives laid down by the chief Reich prosecutor,   it is to be expected that he will take over, or partly take over   the case.   As a rule, even now when the draft of the indictment is   submitted for approval to the Reich Minister of Justice, the   records are not enclosed. The decision rests with me, to whom   the documents are brought by courier.A note signed by Dr. Reicholt, 20 April 1944, copy to defendant vonAmmon, expresses the same difficulty experienced by defendant Joel andasks that Chief Public Prosecutor at the Peoples Court decide quicklywhich of the accused persons he wanted to keep so that they may betransferred as quickly as possible.The foregoing requests for speed in handling NN cases were due todisturbances caused by air raids. The Reich Minister of Justicereplied, 26 April 1944, that in the main the delay in the proceedingsis unavoidable.Defendant von Ammon reported on a conference with German occupyingforces of Belgium and northern France, held in Oppeln on 29 and 30 June1944. Von Ammon stated that since the Allied invasion had not causedundue tension as yet, it was unnecessary at that time to make penaltiesin NN cases more severe. This report was initialed by defendantMettgenberg.                       _Disposition of NN Cases_A statistical survey of NN cases as of 1 November 1943 made toMinisterial Director Dr. Vollmer, Berlin, 22 November 1943, shows casesand sentences passed on NN prisoners as follows:1. Turned over by the Wehrmacht authorities to senior publicprosecutors at Kiel, 12 cases with 442 defendants; at Essen, 474 caseswith 2,613 defendants; at Cologne, 1,169 cases with 2,185 defendants.2. Charges filed by senior public prosecutors as follows: At Kiel, ninecases with 175 defendants; at Essen, 254 cases with 860 defendants; atCologne, 173 cases with 257 defendants; by chief public prosecutor atthe Peoples Court (Lautz), 111 cases with 494 defendants.3. Sentences passed by Special Courts at Kiel, eight on 168 defendants;at Essen, 221 cases with 475 defendants; at Cologne, 128 cases with183 defendants; at Peoples Court, 84 cases with 304 defendants.The defendant von Ammon testified that about one-half of all defendantstried by the Peoples Court were given the death penalty and wereexecuted. The foregoing documents show that defendant Lautz was ChiefPublic Prosecutor at the Peoples Court at the time the 304 sentenceswere pronounced in the Night and Fog cases.A similar survey, 5 months later (30 April 1944), shows that of a totalof 8,639 NN defendants transferred to the various Special Courts andthe Peoples Court in Germany, 3,624 were indicted, and 1,793 weresentenced. Defendant von Ammon initialed this survey.The foregoing statistical reports as to time are obviously incomplete.They do not show the number of NN cases tried at Breslau, Katowice, andother places. The foregoing documents show that at these places greatdifficulty was experienced because of lack of prisons for the largenumber of NN prisoners who were sent to these areas. Nor do they showthe number of NN prisoners committed to concentration camps withouttrial. They do not show the number of residue NN prisoners who wereat the end of the control of NN matters by the Minister of Justicecommitted to concentration camps and never heard from thereafter.              _Use of NN Prisoners in Armament Industry_In file of reports for the years 1943 and 1944 of NN cases stillpending in the Ministry of Justice, the attorney general at Katowice(Poland) stated to the Ministry of Justice the following (_NG-264,Pros. Ex. 334_):   NN prisoners held within the jurisdiction of the Court of   Appeal of Katowice are already employed to a large extent in   the armament industry, regardless of whether they are being   held for questioning or punishment. They are quartered there in   special camps at or near the place of the respective industrial   enterprise. In this way it is intended, if possible, to place   all NN prisoners at the disposal of the armament industry.   It has been disclosed that the NN prisoners already employed   in the armament industry, as for instance the 400-odd prisoners   working in Laband, have done a very good job and excel in   particular as skilled workers. The armament industry therefore   wants to retain the employed NN prisoners also after their   acquittal or after they have served their sentence.   I ask for a decision on whether and, if so, how that demand can   be complied with. Considerable doubts arise from the fact that   there is no legal right to confine them further and that the   judicial authorities would thus take preventive police measures.   There is the question, however, whether the situation of the   Reich does not justify even such extraordinary measures.This request was handled by defendant von Ammon, who endorsed it asfollows:   Submitted * * * first to Department V (headed by defendant   Engert) with the request for an opinion. If you have no   objections I intend to contact the RSHA in accordance with the   report of the attorney general at Katowice.                      _Clemency in the NN Cases_As Under Secretary, defendant Klemm was required to pass upon clemencymatters either while acting with or in the absence of the Minister ofJustice. He admits passing upon clemency pleas in NN death cases andrefusing all of them. Fourteen documents concerning NN matters passedthrough defendant Klemm after he became under secretary of State. Heknew of the transfer of NN cases from Essen to Silesia and knew ofroutine NN matters which passed through his department.In the fall of 1944 Hitler ordered the discontinuance of the NNproceedings by the justice and the OKW courts and transferred theentire problem to the Gestapo, the NN prisoners being handed overto the Gestapo at the same time. In later conferences attended bydefendant von Ammon, the Ministry of Justice agreed to and lateractually carried out the transfer by committing them from theMinistrys prisons to the Gestapos custody. Defendant Lautz wasordered to suspend Peoples Court proceedings against NN prisoners andtransfer them to the Gestapo. The witness Hecker stated that those NNprisoners of the Berlin district, of which he had knowledge, were sentto Oranienburg.The final order of the Ministry of Justice committing all NN prisonerson hand to the Gestapo and the concentration camps was one of extremecruelty.The foregoing documents and the undisputed facts show that Hitler andthe high ranking officials of the armed forces and of the Nazi Party,including several Reich Ministers of Justice and other high officialsin the Ministry of Justice, judges of the Nazi regimes courts, thepublic prosecutors at such courts, either agreed upon, consented to,took a consenting part in, ordered, or abetted, were connected with theHitler NN plan, scheme, or enterprise involving the commission of warcrimes and crimes against humanity during the waging of the recent waragainst the Allied nations and other neighboring nations of Germany.The foregoing documents and facts show without dispute that severalof the defendants participated to one degree or another either as aprincipal; or ordered, or abetted, took a consenting part in, or wereconnected with the execution or carrying out of the Hitler NN scheme orplan. The defendants so participating will be later discussed in thesummation of the evidence.The Night and Fog decree originated with Hitler as a plan or schemeto combat alleged resistance movements against the German occupationforces but it was early extended by the Ministry of Justice to includeoffenses against the German Reich. Often the offenses had nothing todo with the security of the armed forces in the occupied territories.Many of them occurred after military operations had ceased and in areaswhere there were no military operations. The first secret decree of theMinistry of Justice for the execution or carrying out of the NN decreeprovided for:    1. The prosecution of criminal offenses against the Reich or,    2. The occupation troops in occupied areas.It declared that the directive will be as a rule applicable to theseven above listed general types of offenses or crimes, includingCommunist activity. The term Communist activity is general andpolitical in nature. The evidence shows that political prisoners inoccupied territories were tried and sentenced to death under the NNproceedings. Pertinent here with respect to the so-called resistanceactivities is the finding of the IMT that:   The local units of the Security Police and SD continued their   work in the occupied territories after they had ceased to be   an area of operations. The Security Police and SD engaged in   widespread arrests of the civilian population of these occupied   countries, imprisoned many of them under inhumane conditions,   subjected them to brutal third degree methods, and sent many of   them to concentration camps. Local units of the Security Police   and SD were also involved in the shooting of hostages, the   imprisonment of relatives, the execution of persons charged as   terrorists, [and saboteurs without a trial], and the enforcement   of the Nacht und Nebel decrees under which persons charged   with a type of offense believed to endanger the security of the   occupying forces were either executed within a week or secretly   removed to Germany without being permitted to communicate with   their family and friends.[656]Defendant Schlegelberger explained the fundamental purpose of the NNdecree to be a deterrent through cutting off of the prisoners fromevery contact with the outside world. He further explained that theNN prisoners were expected and were to be tried materially accordingto the same regulations which would have been applied to them by thecourts martial in the occupied territories and that accordingly, therules of procedure had been curtailed to the utmost extent.The enforcement of the directives under the Hitler NN plan orscheme became a means of instrumentality by which the most completecontrol and coercion of a lot of the people of occupied territorieswere affected and under which thousands of the civilian populationof occupied areas were imprisoned, terrorized, and murdered. Theenforcement and administration of the NN directives resulted in thecommission of war crimes and crimes against humanity in violation ofthe international law of war and international common law relating torecognized human rights, and of article II, paragraphs 1(_b_) and(_c_) of Control Council Law No. 10.During the war, in addition to deporting millions of inhabitants ofoccupied territories for slave labor and other purposes, Hitlers Nightand Fog program was instituted for the deportation to Germany of manythousands of inhabitants of occupied territories for the purpose ofmaking them disappear without trace and so that their subsequent fateremain secret. This practice created an atmosphere of constant fearand anxiety among their relatives, friends, and the population of theoccupied territories.The report of the Paris Conference of 1919, referred to above, listed32 crimes as constituting the most striking list of crimes as has everbeen drawn up, to the eternal shame of those who committed them. Thislist of crimes was considered and recognized by the Versailles Treatyand was later recognized as international law in the manner hereinabove indicated. Among the crimes so listed was the deportation ofcivilians from enemy occupied territories.Control Council Law No. 10 in illustrating acts constituting violationsof laws or customs of war, recognizes as war crimes the deportationto slave labour or for any other purpose of civilian population fromoccupied territory. (Art. II, 1(_b_).) C. C. Law 10 [Article II]paragraph 1(_c_) also recognizes as crimes against humanity theenslavement, deportation, imprisonment * * * against any civilianpopulation.The IMT held that the deportation of inhabitants from occupiedterritories for the purpose of efficient and enduring intimidationconstituted a violation of the laws and customs of war. The deportationfor the purpose of efficient and enduring intimidation is likewisecondemned by C. C. Law 10, under the provision inhibiting deportation* * * for any other purpose, of civilian population from occupiedterritory.Also among the list of 32 crimes contained in the Conference Report of1919 are murder and massacre, and systematic terrorism. C. C. Law10 makes deportation of civilian population for any purpose a crimerecognized as coming within the jurisdiction of the law. The admittedpurpose of the Night and Fog decree was to provide an efficient andenduring intimidation of the population of occupied territories. TheIMT held that the Hitler NN decree was a systematic rule of violence,brutality, and terror, and was therefore in violation of the laws ofwar as a terroristic measure.The evidence shows that many of the Night and Fog prisoners who weredeported to Germany were not charged with serious offenses and weregiven comparatively light sentences or acquitted. This shows that theywere not a menace to the occupying forces and were not dangerous in theeyes of the German justices who tried them. But they were kept secretlyand not permitted to communicate in any manner with their friends andrelatives. This is inhumane treatment. It was meted out not only to theprisoners themselves but to their friends and relatives back home whowere in constant distress of mind as to their whereabouts and fate.The families were deprived of the support of the husband, thus causingsuffering and hunger. The purpose of the spiriting away of personsunder the Night and Fog decree was to deliberately create constant fearand anxiety among the families, friends, and relatives as to the fateof the deportees. Thus, cruel punishment was meted out to the familiesand friends without any charge or claim that they actually did anythingin violation of any occupation rule of the army or of any crime againstthe Reich.It is clear that mental cruelty may be inflicted as well as physicalcruelty. Such was the express purpose of the NN decree, and thousandsof innocent persons were so penalized by its enforcement.The foregoing documents show without dispute that the NN victim washeld incommunicado and the rest of the population only knew that arelative or citizen had disappeared in the night and fog; hence,the name of the decree. If relatives or friends inquired, they weregiven no information. If diplomats or lawyers inquired concerning thefate of an NN prisoner, they were told that the state of the recorddid not admit of any further inquiry or information. The population,relatives, or friends were not informed for what character of offensethe victim had been arrested. Thus, they had no guide or standard bywhich to avoid committing the same offense as the unfortunate victimshad committed which necessarily created in their minds terror and dreadthat a like fate awaited them.Throughout the whole Night and Fog program ran this element of uttersecrecy. This secrecy of the proceedings was a particularly obnoxiousform of terroristic measure and was without parallel in the annals ofhistory. It could have been promulgated only by the cruel Nazi regimewhich sought to control and terrorize the civilian population of thecountries overrun by its aggressive war. There was no proof that thedeportation of the civilian population from the occupied territorieswas necessary to protect the security of the occupant forces. TheNN plan or scheme fit perfectly into the larger plan or scheme oftransportation of millions of persons from occupied territories toGermany.C. C. Law 10 makes deportation of the civilian population for anypurpose an offense. The international law of war has for a long periodof time protected the civilian population of any territory or countryoccupied by an enemy war force. This law finds its source in theunwritten international law as established by the customs and usagesof the civilized nations of the world. Under international law theinhabitants of an occupied area or territory are entitled to certainrights which must be respected by the invader occupant.This law of military occupation has been in existence for a long periodof time. It was officially interpreted and applied nearly a halfcentury ago by the President of the United States of America duringthe war with Spain in 1898. By General Order No. 101, 18 July 1898(U. S. Foreign Relations, p. 783), the President declared that theinhabitants of the occupied territory are entitled to the securityin their persons and property and in all their private rights andrelations. He further declared that it was the duty of the commanderof the Army of Occupation to protect them in their homes, in theiremployments, and in their personal and religious rights, and thatthe municipal laws of the conquered territory, such as affect privaterights of persons and property and provide for punishment of crime,are continued in force and are to be administered by the ordinarytribunals, substantially as they were before the occupation. ThePresident referred to the fact that these humane standards of warfarehad previously been established by the laws and customs of war, whichwere later codified by the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907, andwhich constituted the effort of the civilized participating nationsto diminish the evils of war by the limitation of the power of theinvading occupant over the people and by placing the inhabitants ofthe occupied area or territory under the protection and the rule ofthe principles of the law of nations, as they result from the usagesestablished among civilized peoples, from the laws of humanity and thedictates of the public conscience.A similar order was issued during the first war with Germany bythe President of the United States of America when the AmericanExpeditionary Forces entered the Rhineland in November 1918. (GeneralOrder No. 218, 28 November 1918.) At the conclusion of this occupancy,the German Government expressed its appreciation of the conduct of theAmerican occupying forces.But Germany soon forgot these humane standards of warfare, as is shownby the undisputed evidence. The general policy of the Nazi regimewas to terrorize and in some instances to exterminate the civilianpopulations of occupied territories.Pertinent here is the finding of the IMT that:   In an order issued by the defendant Keitel on 23 July 1941, and   drafted by the defendant Jodl, it was stated that:   In view of the vast size of the occupied areas in the East,   the forces available for establishing security in these areas   will be sufficient only if all resistance is punished, not   by legal prosecution of the guilty, but by the spreading of   such terror by the armed forces as is alone appropriate to   eradicate every inclination to resist among the population * *   *. Commanders must find the means of keeping order by applying   suitable Draconian measures.[657]Both Keitel and Jodl were sentenced to death by the IMT and laterexecuted. It was the same Keitel who had issued, over his ownsignature, the Hitler NN decree which provided that (_NG 669-PS,Pros. Ex. 305_):   Efficient and enduring intimidation can only be achieved either   by capital punishment or by measures by which the relatives of   the criminal and the population do not know the fate of the   criminal. This aim is achieved when the criminal is transferred   to Germany.Beyond dispute the foregoing decrees were inspired by the same thoughtand purpose and represent the general policy of the Nazi regime inthe prosecution of its aggressive war. This general policy was toterrorize, torture, and in some occupied areas to exterminate thecivilian population. The undisputed evidence in this case shows thatGermany violated during the recent war every principle of the lawof military occupation. Not only under NN proceedings but in alloccupations she immediately, upon occupation of invaded areas andterritories, set aside the laws and courts of the occupied territories.She abolished the courts of the occupied lands and set up courts mannedby members of the Nazi totalitarian regime and system. These laws ofoccupation were cruel and extreme beyond belief and were enforced bythe Nazi courts in a cruel and ruthless manner against the inhabitantsof the occupied territories, resulting in grave outrages againsthumanity, against human rights and morality and religion, and againstinternational law, and against the law as declared by C. C. Law 10,by authority of which this Court exercises its jurisdiction in theinstant case. The evidence adduced herein provides undeniable andpositive proof of the ill-treatment of the subjugated people by theNazi Ministry of Justice and prosecutors to such an extent that juristsas well as civilians of civilized nations who respect human rightsand human personality and dignity can hardly believe that the Nazijudicial system could possibly have been so cruel and ruthless in theirtreatment of the population of occupied areas and territories.The foregoing procedure under the NN decree was clearly in violation ofthe following provisions sanctioned by the Hague Regulations:   _Article 5._--Prisoners of war * * * cannot be confined   except as an indispensable measure of safety and only while the   circumstances which necessitate the measure continue to exist.   _Article 23(h)._--* * * It is expressly forbidden * * * to   declare abolished, suspended, or inadmissible in a court of law   the rights and actions [of the nationals] of the hostile party.   _Article 43._--The authority of the legitimate power   having in fact passed into the hands of the occupant, the latter   shall take all the measures in his power to restore, and ensure,   as far as possible, public order and safety, while respecting,   unless absolutely prevented, the law in force in the country.   _Article 46._--Family honor and rights, the lives of   persons and private property, as well as religious convictions   and practice, must be respected. Private property cannot be   confiscated.Both the international rules of war and C. C. Law 10 inhibit thetorture of civilians by the occupying forces. Under the Night and Fogdecree civilians were secretly transported to concentration camps andwere imprisoned under the most inhumane conditions as was shown bythe above statements from captured documents. They were starved andill-treated while in concentration camps and prisons. Thus, the Nightand Fog decree violated these express inhibitions of international lawof war as well as the express provisions of C. C. Law 10.Such imprisonment and ill-treatment was also in violation of the ruleprescribed by the Conference of Paris of 1919 which prohibits theinternment of civilians under inhumane conditions. The Night andFog decree was in violation of the international law as recognized bythe Paris Conference of 1919 in that the NN prisoners were deported toGermany and forced to labor in the munitions plants of the enemy power.The foregoing documents establish beyond dispute that they were soemployed in munitions plants with the sanction and approval of theReich Ministry of Justice under the approval of the defendant von Ammon.The extent of activity and the criminality of the defendants whoparticipated in the execution and carrying out of the Night and Fogdecree will be discussed under the summation of the evidence relatingto each such defendant. Each defendant has pleaded in effect as adefense the act of State as well as superior orders in justificationor mitigation of any crime he may have committed in the execution ofthe Night and Fog decree. The basis for individual liability for crimescommitted and the law relating thereto was clearly and ably declared bythe IMT judgment which reads as follows:   It was submitted that international law is concerned with   the actions of sovereign states, and provides no punishment   for individuals; and further, that where the act in question   is an act of state, those who carry it out are not personally   responsible, but are protected by the doctrine of the   sovereignty of the State. In the opinion of the Tribunal, both   these submissions must be rejected. That international law   imposes duties and liabilities upon individuals as well as   upon States has long been recognized. In the recent case of   _Ex parte Quirin_ (1942 317 U. S. 1), before the Supreme   Court of the United States, persons were charged during the war   with landing in the United States for purposes of spying and   sabotage. The late Chief Justice Stone, speaking for the Court,   said:   From the very beginning of its history this Court has applied   the law of war as including that part of the law of nations   which prescribes for the conduct of war, the status, rights, and   duties of enemy nations as well as enemy individuals.   He went on to give a list of cases tried by the Courts, where   individual offenders were charged with offenses against the   laws of nations, and particularly the laws of war. Many other   authorities could be cited, but enough has been said to show   that individuals can be punished for violations of international   law. Crimes against international law are committed by men, not   by abstract entities, and only by punishing individuals who   commit such crimes can the provisions of international law be   enforced.[658]_RACIAL PERSECUTION_The record contains innumerable acts of persecution of individualPoles and Jews, but to consider these cases as isolated and unrelatedinstances of perversion of justice would be to overlook the veryessence of the offense charged in the indictment. The defendantsare not now charged with conspiracy as a separate and substantiveoffense, but it is alleged that they participated in carrying out agovernmental plan and program for the persecution and exterminationof Jews and Poles, a plan which transcended territorial boundariesas well as the bounds of human decency. Some of the defendants tookpart in the enactment of laws and decrees the purpose of whichwas the extermination of Poles and Jews in Germany and throughoutEurope. Others, in executive positions, actively participated inthe enforcement of those laws and in atrocities, illegal even underGerman law, in furtherance of the declared national purpose. Others,as judges, distorted and then applied the laws and decrees againstPoles and Jews as such in disregard of every principle of judicialbehavior. The overt acts of the several defendants must be seen andunderstood as deliberate contributions toward the effectuation of thepolicy of the Party and State. The discriminatory laws themselvesformed the subject matter of war crimes and crimes against humanitywith which the defendants are charged. The material facts which mustbe proved in any case are (1) the fact of the great pattern or planof racial persecution and extermination; and (2) specific conductof the individual defendant in furtherance of the plan. This is butan application of general concepts of criminal law. The person whopersuades another to commit murder, the person who furnishes the lethalweapon for the purpose of its commission, and the person who pulls thetrigger are all principals or accessories to the crime.We turn to the national pattern or plan for racial extermination.Fundamentally, the program was one for the actual extermination ofJews and Poles, either by means of killing or by confinement inconcentration camps, which merely made death slower and more painful.But lesser forms of racial persecution were universally practiced bygovernmental authority and constituted an integral part in the generalpolicy of the Reich. We have already noted the decree by which Jewswere excluded from the legal profession. Intermarriage between Jewsand persons of German blood was prohibited. Sexual intercourse betweenJews and German nationals was punished with extreme severity by thecourts. By other decrees Jews were almost completely expelled frompublic service, from educational institutions, and from many businessenterprises. Upon the death of a Jew his property was confiscated.Under the provisions for confiscation under the 11th amendment to theGerman Citizenship Law, _supra_, the decision as to confiscationof the property of living Jews was left to the chief of the SecurityPolice and the SD. The law against Poles and Jews cited _supra_(4 December 1941) was rigorously enforced. Poles and Jews convicted ofspecific crimes were subjected to different types of punishment fromthat imposed upon Germans who had committed the same crimes. Theirrights as defendants in court were severely circumscribed. Courtswere empowered to impose death sentences on Poles and Jews even wheresuch punishment was not prescribed by law, if the evidence showedparticularly objectionable motives. And, finally, the police weregiven _carte blanche_ to punish all criminal acts committed byJews without any employment of the judicial process. From the greatmass of evidence we can only cite a few illustrations of the characterand operation of the program.On 30 January 1939 in an address before the Reichstag, Hitler, who wasat that very time perfecting his plot for aggressive war, said:   If the international Jewish financiers within and without   Europe succeed in plunging the nations once more into a world   war, then the result will not be the Bolshevization of the world   and thereby the victory of Jewry, but the obliteration of the   Jewish race in Europe.We quote from the writings of Alfred Rosenberg (since hanged), HighPriest of the Nazi Racial Theory and Herald of the Master Race:   A new faith is arising today--the myth of the blood, the   faith to defend with the blood the divine essence of man. The   faith, embodied in clearest knowledge, that the Nordic blood   represents that mysterium which has replaced and overcome the   old sacraments.[659]The Rosenberg philosophy strongly supported the program of the NaziParty, which reads as follows:   None but members of the nation (Volk) may be citizens of the   State. None but those of German blood, whatever their creed, may   be members of the nation. No Jew, therefore, may be a member of   the nation.It was to implement this program that the discriminatory laws againstPoles and Jews were enacted as hereinabove set forth.A directive of the Reich Ministry of Justice, signed by Freisler, dated7 August 1942, addressed to prosecutors and judges, set forth thebroad general purposes which were to govern the application of the lawagainst Poles and Jews and the specific application of that law in thetrial of cases. We quote (_NG-744, Pros. Ex. 500_):   The penal law ordinance of 4 December 1941 concerning Poles was   intended not only to serve as a criminal law against Poles and   Jews, but beyond that also to provide general principles for   the German administration of law to adopt in all its judicial   dealings with Poles and Jews, irrespective of the role which   the Poles and Jews play in the individual proceedings. The   regulations of article IX for instance, according to which Poles   and Jews are not to be sworn in, apply to proceedings against   Germans as well. * * *   1. Proceedings against Germans should be carried on whenever   possible without calling Poles and Jews as witnesses. If,   however, such a testimony cannot be evaded, the Pole or Jew   must not appear as a witness against the German during the main   trial. He must always be interrogated by a judge who has been   appointed or requested to do so, * * *.   2. Evidence given by Poles and Jews during proceedings against   Germans must be received with the utmost caution especially in   those cases where other evidence is lacking.On 13 October 1942 the Reich Minister of Justice Thierack wrote toReichsleiter Bormann, in part as follows (_NG-558, Pros. Ex. 143_):   With a view to freeing the German people of Poles, Russians,   Jews, and gypsies, and with a view to making the eastern   territories which have been incorporated into the Reich   available for settlements for German nationals, I intend to turn   over criminal proceedings against Poles, Russians, Jews, and   gypsies to the Reich Leader SS. In so doing I base myself on   the principle that the administration of justice can only make   a small contribution to the extermination of members of these   peoples. The justice administration undoubtedly pronounces very   severe sentences on such persons, but that is not enough to   constitute any material contribution toward the realization of   the above-mentioned aim.On 18 September 1942 a conference was held among Thierack, Himmler,Bormann, Rothenberger, and others. The notes of the conference, signedby Thierack, disclose that the subjects of discussion included specialtreatment at the hands of the police in cases where judicial sentenceswere not severe enough. Among other points agreed upon betweenBormann, Himmler, and Thierack, were the following (_654-PS, Pros.Ex. 39_):   The Reich Minister of Justice will decide whether and when   special treatment at the hands of the police is to be applied. *   * *   The delivery of asocial elements while serving penal sentences   to the Reich Leader of SS to be worked to death. Persons under   security detention, Jews, gypsies, Russians, and Ukrainians,   Poles with more than 3-year sentences, Czechs and Germans with   more than 8-year sentences will be turned over without exception   according to the decision of the Reich Minister for Justice.   First of all the worst asocial elements among those just   mentioned are to be handed over. I shall inform the Fuehrer of   this through Reichsleiter Bormann. * * *   It is agreed that, in consideration of the intended aims of   the government for the clearing up of the eastern problems,   in future Jews, Poles, gypsies, Russians, Ukrainians are no   longer to be judged by the ordinary courts, so far as punishable   offenses are concerned, but are to be dealt with by the Reich   Leader SS. * * *The defendant Rothenberger testified that he was not present when theseagreements were made. However that may be, it is clear that they cameto his notice shortly thereafter.Of special significance is the record concerning the establishment ofpenal laws for Poles and Jews in the annexed eastern territories. On 17April 1941 the defendant Schlegelberger addressed a letter to the ReichMinister and chief of the Reich Chancellery. In it he states that assoon as the Special Courts were introduced in the eastern territoriesunder the decree of 5 September 1939 he tried to make those courtswith their particularly prompt and energetic procedure centers forcombating all Polish and Jewish crime. He states that the procedureof compulsory prosecution was rescinded, at is seems intolerable thatPoles and Jews should in this way compel the German prosecutor toissue an indictment. Poles and Jews were also prohibited from raisingprivate actions and accessory actions. He further states:   On being informed of the Fuehrers intention to discriminate   in the sphere of penal law between the Poles (and probably the   Jews as well), and the Germans, I prepared, after preliminary   discussions with the presidents of the courts of appeal and   the attorney generals of the annexed eastern territories, the   attached draft concerning the administration of the penal laws   against Poles and Jews in the annexed eastern territories and in   the territory of the former Free City of Danzig.Again, he says:   So far I have been in agreement with the opinion held by the   Fuehrers deputy, on the fact that a Pole is less sensitive to   the imposition of an ordinary prison sentence. Therefore, I had   taken administrative measures to ensure that Poles and Jews   be separated from other prisoners and that their imprisonment   be rendered more severe. Number 3 goes still farther and   substitutes for the terms of imprisonment and hard labor   prescribed by Reich law other prison sentences of a new kind,   viz, the prison camp and the more rigorous prison camp.Speaking of the proposed draft prepared by him, Schlegelberger said:   The part concerned with procedure contains first the special   regulations existing up to now of the preliminary decree. In   addition, a Pole and a Jew sentenced by a German court is not to   be allowed in the future any legal remedy against the judgment;   neither will he have a right of appeal, or be allowed to ask   that the case be reopened. All sentences will take effect   immediately. In future, Poles and Jews will also no longer be   allowed to object to German judges on the grounds of prejudice;   nor will they be able to take an oath. Coercive measures against   them are permissible under easier conditions.A memorandum dated 22 April 1941, bearing the same file number as theletter of Schlegelberger, states that Schlegelberger has transmittedthe proposed draft, and adds:   The draft establishes a draconic special criminal law for Poles   and Jews, giving a wide range for the interpretations of the   facts of the case, with the death penalty applicable throughout.   The conditions of imprisonment are also much more severe than   provided for in the German criminal law.The note further states:   The Minister of Justice differs only in two points from the   suggestions of the Fuehrers deputy.It then states that the Fuehrers deputy considered it more appropriateto authorize the Reich governors to introduce the special criminallaw, whereas the Minister of Justice provides for its introduction bya Reich decree. The second difference of opinion was somewhat to thecredit of the defendant Schlegelberger. The Fuehrers deputy consideredthe introduction of corporal punishment appropriate, and the Ministerof Justice refused to agree.On 3 August 1942 the Reich Minister of Justice sent a draft of theproposed ordinance to a number of high officials, including the ReichMinister of Interior and the Reich Minister for Popular Enlightenmentand Propaganda. The letter was signed By order: Freisler. Freislerwas at that time State Secretary in the Reich Ministry of Justice. Theletter contained this significant statement:   I have emphasized the importance in war of this ordinance   because it indirectly serves national defense.The enclosed draft provided that Jews should not be entitled to makeuse of the right of appeal, revision, or complaint against decisionsin criminal cases, and could not appeal to the courts for a decisionagainst sentences inflicted by the police. It also provided that incases where an appeal had already been filed it should be consideredcancelled.On 13 August 1942 the Reich Minister of Interior wrote to the ReichMinister of Justice, requesting that the draft be extended so as torestrict the right of Jews to appeal in administrative as well ascriminal cases. On the same day the defendant Schlegelberger wrote tothe Reich Minister for Popular Enlightenment and Propaganda concerningthe addition to the draft as suggested by the Reich Minister of theInterior. We quote:   I declare that I have no objections against an extension of   my draft to matters of administrative law and to decisions by   administrative authorities.He then suggested an additional provision to the effect that Jewsshould be forbidden to testify on oath, but that they might beprosecuted as for perjury though no oath is to be taken.On 8 March 1943 the Chief of the Security Police and the SD,Kaltenbrunner,[660] wrote to Minister of the Interior Frick urgingimmediate passage of the proposed ordinance. The following reasons weregiven:   1. Previous evacuations of Jews have been restricted to Jews   who were not married to non-Jews. In consequence, the numbers of   Jews who have remained in the interior is quite considerable.   As the ordinance would also include these Jews as well, the   measures it plans are not objectless.   2. The provision of article 7 of the ordinance according   to which, at the death of a Jew, his fortune escheats in   its entirety to the Reich, results in the accumulation of   considerably less work for the State Police. At the present   time the procedure used by the State Police in handling the   confiscation of such Jewish inheritances must frequently be   modified to suit each special case.He adds that the provision for the transfer of Jews to the police isbased on an agreement between Himmler and Thierack, who had by thattime succeeded Schlegelberger as Reich Minister of Justice.On 21 April 1943 a memorandum for the files of the Reich Chancelleryreports a conference of State secretaries on the proposed ordinance atwhich the defendant Rothenberger was present. The conference came tothe conclusion that certain modifications should be made. The finalresult of the prolonged discussion was the enactment of the 13thregulation under the Reich Citizenship Law of 1 July 1943, which wassigned by Frick, Bormann, and Thierack. It will be recalled that thatregulation, _supra_, provided that criminal actions committedby Jews should be punished by the police; that the property of a Jewshould be confiscated after his death. These and other provisions werealso made effective in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia whereGerman courts had jurisdiction.With few exceptions Jews were wholly excluded from the administrationof justice. In a speech before the NSDAP congress on 14 September 1934,Hans Frank stated:   It is unbearable to us to permit Jews to play any role   whatsoever in the German administration of justice. * * * It   will therefore be our firm aim to exclude Jews increasingly from   the administration of the law as time goes on.On another occasion Frank, as president of the Academy for German Law,directed: For all future time it will be impossible that Jews will actin the name of German Law. * * *In an order reminiscent of the burning of the books in medieval days,Frank also directed that the works of Jewish authors should be removedfrom all public or study libraries whenever possible.On 5 April 1933 the defendant Barnickel made an entry in his diary:   Today it is said in the newspaper that in Berlin there are   about 3,500 attorneys and more than half of them are Jewish.   Only 35 of them are to be admitted as lawyers. * * * To exclude   these Jewish attorneys from one day to the next means terrible   brutality.The defense witness, Fritz Wallentin, stated that in general allnon-Aryan judges were removed from the administration of penal justicevery soon after 30 January 1933. The evacuation of Jews to the East forextermination was in full swing at least as early as November 1941, andcontinued through the war years thereafter. As an illustration of thenature of this program as carried out throughout the Reich, we citethe report of the Secret State Police Main Office, Nuernberg-Fuerth;Branch Office Wuerzburg. This report refers to the deportation froma comparatively small area around the city of Wuerzburg and showsevacuation of Jews to the East in the following numbers: On 27 July1941, 202 persons; on 24 March 1942, 208 persons; on 25 April 1942,850 persons; on 10 September 1942 (to Theresienstadt) 177 persons; on23 September 1942 (to Theresienstadt) 562 persons; on 17 June 1943 (toTheresienstadt) seven persons; on 17 June 1943, 57 Jews were evacuatedto the East. The report continues: With this last transport, all theJews who had to be evacuated according to instructions issued haveleft Main-Franken. The report shows that the total number of 2,063Jews were evacuated from the Main-Franken area alone. The furniture,clothing and laundry items left by the Jews were given to the financeoffices of Main-Franken and turned into cash by them.Even before transfers to the Gestapo had been substituted for judicialprocedure the position of a Pole or a Jew who was tried by the courtswas not a happy one. The right of self defense on the part of a Polewas specifically limited. Poles and Jews could not challenge a Germanjudge for prejudice. Other limitations upon the right of appeal andthe like are set forth, _supra_ (law against Poles and Jews, 4December 1941).On 22 July 1942 Reich Minister Goebbels stated that it was anuntenable situation that still today a Jew could protest against thecharge of the president of the police, who was an old Party member anda high SS Leader. The Jew should not be granted any legal remedy at allnor any right of protest.The defendant Lautz testified that according to the provisions ofdecree which antedated the war and by reason of the general regulationsof the law in every case it had to be pointed out in the indictment ifthe person was a Jew or of mixed race.On 23 January 1943 the Oberlandesgericht president at Koenigsberg wroteto the Minister of Justice concerning defense of Poles before tribunalsin Incorporated Eastern Territories. We quote:   The decree of 21 May 1942 * * * states that in accordance   with the order on penal justice in Poland of 4 December 1941   attorneys are not (to) undertake the defense of Polish persons   before tribunals in the Incorporated Eastern Territories. This   decree has been received with satisfaction by all the judges and   prosecutors in the whole of my district.These directives by the authorities in the Reich under Hitler were notmere idle threats. The policies and laws were rigorously enforced. Wequote from a sworn statement of former defendant Karl Engert as follows:   The handing over to the Gestapo of Jews, Poles, and gypsies was   not under my supervision, but under that of Mr. Hecker, who   worked under me in my division. However, he was not responsible   to me, but directly to the Minister Thierack. Again he said:   About 12,000 inmates of the correction houses were assigned   for transfer to the Gestapo. * * * Out of the total 12,000 my   division assigned 3,000 for transfer in 1942. How many Jews,   Poles, and gypsies were assigned I do not know; that must be in   the statistics.Reich Minister Goebbels, in an address to the judges of the PeoplesCourt, on 22 July 1942, stated that if still more than 40,000 Jews,whom we considered enemies of the State, could go freely about inBerlin, this was solely due to the lack of sufficient means oftransportation. Otherwise the Jews would have been in the East longago.Between 9 and 11 November 1938, a pogrom was carried out againstthe Jews throughout the Reich, and upon direct orders from Berlin.Defense witness Peter Eiffe testified that he heard rumors of theproposed pogrom on the night of 8 November and called at the Ministryof Propaganda where he was told that somebody has let the cat out ofthe bag again. During the 3-day period Jewish property was destroyedthroughout the Reich and thousands of Jews were arrested.In Berlin the destruction of Jewish property was particularly great. Tocap the climax on 12 November 1938, Field Marshal Goering issued thefollowing decree:[661]   Article I.--All damage done due to the indignation of the   people at the incitement of international Jewry against   Nationalist Socialist Germany carried out on the 8, 9, and 10   November 1938, on Jewish enterprises and living quarters is to   be removed by the Jewish owners immediately.   Article II.--The costs of restoration are to be borne by the   owner of the Jewish business concerned * * *.   Section 2.--Insurance claims of Jews of German nationality will   be confiscated in favor of the Reich.For this purpose a fine of one billion marks was imposed upon the Jews.The witness Schulz, who was an attorney in Berlin, acted in behalf ofFrau Liebermann, the widow of the internationally known artist, MaxLiebermann. Frau Liebermann was at that time 80 years old and the shareof the fine imposed upon her was 280,000 marks. Ultimately orders wereissued for her deportation to the East. She, however, died, either fromheart failure or poison, as she descended the steps to be carried away.Defense witness Schulz[662] also testified concerning other methods ofJewish persecution. He said:   * * * When a Jew wanted to emigrate, I had much to do with it.   He had to pay the Reich escape tax, that was so and so much   percent of his property and then a large amount was taken away   from him by assessing his property very high. After all of that   was done and the day he went to the passport office in order to   get his clearance, his passport, and get his visa then he was   told that now he still had to go to the notary, Dr. Stege, and   had to deposit a voluntary fee to promote the emigration of the   Jews, and that is where he paid the balance, and then left with   his personal satchel, with his little valise.Speaking of the asocial persons, Dr. Thierack, on 5 January 1943, ata mass meeting of the NSDAP, stated (_NG-275, Pros. Ex. 25_):   I have seen to it that these people shall no longer be employed   for any sort of work that is not dangerous. The most dangerous   tasks are just the thing that is for them. Now, today, when   thousands of these people are carrying supplies in the far north   or building roads, I cannot help it if some of them die, but at   least they are of some use.The Roman Catholic chaplain at Amberg prison stated under oath thata large proportion of the inmates of that prison were Poles whohad been sentenced under the Poles Act. Many of them died fromundernourishment. They were forced to eat potato peelings and huntthrough rubbish heaps for eatable refuse. From this prison asocialelements were picked out and sent in batches to the Mauthausenconcentration camp. All of the first batch was said to have perished.Among the prisoners were Jews who had been sentenced for race pollution.The witness Hecker stated under oath that after Thieracks doubtfuldecree concerning the transfer of Jews, Poles, and gypsies, prisonersin protective custody, and asocial elements from the justice prisons tothe RSHA in the autumn of 1942, the Jews as a whole were immediatelyhanded over. The work was carried out by Department V of the Ministryof Justice. Lists were prepared monthly and sent to Minister Thierackthrough the chief of the department.On 22 October 1942 a directive (_648-PS, Pros. Ex. 264_) underthe letterhead of the Reich Minister of Justice was issued to variousprosecuting officers in which it was stated that by agreement withthe Reich Leader SS, lawfully sentenced prisoners confined in penalinstitutions will be transferred to the custody of the Reich LeaderSS. Those designated for transfer to the SS included Jews, men andwomen, detained under arrest, protective custody, or in the workhouse;* * * and Poles, residing in the former Polish state territory on 1September 1939, men and women, sentenced to penal camps or subsequentlyturned over for penal execution, if sentence is above 3 years, * **. With completion of the transfer to the police, the penal term isconsidered interrupted. Transfer to the police is to be reported tothe penal authority and in cases of custody to the superior executiveauthority, with the information that the interruption of the penal termhas been ordered by the Reich Ministry of Justice. The directive issigned Dr. Crohne.A secret directive dated Berlin, 5 November 1942, was issued to theheads of the SS and to the police services, in which it was stated(_L-316, Pros. Ex. 265_):   Re: Jurisdiction over Poles and eastern nationals.   I. The Reich Leader SS has come to an arrangement with the   Reich Minister of Justice Thierack whereby the justice waives   the execution of the usual penal procedure against Poles and   eastern nationals. These persons of alien race are in future to   be handed over to the police. Jews and gypsies are to be treated   in the same way. This agreement has been approved by the Fuehrer.   II. This agreement is based on the following considerations:   Poles and eastern nationals are alien and racially inferior   people living in the German Reich territory.The order continues:   Such considerations which may be right for adjudicating a   punishable offense committed by a German are however wrong for   adjudicating a punishable offense committed by a person of alien   race. * * * As a result of this, the administration of penal law   for persons of alien race must be transferred from the hands of   the administrators of justice into the hands of the police.On 24 September 1942 the defendant Joel prepared a secret reportconcerning the Reich Marshals plans for action in the Occupied EasternTerritories. The report states that the Reich Marshal is looking fordaring fellows who will be employed in the East for special purposesand who will be able to carry out tasks of creating confusion behindthe lines. The suggestion was that poachers and fanatical membersof smuggling gangs who take part in gun battles on the frontiers,should be employed for this purpose. A copy of the report was sent toState Secretary Rothenberger for his attention and was submitted inconnection with a proposed conference to be held on 9 October 1942.Minutes of a conference of 9 October 1942, signed by Dr. Crohne,incorporate the substance of Joels report, and state that the poachershave already been turned over to the Reich Leader SS for specialduties. The report recommends that the district attorneys be given thetask of obtaining the convicts for this special service, and providesfurther (_662-PS, Pros. Ex. 263_):   _Delivery of asocial convicts._--Persons in penal   institutions designated as asocial persons by judicial decision   are to be turned over to the Reich Leader SS.   1. _Persons in custody for reasons of security._--Persons   in custody for reasons of security who are in German penal   institutions will be put at the disposal of the Reich Leader SS.   The execution of sentence will be regarded as interrupted by the   delivery. * * *   _b._ Whether women are also to be delivered is still   doubtful. * * * In this regard it will have to be a fundamental   point from the beginning that in the case of female Poles, Jews,   and gypsies no doubt about the delivery can exist.   _c._ Foreigners are not affected. Poles, Russians,   Ukrainians, Jews, and gypsies do not rank as foreigners. * * *.   2. _Jews, gypsies, Russians, and Ukrainians_ will be   delivered to the Reich Leader SS without exception.   3. _Poles._--Ethnic Poles who are subject to the Polish   criminal law regulations, or have been delivered to the Polish   penal authorities, and who have more than 3 years sentence to   serve, will be delivered to the Reich Leader SS.   Poles with smaller sentences will remain in the custody of   the prison system. After serving their sentences they will be   reported by name to the police just the same.It will be observed that the decisions concerning special treatmentfor Poles and Jews which were reached at this conference of 9 October1942 antedate by almost 9 months the enactment of the 13th regulationconcerning the Reich Citizenship Law of 1 July 1943 which providedthat criminal actions committed by Jews shall be punished by thepolice.On 1 April 1943 a letter from the Reich Ministry of Justice to thepublic prosecutors of the courts of appeal and others stated that theReich Security Office has directed by the decree of 11 March 1943 asfollows:   _a._ Jews, who in accordance with number VI of the guiding   principles, are released from a penal institution, are to be   taken by the State police (chief) office competent for the   district in which the penal institution is located, for the rest   of their lives to the concentration camps Auschwitz or Lublin   in accordance with the regulations for protective custody that   have been issued. The same applies to Jews who in the future are   released from a penal institution after serving a sentence of   confinement.   _b._ Poles, who in accordance with number VI of the   guiding principles, are released from a penal institution, are   to be taken by the State police (chief) office competent for   the district in which the penal institution is located, for the   duration of the war to a concentration camp in accordance with   the regulations on protective custody that have been issued.   The same applies in the future to Poles who after serving a   term of imprisonment of more than 6 months are to be discharged   by a penal institution.It was stated that the ruling replaces previous orders. The instrumentis stamped Reich Ministry of Justice and is signed by Dr. Eichler.As a crowning example of fanatical imbecility, we cite the followingdocument issued in April 1943 which was sent to the desk of thedefendant Rothenberger for his attention and was initialed by him(_NG-1656, Pros. Ex. 535_):    The Reich Minister of Justice    Information for the Fuehrer    1943 No.   After the birth of her child a full-blooded Jewess sold her   mothers milk to a pediatrician and concealed that she was a   Jewess. With this milk babies of German blood were fed in a   nursing home for children. The accused will be charged with   deception. The buyers of the milk have suffered damage, for   mothers milk from a Jewess cannot be regarded as food for   German children. The impudent behavior of the accused is an   insult as well. Relevant charges, however, have not been applied   for, so that the parents, who are unaware of the true facts,   need not subsequently be worried.   I shall discuss with the Reich health leader the   racial-hygienic aspect of the case.   Berlin, April 1943.The witness Lammers, former Chief of the Reich Chancellery, testifiedas follows:[663]   Q. * * * Now, you answered Dr. Kubuschok that the subject of   sterilization of half-Jews was an alternative to their being   moved to the East and that it had been raised by half-Jews   themselves in 1942 or prior thereto.   A. Yes. I said so.He testified further that the half-Jews were not subject to anycompulsion. He was apparently of the opinion that a person was a freeagent if he had a choice between sterilization and deportation to aconcentration camp.It will be recalled that the law of 4 December 1941 against Polesand Jews applied to the Incorporated Eastern Territories. Thoseterritories were seized in the course of criminal aggressive war, butaside from the fact it is clear, as we have indicated, _supra_,that the purported annexation was premature and invalid under the lawsand customs of war. The so-called annexed territories in Poland werein reality nothing more than territory under belligerent occupationof the military forces of Germany. The extension to and applicationin these territories of the discriminatory law against Poles and Jewswas in furtherance of the avowed purpose of racial persecution andextermination. In the passing and enforcement of that law the occupyingpower in our opinion violated the provisions of the Hague Conventionfrom which we quote:   Until a more complete code of the laws of war has been issued,   the high contracting parties deem it expedient to declare that,   in cases not included in the regulations adopted by them, the   inhabitants and the belligerents remain under the protection and   the rule of the principles of the law of nations, as they result   from the usages established among civilized peoples, from the   laws of humanity, and the dictates of the public conscience.Other relevant portions are as follows:   _Article 43._--The authority of the legitimate power   having in fact passed into the hands of the occupant, the latter   shall take all the measures in his power to restore, and insure,   as far as possible, public order and safety, while respecting,   unless absolutely prevented, the laws in force in the country.   _Article 46._--Family honor and rights, the lives of   persons, and private property, as well as religious convictions   and practice, must be respected. Private property cannot be   confiscated. (_Hague Convention No. IV of 18 October 1907_   36 Stat. 2277; Treaty Series No. 539; Mallory Treaties, Vol. 2,   page 2269.)The prosecutions which were proposed by Lautz cannot be justifiedupon any honest claim of military necessity. As a lawyer of ability,he must have known that the proposed procedure was in violation ofinternational law.Although the authorities are not in accord as to the properconstruction of article 23h of the regulations annexed to the HagueConvention of 1907, we are of the opinion that the introduction andenforcement of the law against Poles and Jews in occupied Polandresulted in a violation of that provision which is as follows:   It is forbidden to declare abolished, suspended, or   inadmissible in a court of law the right and actions of the   nationals of the hostile party.[664]The evidence discloses that the transfer of persons to concentrationcamps was done even before the war and on direct orders of Hitler. Dr.Lammers, Chief of the Reich Chancellery, on 8 August 1939, notified theReich Minister of Justice that the Fuehrer has given an order that alldispensable persons in security detention are to be put at the disposalof the Reich Leader SS immediately. The same procedure was employed asto persons who had never been convicted.On 24 January 1939, a conference was held at which reports werereceived from eight different court districts. The subject wasProtective Custody after Serving Term of Imprisonment, afterAcquittal, after Release from Imprisonment on Remand. Among the casesreported were those of defendants who were taken into custody by thepolice in the court room immediately after their acquittal. Others weretaken by the police in cases where there had been a refusal to issue awarrant of arrest. The report on the Hamburg situation by the defendantRothenberger states that the number of persons taken into protectivecustody has increased. Rothenberger reports that in six cases Jewishwomen had been taken into protective custody because of sexualintercourse with Aryans. He quotes the State Police file as follows:   1. Protective custody, to make the punishment finally   effective * * *.   2. Protective custody, to make the served sentences still more   effective * * *.   3. Protective custody, because of the big number of previous   convictions.   4. Protective custody to prevent prejudicing the course of   justice through the interference of lawyers as defense counsel.    The report on the conference ends as follows:   The Minister concludes the discussion by indicating that it is   to be the task of the chief presidents to see that arrests in   the court room by the State Police are avoided, and recommends   for the rest to maintain the connection with the State Police.    The report is signed by the defendant Klemm.Former defendant Engert as vice president of the Peoples Court, andThierack, the president of the Peoples Court, protested in Julyand August 1940 against the trial of minor cases in the PeoplesCourt as not being compatible with the dignity of the tribunal andsuggested that the defendants in such cases should be transferred to aconcentration camp. As Thierack put it--   However right it is to exterminate harshly and uproot all the   seeds of insurrection, as for example we see them in Bohemia and   Moravia, it is wrong for every follower, even the smallest, to   be given the honor of appearing for trial and being judged for   high treason before a Peoples Court or, failing that, before   an appellate court. In order to deal with these small cases and   even with the smallest, the culprits should surely be shown   that German sovereignty will not put up with their behavior   and that it will take action accordingly. But that can also be   done in a different way and I think in a more advantageous one,   than through the tedious and also very expensive and ponderous   channels of court procedure. I have therefore no objection   whatsoever, if all the small hangers-on who are somehow   connected with the high treason plans which have been woven by   others are brought to their senses by being transferred to a   concentration camp for some time.As early as 29 January 1941 the senior public prosecutor at Hamm wroteto the Reich Minister of Justice, for the attention of State SecretarySchlegelberger (_NG-685, Pros. Ex. 259_):   Upon inquiry, the Reich Trustee for Labor for the economic   territory of Westphalia-Lower Rhine has informed me that in   accordance with an agreement between the Reich Minister for   Labor and the Reich Leader SS as Chief of the German Police,   breach of work contracts by Poles are to be punished by the   Secret State Police with protective custody or concentration   camps. The meaning of this step--so writes this Reich   trustee--is that in the case of Poles the strictest measures   are to be taken at once * * *. For this reason we made it a   point in my office to transfer the cases involving breaches   of work contracts by Polish civilian workers, to the Gestapo   (Secret State Police) for further action.The same letter informs the defendant Schlegelberger of uncertaintywhich has arisen in the treatment of Polish civilians because in somecases the courts would sentence to 2 or 3 years imprisonment while theState Police may pronounce the death sentence for the same crime.While the part played by the Ministry of Justice in the exterminationof Poles and Jews was small compared to the mass extermination ofmillions by the SS and Gestapo in concentration camps, nevertheless thecourts contributed greatly to the final solution of the problem. Froma secret report from the office of the Reich Minister of Justice tothe judges and prosecutors, including the defendant Lautz, it appearsthat 189 persons were sentenced under the law for the protection ofGerman blood and honor in 1941, and 109 in 1942. In the year 1942,61,836 persons were convicted under the law against Poles and Jews.This figure includes persons convicted in the Incorporated EasternTerritories, and also convictions for crimes committed in otherdistricts of the German Reich by Jews and Poles who on 1 September1939 had their residence or permanent place of abode in territory ofthe former Polish state. These figures, of course, do not include anycases in which Jews were convicted of other crimes in which the law of4 December 1941 was not involved.The defendants contend that they were unaware of the atrocitiescommitted by the Gestapo and in concentration camps. This contentionis subject to serious question. Dr. Behl testified that he consideredit impossible that anyone, particularly in Berlin, should have beenignorant of the brutalities of the SS and the Gestapo. He said: InBerlin it would have been hardly possible for anybody not to know aboutit, and certainly not for anybody who was a lawyer and who dealt withthe administration of justice. He testified specifically that he couldnot imagine that any person in the Ministry of Justice, or in the PartyChancellery, or as a practicing attorney or a judge of a Special (or)Peoples Court could be in ignorance of the facts of common knowledgeconcerning the treatment of prisoners in concentration camps. It hasbeen repeatedly urged by and in behalf of various defendants that theyremained in the Ministry of Justice because they feared that if theyshould retire, control of the matters pertaining to the Ministry ofJustice would be transferred to Himmler and the Gestapo. In short, theyclaim that they were withstanding the evil encroachments of Himmlerupon the justice administration, and yet we are asked to believe thatthey were ignorant of the character of the forces which they say theywere opposing. We concur in the finding of the first Tribunal in thecase of United States et al. _vs._ Goering, et al., concerning theuse of concentration camps. We quote:   Their original purpose was to imprison without trial all those   persons who were opposed to the government, or who were in any   way obnoxious to German authority. With the aid of a secret   police force, this practice was widely extended, and in course   of time concentration camps became places of organized and   systematic murder where millions of people were destroyed.          *       *       *       *       *       *       *   A certain number of the concentration camps were equipped with   gas chambers for the wholesale destruction of the inmates, and   with furnaces for the burning of the bodies. Some of them were   in fact used for the extermination of Jews as part of the final   solution of the Jewish problem.          *       *       *       *       *       *       *   In Poland and the Soviet Union these crimes were part of a   plan to get rid of whole native populations by expulsion and   annihilation, in order that their territory could be used for   colonization by Germans. Hitler had written in Mein Kampf on   these lines, and the plan was clearly stated by Himmler in July   1942, when he wrote:   It is not our task to Germanize the East in the old sense,   that is to teach the people there the German language and the   German law, but to see to it that only people of purely Germanic   blood live in the East.[665]A large proportion of all of the Jews in Germany were transported tothe East. Millions of persons disappeared from Germany and the occupiedterritory without a trace. They were herded into concentration campswithin and without Germany. Thousands of soldiers and members ofthe Gestapo and SS must have been instrumental in the processes ofdeportation, torture, and extermination. The mere task of disposal ofmountainous piles of corpses (evidence of which we have seen) becamea serious problem and the subject of disagreement between the variousorganizations involved. The thousands of Germans who took part in theatrocities must have returned from time to time to their homes in theReich. The atrocities were of a magnitude unprecedented in the historyof the world. Are we to believe that no whisper reached the ears ofthe public or of those officials who were most concerned? Did thedefendants think that the nationwide pogrom of November 1938 officiallydirected from Berlin and Hitlers announcement to the Reichstagthreatening the obliteration of the Jewish race in Europe wereunrelated? At least they cannot plead ignorance concerning the decreeswhich were published in their official organ, The Reichsgesetzblatt.Therefore, they knew that Jews were to be punished by the police inGermany and in Bohemia and Moravia. They knew that the property of Jewswas confiscated on death of the owner. They knew that the law againstPoles and Jews had been extended to occupied territories, and they knewthat the Chief of the Security Police was the official authorized todetermine whether or not Jewish property was subject to confiscation.They could hardly be ignorant of the fact that the infamous lawagainst Poles and Jews of 4 December 1941 directed the Reich Ministerof Justice himself, together with the Minister of the Interior, toissue legal and administrative regulations for implementation of thedecree. They read _The Stuermer_. They listened to the radio.They received and sent directives. They heard and delivered lectures.This Tribunal is not so gullible as to believe these defendants sostupid that they did not know what was going on. One man can keep asecret, two men may, but thousands, never.The evidence conclusively establishes the adoption and application ofsystematic government-organized and approved procedures amounting toatrocities and offenses of the kind made punishable by C. C. Law 10and committed against populations and amounting to persecution onracial grounds. These procedures when carried out in occupied territoryconstituted war crimes and crimes against humanity. When enforced inthe Alt Reich against German nationals they constituted crimes againsthumanity.The pattern and plan of racial persecution has been made clear. Generalknowledge of the broad outlines thereof in all its immensity has beenbrought home to the defendants. The remaining question is whether ornot the evidence proves beyond a reasonable doubt in the case of theindividual defendants that they each consciously participated in theplan or took a consenting part therein.                    _THE DEFENDANT SCHLEGELBERGER_The defendant Franz Schlegelberger was born on 23 October 1875 inKoenigsberg. He received the degree of doctor of law at the Universityof Leipzig in 1899 and passed the higher state law examination in 1901.He is the author of several law books. His first employment was as anassistant judge at the local court in Koenigsberg. In 1904 he becamejudge at the district court at Lyck. In 1908 he was appointed judgeof the local court in Berlin and in the fall of the same year wasappointed as an assistant judge of the Berlin Court of Appeals. He wasthen appointed councillor of the Berlin Court of Appeals in 1914, wherehe worked until 1918. During the First World War, on 1 April 1918 hebecame an assistant to the Reich Board of Justice. On 1 October 1918he was appointed Privy Government Councillor and department chief. In1927 he was appointed ministerial director in the Reich Ministry ofJustice. On 10 October 1931 he was appointed Secretary of State in theReich Ministry of Justice under Minister of Justice Guertner, whichposition he held until Guertners death. Upon Guertners death on 29January 1941 Schlegelberger was put in charge of the Reich Ministry ofJustice as administrative Secretary of State. When Thierack became thenew Minister of Justice on 20 August 1942, Schlegelberger resigned fromthe Ministry.In 1938 Hitler ordered Schlegelberger to join the NSDAP. Schlegelbergertestified that he made no use of the Party, that he never attendeda Party meeting, that none of his family belonged to the Party, andthat Party attitudes often rendered his position difficult. However,upon his retirement as Acting Minister of Justice on 20 August 1942,Schlegelberger received a letter of appreciation from Hitler togetherwith a gift of 100,000 RM.Later in 1944 Hitler gave Schlegelberger the special privilege touse the 100,000 RM to purchase a farm, which under the rule thenprevailing could have been purchased only by an expert agriculturist.Schlegelberger states that the 100,000 RM were on deposit in a BerlinGerman bank to his account when the collapse came. Thus, it is shownthat Hitler and Schlegelberger were not too objectionable to eachother. These transactions also show that Hitler was at least attemptingto reward Schlegelberger for good and faithful service rendered in theperformance of some of which Schlegelberger committed both war crimesand crimes against humanity as charged in the indictment.We have already adverted to his speech at the University of Rostock on10 March 1936, on the subject, A Nation Beholds Its Rightful Law. Inthis speech Schlegelberger declared:   In the sphere of criminal law the road to a creation of justice   in harmony with the moral concepts of the new Reich has been   opened up by a new wording of section 2 of the criminal code,   whereby a person is also (to) be punished even if his deed   is not punishable according to the law, but if he deserves   punishment in accordance with the basic concepts of criminal   law and the sound instincts of the people. This new definition   became necessary because of the rigidity of the norm in force   hitherto.As amended, section 2 remained in effect until repealed by Law No.11 of the Allied Control Council. The term the sound peoplessentiment as used in amended section 2 has been the subject of muchdiscussion and difference of view as to both its proper translationand interpretation. We regard the statute as furnishing no objectivestandards by which the peoples sound sentiment may be measured. Inapplication and in fact this expression became the healthy instinctsof Hitler and his coconspirators.What has been said with regard to the amendment to section 2 of thecriminal code is equally true of the amendment of section 170a of thecode by the decree of Hitler of 28 June 1935, which is also signed byMinister Guertner and which provides:   If an act deserves punishment according to the common sense   of the people but is not declared punishable in the code, the   prosecution must investigate whether the underlying principle of   a penal law can be applied to the act and whether justice can   be helped to triumph by the proper application of this penal   law.[666]This new conception of criminal law was a definite encroachment uponthe rights of the individual citizen because it subjected him to thearbitrary opinion of the judge as to what constituted an offense. Itdestroyed the feeling of legal security and created an atmosphere ofterrorism. This principle of treating crimes by analogy provided anexpedient instrumentality for the enforcement of Nazi principles inthe occupied countries. German criminal law was therefore introducedin the incorporated areas and also in the nonincorporated territories,and German criminal law was thereafter applied by German courts in thetrial of inhabitants of occupied countries though the inhabitants ofthose countries could have no possible conception of the acts whichwould constitute criminal offenses.In the earlier portions of this opinion we have repeatedly referred tothe actions of the defendant Schlegelberger. Repetition would serveno good purpose. By way of summary we may say that Schlegelbergersupported the pretension of Hitler in his assumption of power to dealwith life and death in disregard of even the pretense of judicialprocess. By his exhortations and directives, Schlegelberger contributedto the destruction of judicial independence. It was his signatureon the decree of 7 February 1942 which imposed upon the Ministry ofJustice and the courts the burden of the prosecution, trial, anddisposal of the victims of Hitlers Night and Fog. For this he must becharged with primary responsibility.He was guilty of instituting and supporting procedures for thewholesale persecution of Jews and Poles. Concerning Jews, his ideaswere less brutal than those of his associates, but they can scarcelybe called humane. When the final solution of the Jewish questionwas under discussion, the question arose as to the disposition ofhalf-Jews. The deportation of full Jews to the East was then in fullswing throughout Germany. Schlegelberger was unwilling to extend thesystem to half-Jews. He therefore proposed to Reich Minister Lammers,by secret letter on 5 April 1942 (_4055-PS, Pros. Ex. 401_):   The measures for the final solution of the Jewish question   should extend only to full Jews and descendants of mixed   marriages of the first degree, but should not apply to   descendants of mixed marriages of the second degree. [First   degree presumably those with two non-Aryan grandparents, and   second degree with only one.]   With regard to the treatment of Jewish descendants of mixed   marriages of the first degree, I agree with the conception of   the Reich Minister of the Interior which he expressed in his   letter of 16 February 1942, to the effect that the prevention   of propagation of these descendants of mixed marriages is to be   preferred to their being thrown in with the Jews and evacuated.   It follows therefrom that the evacuation of those half-Jews   who are no more capable of propagation is obviated from the   beginning. There is no national interest in dissolving the   marriages between such half-Jews and a full-blooded German.   Those half-Jews who are capable of propagation should be given   the choice to submit to sterilization or to be evacuated in the   same manner as Jews.Schlegelberger knew of the pending procedures for the evacuation ofJews and acquiesced in them. As to half-Jews his only suggestion wasthat they be given the free choice of either one of the impaling hornsof a dilemma. On 17 April 1941 Schlegelberger wrote to Lammers asfollows (_NG-144, Pros. Ex. 199_):   On being informed of the Fuehrers intention to discriminate   in the sphere of penal law between the Poles (and probably the   Jews as well), and the Germans, I prepared, after preliminary   discussions with the presidents of the courts of appeal and   the attorneys general of the annexed eastern territories, the   attached draft concerning the administration of the penal laws   against Poles and Jews in the annexed eastern territories and in   the territory of the former Free City of Danzig.The draft of a proposed ordinance concerning the administrationof justice regarding Poles and Jews in the Incorporated EasternTerritories was attached to his letter and is in evidence. Acomparison of its phraseology with the phraseology contained in thenotorious law against Poles and Jews of 4 December 1941 disclosesbeyond question that Schlegelbergers draft constituted the basison which, with certain modifications and changes, the law againstPoles and Jews was enacted. In this respect he was not only guilty ofparticipation in the racial persecution of Poles and Jews; he was alsoguilty of violation of the laws and customs of war by establishing thatlegislation in the occupied territories of the East. The extension ofthis type of law into occupied territories was in direct violationof the limitations imposed by the Hague Convention, which we havepreviously cited.It is of interest to note that on 31 January 1942 Schlegelbergerissued a decree providing that the provisions of the law against Polesand Jews will be equally applicable with the consent of the publicprosecutor to offenses committed before the decree came into force.We doubt if the defendant would contend that the extension of thisdiscriminatory and retroactive law into occupied territory was based onmilitary necessity.Schlegelberger divorced his inclinations from his conduct. Hedisapproved of the revision of sentences by the police, yet hepersonally ordered the murder of the Jew Luftgas on the request ofHitler, and assured the Fuehrer that he would, himself, take action ifthe Fuehrer would inform him of other sentences which were disapproved.Schlegelbergers attitude toward atrocities committed by the policemust be inferred from his conduct. A milking-hand, Bloedling, wassentenced to death in October 1940, and during the trial he insistedhis purported confession had been obtained as a result of beatingsimposed upon him by the police officer Klinzmann. A courageous judgetried Klinzmann and convicted him of brutality and sentenced him toa few months imprisonment. Himmler protested against the sentence ofKlinzmann and stated that he was going to take the action of theHauptwachtmeister of the police Klinzmann as an occasion to expressgratitude for his farsighted conduct which was only beneficial to thecommunity. He said further:   I must reward his action because otherwise the joy of serving   in the police would be destroyed by such verdicts. But finally   K. has to be rehabilitated in public because his being sentenced   by a court is known in public.On 10 December 1941 Schlegelberger wrote to the Chief of the ReichChancellery stating that he was unable to understand the sentencepassed against Klinzmann. We quote:   No sooner had the verdict passed on Klinzmann become known   here, orders were for this reason given to the effect that the   sentence in case of its validation should not be carried out   for the time being. Instead, reports concerning the granting of   a pardon should be made as soon as possible. In the meantime,   however, the sentence passed on Klinzmann became valid, by   decision of the Reich [Supreme] Court of 24 November 1941 which   abandoned the procedure of revision as apparently unfounded.   Taking into regard also the opinion you expressed on the   sentence, Sir, I now ordered the remission of the sentence and   of the costs of proceedings by way of pardon as well as the   striking out of the penalty note in the criminal records.On 24 December 1941 Schlegelberger wrote to Lammers that he had quashedthe proceedings. In February 1942 Himmler wrote expressing appreciationof the efforts in quashing the proceedings against Klinzmann and statedthat he had since promoted him to Meister of the municipal police.Schlegelberger presents an interesting defense, which is also claimedin some measure by most of the defendants. He asserts that theadministration of justice was under persistent assault by Himmler andother advocates of the police state. This is true. He contends thatif the functions of the administration of justice were usurped by thelawless forces under Hitler and Himmler, the last state of the nationwould be worse than the first. He feared that if he were to resign,a worse man would take his place. As the event proved, there is muchtruth in this also. Under Thierack the police did usurp the functionsof the administration of justice and murdered untold thousands of Jewsand political prisoners. Upon analysis this plausible claim of thedefense squares neither with the truth, logic, or the circumstances.The evidence conclusively shows that in order to maintain the Ministryof Justice in the good graces of Hitler and to prevent its utterdefeat by Himmlers police, Schlegelberger and the other defendantswho joined in this claim of justification took over the dirty workwhich the leaders of the State demanded, and employed the Ministryof Justice as a means for exterminating the Jewish and Polishpopulations, terrorizing the inhabitants of occupied countries, andwiping out political opposition at home. That their program of racialextermination under the guise of law failed to attain the proportionswhich were reached by the pogroms, deportations, and mass murders bythe police is cold comfort to the survivors of the judicial processand constitutes a poor excuse before this Tribunal. The prostitutionof a judicial system for the accomplishment of criminal ends involvesan element of evil to the State which is not found in frank atrocitieswhich do not sully judicial robes.Schlegelberger resigned. The cruelties of the system which he hadhelped to develop were too much for him, but he resigned too late.The damage was done. If the judiciary could slay their thousands, whycouldnt the police slay their tens of thousands? The consequenceswhich Schlegelberger feared were realized. The police, aided byThierack, prevailed. Schlegelberger had failed. His hesitant injusticesno longer satisfied the urgent demands of the hour. He retired underfire. In spite of all that he had done he still bore an unmeritedreputation as the last of the German jurists and so Hitler gavehim his blessing and 100,000 RM as a parting gift. We are under nomisapprehension. Schlegelberger is a tragic character. He loved thelife of an intellect, the work of the scholar. We believe that heloathed the evil that he did, but he sold that intellect and thatscholarship to Hitler for a mess of political pottage and for the vainhope of personal security. He is guilty under counts two and three ofthe indictment.                         _THE DEFENDANT KLEMM_Herbert Klemm, formerly State Secretary of the Reich Ministry ofJustice, was born in Leipzig on 15 May 1903. After normal schooling,he passed his first legal state examination in 1925, his second legalstate examination in 1929. From 1929 to 1933, he was court assessorof the prosecution authority of Dresden. From March 1933 to March1935 he was the personal Referent and adjutant of Thierack, Ministerof Justice, Saxony. In 1935, at the time of the centralization of theadministration of justice, he was transferred to the Reich Ministryof Justice where he remained until he was mobilized for war serviceon 23 June 1940. On 20 April 1939 he was promoted to the officeof Ministerialrat. In July of 1940 he was assigned to the ReichCommissioner for the Occupied Dutch Territories, upon the request ofthe Plenipotentiary for Occupied Dutch Territories. On 17 March 1941 hewas transferred to the staff of the deputy of the Fuehrer, which laterbecame the Party Chancellery, in Munich. He remained with the PartyChancellery until 4 January 1944, when he became state secretary of theReich Ministry of Justice under Thierack. He remained in this capacityuntil the surrender.Klemms Party connections were as follows: he applied for membership inthe NSDAP on 4 November 1930; his membership card, 405576, was received1 January 1931. On 30 June 1933 he joined the SA; the highest rankwhich he received in the SA was that of Oberfuehrer. When in Saxony hewas the legal advisor of the SA for Saxony and liaison officer betweenthe SA for Saxony and the Minister of Justice for Saxony. When he wastransferred to Berlin, he was the liaison officer between the ReichMinistry of Justice and the SA Chief of Staff for Germany and the legaladvisor to the Chief of Staff of the SA for Germany.He was a member of the National Socialist Jurists League from 1933.In September of 1944 he was appointed deputy chief of the NationalSocialist Jurists League by Thierack, who was at that time chief.He received the Bronze Party Service decoration in 1941 and the GoldenParty decoration, the latter being conferred by Bormann in 1943.During the time in which the defendant was in Saxony, he was a memberof the disciplinary court of the SA group which dealt with the purge ofthe SA in connection with the Roehm Putsch.A brief outline of the official activities of the defendant Klemm isas follows: after transfer to Berlin in 1935, the defendant dealt withacts against the State and Party and, later, the malicious acts law. Inthis field prosecution could be ordered only by the Ministry of Justicewith the permission of the office of the deputy of the Fuehrer, whichlater became the Party Chancellery.It was during this period that the following circular, dated Berlin, 18October 1937, and initialed by Klemm, was issued (_NG-310, Pros. Ex.33_):   1. Criminal procedures concerning more severe interrogations   by the Stapo will be dealt with centrally by Chief Prosecutor   Klemm. They are to be sent to the competent co-worker Prosecutor   Winkler.   2. As far as reports concerning executions when escaping from   concentration camps, etc., suicides in K.Z. arrive, they shall   continue to be dealt with by the specialist competent for   the respective subject. The general consultant for political   criminal matters, however, is to be informed of the reports.   They are to be submitted to him once.The practice of more severe interrogations, according to the testimonyof Lautz, caused much worry to those concerned with the administrationof justice. By the term more severe interrogations is meant thirddegree methods which Hitler authorized the police to use in casesconsidered important for the safety of the State.From July 1940 to March 1941, while Klemm was in Holland, he hadcharge of both civil and penal law. The penal section in Holland wasfor German citizens not in the army and Dutch who infringed on Germaninterests. He was also liaison officer between the commissioner generalfor the administration of justice and secretary of the Dutch Ministryof Justice at The Hague.During this period there were published in the official gazette forthe occupied Dutch territories, in the year 1944,[667] decrees ofthe Reich Commissioner of Occupied Dutch Territories, Seyss-Inquart,pertaining to the registry of Jewish property, the confiscation of sameunder certain circumstances, and for the transfer of Jewish propertyto an official in the nature of an administrator. During this time aletter was written by Tenkink, Secretary General of the Dutch Ministryof Justice, to the Reich Commissioner of Holland, which shows thedefendants signature, informing the commissioner of excesses committedagainst Jews in Holland.During this period letters dated 24 and 30 September 1940, markedSecret, and signed by the defendant, to the department forlegislation, Lange Vijverberg, with opinions and recommendations as tothe registration and confiscation of Jewish property in Holland, weretransmitted.A letter dated 24 September 1940 contains the following statement:   In my view it must be achieved with other means to eliminate   Jewish influence from such corporations. In the Reich, too,   it needed months of careful work to gradually extract Jewish   capital without disturbing the economy or to eliminate Jewish   influence altogether.The defendant Klemm was in the office of the deputy of the Fuehrerand Party Chancellery from March 1941 to January 1944. The PartyChancellery had to approve the drafts of decrees in connectionwith national laws and ordinances and also was charged with theresponsibility for the approval of high official appointments. TheParty Chancellery was formed from what had originally been the officeof the deputy of the Fuehrer under Hess. It was the instrument of theParty in matters of State and soon became virtually the instrument ofBormann.In the Party Chancellery Klemm was Chief of Group III-C. This group hadthe following functions, as stated by the defendant:   First, it had to deal with laws and drafts and decrees of the   Reich Ministry of Justice, unless for reasons of their subject   they were dealt with by another group, because that group   appeared to be competent. Secondly, penal matters based on the   law against malicious acts, as far as on the basis of legal   provisions the approval of the Chief of the Party Chancellery   was required for the prosecution. Thirdly, complaints from   Party offices or individuals against decision by the courts.   Fourth, complaints from the administration of justice against   interference by Party offices into pending trials. Fifth, to   observe especially civil and penal cases which concerned the   Party. Sixth, matters of legal reform, and seventh, expert   opinions in the field of the Party law.Among his activities, and in conference with officials from theMinistry of Justice, he made suggestions for strengthening the powersof the police.At another conference with officials from the Ministry of Justiceconcerning the political evaluations of persons in connection withlegal procedure, he represented the standpoint of the Party that Partyevaluations should be accepted by the courts.During the time that Klemm was Chief of Group III-C, the act providingfor the retroactive application of law concerning treason was enactedand applied to the annexed eastern territories. It was claimed by thedefendant that this was based upon a decision of Bormann.At this time legislation depriving the Jews of legal rights was alsocontemplated; drafts of the proposals made were dealt with, and theletter of 9 September 1942, prepared in Department III, was dispatched.Also as part of the activities of Group III-C under Klemm, the proposalof the defendant Schlegelberger regarding confirmation of sentencesof penal cases by the president of the district court of appeals wasdisposed of and the defendant claims he influenced Bormann to opposethis recommendation of the Ministry of Justice.During this period a circular entitled, The New Organization ofJustice, signed by Bormann, and which the defendant Klemm claims wasintended to free the Ministry of Justice from Party criticism, statesas follows:   Hereby is further required that you report to me all complaints   which you have to bring in matters of justice, so that I can   clear up the situation immediately by confidential negotiations   with the Reich Minister of Justice. Should it, after a   discussion with the Reich Minister of Justice, seem absolutely   necessary that a problem is brought to the Fuehrer, then this   will be taken care of by Reich Minister Dr. Lammers and myself.During this period Klemm wrote the Minister of Justice as follows:   Your letter of 5 August 1943 is agreed to. No objections are   raised to applying the German Criminal Code for Juveniles to   foreign juveniles, unless they are Jewish, Polish, or gypsies.   Regarding juvenile gypsies and those of mixed gypsy descent,   you are asked to see to it that, simultaneously with the coming   into force of the new law concerning Reich juveniles, a special   regulation will come into effect which will prevent the German   Criminal Code for Juveniles from applying to gypsies and those   of gypsy descent merely because a definite regulation is   lacking.The defendant states that during this period Bormann called him on thetelephone and inquired whether he knew Rothenberger and inquired aboutRothenberger. Also he later submitted to the defendant Klemm an inquiryas to the background and qualifications of persons presumed to havebeen possible appointees as Reich Minister of Justice. These includedThierack, and Klemm states that his report to Bormann was favorable toThierack. These inquiries were made of the defendant in spite of thefact that, according to his testimony, he had to deal only with matterspertaining to the administration of justice, and these were definitelypersonnel matters under another department of the Party Chancellery.During this period he was the liaison officer between Thierack and theParty Chancellery. As to this relationship, Klemm states:   Thierack asked me in all matters concerning the justice   group of the Party Chancellery to come to him, that is to him   personally, immediately and not to discuss them with the various   Referents at the Ministry * * * and as I had worked in both   fields, the best thing for him to get acquainted with the matter   would be if I reported to him in person.With reference to Klemms duties as Under Secretary of State, thefollowing paragraph of a report of the conference of the departmentchiefs, held 6 January 1944, outlines in part his duties in theMinistry as follows (_NG-195, Pros. Ex. 45_):   The Minister announced that from now on the Departments III,   IV, and V, too, would be placed under the control of the State   Secretary and hereby recalled the contrary regulation in office   routine, which was published on 27 August 1942, but added that   all death sentences must continue to be submitted to him. He   would request the State Secretary to be present when they were   submitted. Furthermore, all political and legal matters of   particular importance must be reported to him.Klemm maintains that his supervision of Departments III, IV, and V wasmerely on paper. However, the testimony of Hecker does not bear thisout as regards Department V, nor does the testimony of Eggensperger.During this period the decree against Poles and Jews was still beingenforced under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Justice insofar asany was left, outside the sphere of the Gestapo and the concentrationcamps.During this period the Ministry of Justice still dealt with Nacht undNebel cases. The defendant Klemm denies, in general, knowledge of NNprocedure. Fourteen exhibits have been introduced in this case showingtransactions concerning NN matters, subsequent to the time Klemm tookover the office of State Secretary. The defendant admits knowledge thatNacht und Nebel prisoners were transferred from Essen to Silesia. Headmits refusal of spiritual care for NN prisoners by foreign clergymen.He admits knowledge of a draft of a letter from Thierack to Bormannto the effect that NN women who were not to be executed should be soadvised. He admits denying clemency to eight NN prisoners when he wasacting as deputy for Thierack. In the remaining 123 cases, clemency wasdenied by Thierack when Klemm was presumably sitting in conference withhim.Among the fourteen documents enumerated above is a report from thedefendant von Ammon, initialed by Klemm, relative to a trip concerningNN matters. This report states (_NG-231, Pros. Ex. 332_):   The Military Commander in Chief, France, is grateful for the   evidence which the military courts in occupied French territory   receive as a result of the activity of the general legal   authorities concerned with the prosecution and trial of NN cases   in occupied French territory.Klemm explains this document by stating that he merely approved thetrip. With the above explanations, Klemms counsel stated:   These are the only documents which the prosecution has   submitted against you as far as NN cases are concerned.In view of the fact that Klemm was State Secretary when these matterswere disposed of and, nominally at least, charged with supervision ofDepartment IV where they were handled, this conclusion is not one whichthis Tribunal accepts.With regard to clemency during the time the defendant was StateSecretary, Klemm is shown to have dealt with clemency matters as theadvisor of Thierack when he was present and as his deputy in hisabsence. He states that personally he dealt only with clear cases and,further, that in clear cases clemency had been disapproved by sevenagencies before it became a clear case. He states that clear cases werelegally incontestable.His testimony that in clear cases seven agencies disapproved clemencyduring the period when he was State Secretary, does not conform to thetestimony of the defendant Lautz or with Exhibit 279 which Lautz cites.Lautz testimony on this point is as follows:   The examination of these clemency pleas for their correctness   was no longer possible for the prosecutions in the majority of   cases. The prosecutors now had to restrict themselves to adding   the pleas to their reports without changing them. The time limit   laid down in the decree was, as a rule, not adhered to because   the offices at the Peoples Court and the Reich prosecution were   so overburdened that it was impossible for them to submit the   files within the time limit set. Owing to that, occasionally   there was sufficient time to make further investigations in the   matter of the clemency plea. However, the opinion of the court,   the prison, and all other agencies was no longer heard. They had   been of importance before. (_Tr. p. 5947._)Moreover, what may constitute a legally incontestable case is subjectto considerable speculation. Presumably a case based upon a confessionwould be legally incontestable. Certainly it can hardly be assumed thatthe defendant Klemm was unaware of the practice of the Gestapo withregard to obtaining confessions. He had dealt with this matter duringhis early period with the department of justice. It is hardly crediblethat he believed that the police methods which at an earlier time weresubject to some scrutiny by the Ministry of Justice, had become lessharsh because the Gestapo, in October of 1940, was placed beyond thejurisdiction of law. He must have been aware that a prolific source ofclear cases based on confessions and, therefore, legally incontestable,came to him from the obscurity of the torture chamber.During the time Klemm was State Secretary, the plan of the leaders ofthe Nazi state to inspire the lynching of Allied fliers by the peopleof Germany was inaugurated, and during this period the matter ofexecution of approximately 800 political prisoners, prior to evacuationof the penitentiary at Sonnenburg, took place. These matters will bedealt with more fully hereafter.As heretofore pointed out in this opinion, the essential elements toprove a defendant guilty under the indictment in this case are thata defendant had knowledge of an offense charged in the indictmentand established by the evidence, and that he was connected with thecommission of that offense.As to the matter of knowledge of the defendant Klemm, aside from thesources of knowledge heretofore pointed out in this opinion in regardto all of the defendants herein, certain other facts are significant.The defendants sources of information were of a wide scope. He hadbeen the liaison officer between the administration of justice and theSA in Saxony and the legal advisor of the chief of the SA for Saxony.On transfer to Berlin, he acted in the same capacity with the SA mainoffice for the Third Reich and was the liaison officer between theMinistry of Justice and the SA Main office. In Holland he was head ofthe department of legal matters under Seyss-Inquart. He served with theOffice of the Deputy of the Fuehrer and Party Chancellery from March1941 to January 1944. There he was in charge of Group III-C. He wasthe friend of Klopfer in charge of Group III and, from the evidence,a trusted lieutenant of Bormann. Finally, he was State Secretary underThierack, whom he had known since he was his adjutant and personalReferent in Saxony. In Berlin he lived with Thierack for the period inwhich he was State Secretary.Klemms career under the Third Reich moved smoothly from comparativeinsignificance to the position of State Secretary in the Ministry ofJustice. His ascent was marked by no serious differences as to Partypolicies. He was close to both Bormann and Thierack and ascended bytheir favor. Under the circumstances it is not credible that he wasignorant of the policies and methods of these ruthless figures.The defendant lays great stress on an order of Hitler as to secrecyand states that in connection with this order he adhered strictly toit; that he did not attempt to hear anything outside of his officialduties. Such orders as to secrecy were not confined to Germany duringthe war; they were standard procedure in other countries and by nomeans excluded knowledge of secret matters derived from normal humancontacts, particularly friends and acquaintances in the higher levelsof state affairs. Further, the confidential position held by thedefendant gave him a wide scope as to secret matters within the sphereof his official duties. As State Secretary of the Ministry of Justiceand deputy of the minister in his absence, the defendants officialduties required knowledge of the higher spheres of State policy.More specifically, Klemm knew of abuses in concentration camps. He knewof the practice of severe interrogations. He knew of the persecutionand oppression of the Jews and Poles and gypsies. He must be assumedto have known, from the evidence, the general basis of Nacht und Nebelprocedure under the Department of Justice. Therefore, it becomesimportant to consider his connection with the carrying out of thesecrimes alleged in the indictment and established by the evidence inthis case.It is clear from the evidence, heretofore outlined in part, that whenthe defendant Klemm was in Holland he knew of the persecution of Jewsand he was connected to some extent with that persecution.While he was in the Party Chancellery he wrote the letter, heretoforepointed out, denying the application of the German juvenile law toPoles, Jews, and gypsies. This Tribunal does not construe that letteras a legal opinion but as an expression of Party policy, submittedthrough the Party Chancellery to the Ministry of Justice to the effectthat minors of the prescribed races must be subject to the mercilessprovisions of the decree against Poles and Jews. The argument thatthey were necessarily excluded because they were foreigners, andthat the German Juvenile Act contemplated entrance into the HitlerYouth, and similar provisions applicable only to Germans has littlesignificance when the letter itself expressly states that there wereno objections to applying the German Criminal Code for juveniles toforeign juveniles, unless they were Poles, Jews, or gypsies. Further,it can hardly be construed as a legal opinion as to gypsies in viewof the statement therein made that a special regulation will comeinto effect which will prevent the German Criminal Code for juvenilesfrom applying to gypsies and those of gypsy descent merely because adefinite regulation is lacking.While in the Party Chancellery, Klemm took part in drafting the law tomake treason retroactive and applying it to annexed territories, andthis draft bears his signature.As State Secretary he knew of the NN procedure and was connectedtherewith, particularly as to the approximately 123 NN prisonerssentenced to death who were denied clemency while he sat in conferencewith Thierack, and in the eight cases where he denied clemency asdeputy for Thierack.As State Secretary in the Ministry of Justice, he necessarily exercisedsupervision over the enforcement of the decree against Poles and Jewsand dealt with clemency matters pertaining to cases tried under thatdecree.In connection with the defendant Klemm, two other transactionsconstituting crimes charged in the indictment are of particularsignificance. The first of these is charged under the second countof the indictment as a war crime against all the defendants and,particularly under paragraph 18 of the indictment, charging thedefendant Klemm with special responsibility and participation. Thispertains to the inciting of the German population to murder Alliedairmen forced down within the Reich.Evidence of this plan of the leaders of the German State is found asfollows: First in the correspondence relative to the treatment ofso-called enemy terrorist airmen. As part of this correspondencefrom the deputy chief of the operations staff of the armed forces,entitled Secret matter, dated 6 June 1944, and signed by GeneralWarlimont,[668] the following sentence is significant:Lynch justice should be considered as being the rule. Further, adraft of a letter, dated Salzburg, 20 June 1944, to the Chief of theHigh Command of the Armed Forces, apparently drawn by the ForeignOffice, contains this paragraph:   The above considerations warrant the general conclusion that   the cases of lynching ought to be stressed in the course of   this action. If the action is carried out to such an extent * *   * the deterring of enemy airmen is actually achieved.In furtherance of this plan, Goebbels speech of 27 May 1944 is citedand the letter from the Chief of the Party Chancellery, FuehrerHeadquarters, 30 May 1944, marked Secret--not for publication, andbearing the initials of Thierack, concerning the peoples judgmentof Anglo-American murders, signed by Bormann, is significant,particularly the following paragraph:   No police or criminal proceedings have been taken against the   citizens who have taken part herein.The distribution of this circular was as follows: Reichsleiter,Gauleiter, Verbaendefuehrer, Kreisleiter,[669] and contains thefollowing note to all Gauleiter and Kreisleiter, initialed by Thierackand signed by Friedrichs:   The Chief of the Party Chancellery requests that the   Kreisleiter inform the Ortsgruppenleiter only verbally of the   contents of this circular.Exhibit 109 [635-PS, Pros. Ex. 109] is of even greater significance.This is a letter from the Reich Minister and chief of the ReichChancellery, dated 4 June 1944, to the Reich Minister of Justice, Dr.Thierack, headed, Regards peoples justice against Anglo-Americanmurders. This letter is quoted in its entirety:   The Chief of the Party Chancellery informed me about the   enclosed transcript of a secret circular letter and requested me   likewise to inform you.   I herewith comply with this and beg you to consider how far you   want to instruct the courts and district attorneys with it.   The Reich Leader and Chief of the German Police has, as I was   further told by executive leader Bormann, so instructed his   police leaders.It contains a handwritten note, initialed by Thierack as a signatureand also initialed by Klemm, which reads as follows:   Return note with the addition that such cases are to be   submitted to me for the purpose of their examination for   quashing in case proceedings are pending.In this adroit plan to encourage the murder of Allied airmen and escapethe responsibility, therefore, under the recognized rules of warfare,the procedures adopted by the Ministry of Justice were unique andworthy of the legal minds of those who dealt with the matter. As shownin the affidavit of Pejlovec, a secret directive was sent out by theMinistry of Justice calling for reports in cases of the lynching ofAllied airmen. This directive was interpreted by Pejlovec to the effectthat no prosecutions were contemplated.The witness Dr. Gustav Mitzschke, Referent in the legislativedepartment, testified that he was instructed to call upon the StateSecretary, which he did, and received the following instructions:   When you talk to General Public Prosecutor Helm at Munich,   please tell him that in cases where Allied fliers have been   killed or ill-treated, the police and any other agencies   concerned are to pass on the files to the prosecution office,   and that the prosecution as quickly as possible must make a   report to the minister and also forward the files.Helm issued a directive to the prosecutors under him. This directivecalled for reports and files in such cases and stated that they werenecessary because sometimes other factors, such as robbery or the useof Allied uniforms to cover the murder of Germans, had to be considered.Klemm stated that Mitzschke was directed to inform Helm that reportswere to be given in all cases.The witness Helm stated that the note in conformity with Mitzschkesinstructions as to the reports to be made was written and sentout, he thinks, on the same day of Mitzschkes visit and, in hiscross-examination he states that he is sure it was not later than theday after Mitzschkes visit.The witness Hans Hagemann, general public prosecutor at Duesseldorf,testified that he was directed that in such cases a report had to bemade to the Ministry of Justice. He also verified the secret decreesent out by the Minister of Justice.The nature of the reports called for, in itself, is not considered bythis Tribunal of particular importance. Thierack had directed Klemm,as shown above, to submit to him reports as to cases pending forquashing. The procedure followed by the Ministry went beyond this inthat it required reports and the transmittal of files of cases where noindictment had as yet been issued. The Ministry of Justice thus tookover, in substance, the disposition of these cases and the prosecutionthroughout Germany was thereby restricted in its normal duty of filingindictments against those who had murdered Allied airmen and werecriminals under German law. From the evidence in this case and fromsources of judicial information, this Tribunal knows of many instancesof the lynching of Allied airmen by the German population. No case hasbeen brought to the attention of this Tribunal where an indictmentwas actually filed for such offenses. What reports and files weresubmitted to the Ministry of Justice we do not know, but it is obviousthat such reports as were made were allowed to die in the archives ofthe Ministry.There is evidence as to one case pertaining to this matter. Thedefendant Klemm in his testimony refers to it. Around the turn of theyear 194445 in Kranenburg, in the district of the court of appeals,Duesseldorf, an SA leader had shot two captured paratroopers in coldblood. Regarding this, Klemm stated:   We prosecuted that case and even though the police, as well   as the Party offices, offered considerable resistance, these   discussions were advanced energetically. I do not know of the   final outcome.The evidence in this case, as shown by the testimony of Hagemann,indicates that during September of 1944, at the time of the Alliedparachute attack on Arnhem two captured Canadian paratroopers were shotby one Kluetgen while a Kreisleiter stood by and either permitted orencouraged the shooting.The witness Hagemann undertook to investigate the matter but was unableto do so fully because a Kreisleiter could not be so examined if herefused to testify. It was necessary if the Kreisleiter was to beexamined to have the approval of the Party Chancellery. An applicationwas made for such consent but it was never given. Hagemann stated thathe made a report over the telephone to the Ministry about the case.He believed he spoke with the defendant Mettgenberg. Afterwards hemade a written report to the Ministry of Justice. He told the Ministrythat he needed their support to obtain permission for the Kreisleiterto testify. He received written instructions to clear up the casecompletely, but since no approval was received to interrogate theKreisleiter, he could not continue the proceedings. He stated, thatagain and again he requested the Ministry to obtain permission forhim to examine the Kreisleiter. When asked whether he heard from theMinistry regarding this authority, he stated that he had not.Permission to examine the Kreisleiter not having been obtained, hewas never examined. Up to the time of the capitulation of Germany, noindictment had been filed against Kluetgen. This apparently was theprosecution and energetic action on the part of the Ministry of Justiceto which Klemm referred in his testimony. In many cases discussedbefore this Tribunal, indictment, trial, and final execution werecertainly more expeditiously handled.In this plan to incite the population to murder Allied airmen, thepart of the Ministry of Justice was, to some extent, a negative one.However, neither its action in calling for a report on pendingcases for quashing, nor its action in calling for reports and filespertaining to all such incidents, was negative. Certainly the neteffect of the procedure followed by the Ministry of Justice resulted inthe suppression of effective action in such cases, as was contemplatedin the letter from the Reich Ministry and Chief of the ReichChancellery to the Ministry of Justice.The defendant Klemm was familiar with the entire correspondence onthis matter. He specifically directed the witness Mitzschke to obtainreports. His own testimony shows that he knew of the failure to takeeffective action in the case cited, and it is the judgment of thisTribunal that he knowingly was connected with the part of the Ministryof Justice in the suppression of the punishment of those persons whoparticipated in the murder of Allied airmen.The second transaction of particular importance with regard to thedefendant Klemm is connected with the penitentiary at Sonnenburg. Therecord in this case shows that in the latter part of January 1945 thisgreat penal institution under the Ministry of Justice was evacuated andthat prior thereto, between seven and eight hundred political prisonerstherein were shot by the Gestapo.Klemm denies knowledge of this matter and states:   From the documents in this case only, particularly from the   affidavit of Leppin, I found out that over 800 persons were shot   at Sonnenburg.He testified further that about the middle of January, Thierack hadtold him that Himmler had subordinated the prisoners at Sonnenburgto his own command and that as Minister of Justice of the Reich he,Thierack, could no longer do anything in regard to this institution. Hetestified further:   It is not only my opinion but it was absolutely clear that at   that time that penal institution was exclusively under the order   of Himmler.He stated that he spoke to Hansen about the subject of Sonnenburgafter this conversation with Thierack as to the change in authority,and that Hansen knew about such change. He testified further that theprisoners were turned over to the Gestapo, I only found out here inthis courtroom.As to what occurred in the Ministry of Justice with regard to theevacuation of Sonnenburg, the testimony of Robert Hecker is important.Hecker was the Referent in the department of justice in Department V ofBerlin. Hecker testified in substance as follows: that in discussionswith Hansen, the general public prosecutor for the Kammergericht inBerlin and the official under the Ministry of Justice responsiblefor certain matters in penal institutions, Hansen told him it mightbe necessary to evacuate Sonnenburg and that preliminary discussionshad been carried on; that he, Hansen, had discussed the matter withthe State Secretary with regard to the measures to be taken, and hehad misgivings and suggested to Hecker that Hecker discuss the matterwith the State Secretary. Hecker further stated that when he was theofficial on duty one night for the Minister of Justice, he received atelephone call from the director at Sonnenburg to the effect that aRussian break-through had taken place and asking for instructions; thathe thereupon called Thierack at his home and asked for instructions andThierack stated that the institution would be defended, and that theauthorities at the institution were so informed. As the break-throughdid not then threaten the penitentiary, this order was not carriedout. Hecker testified that later the director of the prison asked whatmeasures he should take if the occasion should arise and that thereuponhe called the general public prosecutor at the Kammergericht as to whatinstructions had been issued. The general public prosecutor was away atthat time but the Referent who was present informed him that accordingto the instructions issued, the police were supposed to be informedin the case of evacuations. He testified further that Eggensperger, aReferent in Department V of the Ministry of Justice, who was on dutythe night of the evacuation of Sonnenburg, had informed him the nextmorning that the prison had been evacuated; that Eggensperger toldhim that Hansen had called the night before, stating that the actionof turning the prisoners not to be evacuated over to the Gestapo wasunder way and, when questioned as to whether it had been authorized bythe Ministry of Justice, Hansen had named Klemm as the person in theMinistry who knew of and approved the transaction. He stated furtherthat Eggensperger had made a typewritten note reporting his telephoneconversation with Hansen and that he had received a copy of the note.On cross-examination the witness Hecker testified in substance thathe was himself in charge of the problem of the evacuation of prisons.When asked if he had heard that Himmler, in the middle of January, hadissued an order concerning Sonnenburg, he answered that he had not andrepeatedly denied any knowledge to the effect that Himmler had takencharge at Sonnenburg, and stated that he had not heard any rumor in theMinistry of Justice to the effect that Thierack had given up authorityto issue orders concerning Sonnenburg. He stated that the conversationwith Thierack over the telephone was at night and that Thierack hadmerely answered briefly his inquiry, stating that the institution wouldbe defended. He testified that during the course of that night herepeatedly spoke to the authorities in Sonnenburg penitentiary and thathe tried to contact the competent person in the Kammergericht, namelyHansen, in regard to the matter. Hecker stated that the director ofthe penitentiary knew that some kind of an agreement with the Gestapoexisted and what he should do in the case of an evacuation, and thatthere were secret directives for evacuating penitentiaries and prisons.As to the note made by Eggensperger, he stated that it included astatement to the effect that the matter had been discussed between theGeneral Public Prosecutor and the State Secretary Klemm. When askedabout what happened to prisoners not evacuated, he replied that as faras I was informed, the prisoners were shot by the Gestapo.The testimony of Eggensperger in connection with the evacuation ofSonnenburg is also significant. Eggensperger testified that he was anofficial in the penal execution department of the Ministry of Justice;that he was the official on duty for the entire Ministry of Justice towhom telephone calls were channeled on the night that Hansen reportedthe evacuation of Sonnenburg. Hansen called him during the nightand informed him that during that night the prisoners of Sonnenburgpenitentiary would be handed over to the Gestapo; that a detachmentof the Gestapo had already arrived at Sonnenburg; and that the actionwas under way. Hansen told me that this evacuation, or rather thistransfer of the prisoners being carried out, was because the enemyconstituted an immediate danger to the prison. When asked whetherthis directive had been approved by anyone in the Ministry of Justice,Hansen answered, Yes. This matter has been discussed with the StateSecretary Klemm. He testified as to the note which he made reportingthe transaction, and that Hecker received a copy of this note. Hestated that he had been deeply impressed by the information which hehad received and asked Hecker if it was true that the State Secretaryknew anything about the matter and approved it, and when asked whatHecker said, he answered:   Hecker shrugged his shoulders. He looked at me and said, Well,   Hansen has-- Well, I can only give you the sense of what he   says, that Hansen has fooled this Under Secretary of State and   he has got around him, or he impressed him. I think he said,   Hansen has convinced the Under Secretary of State to approve   it.He further stated that when he asked Hansen whether the minister or theMinistry were familiar with the matter, he answered in the affirmativeand told him that the State Secretary knew about it and that he had putthis down in his file note.On cross-examination when asked if, as a liaison officer in Berlin inDepartment V, he reported repeatedly to the defendant Klemm in hiscapacity as State Secretary, he answered, Yes. When asked with whatmatters he was concerned, he answered, Again and again there werecurrent matters which had to be discussed with the State Secretary whowanted some information and some information I gave him myself. Insome complicated cases I asked the officials in charge to come in.The witness also testified that because of Klemms personality he,Eggensperger, was quite surprised at the action of Klemm and that waswhy he discussed the matter with Hecker in the morning. He testifiedfurther that it was his duty to make the file note as to the telephoneconversation which he had received; that that file note was, he wouldsay, about a half of a typewritten page. When asked if the file noteincluded the name Klemm in connection with the fact that Hansen hadreferred to him, he answered, Yes. When asked whether Hansen spokeabout an agreement, whether he used the word agreement, the witnessanswered that while he could not state the exact word used, that Hanseninformed him that the matter had been discussed and approved, andstated that Hansen reported to me the execution of a directive whichhad been issued. He further stated:   If you ask me concerning the execution, it was the report of a   general public prosecutor concerning an important occurrence in   a penitentiary. I would formulate it like that. It was his duty   to report this matter.When asked if the name Klemm was mentioned by Hansen because Hansen hadnoticed that the witness had some doubts, the witness answered:   I certainly didnt ask him whether the State Secretary had a   report on that matter. I certainly asked him that the minister   knew about it, and therefore, it was striking that he did not   refer to the minister himself but rather to Klemm.He further testified:   I was the only official, apart from Hecker, in Department V,   who had remained in Berlin, and in that capacity I maintained   contact between the Ministry--that is the RMJ--and the evacuated   divisions. If Hansen was given any instructions, then it was I   who passed them on to him. That brought about the fact that I   had frequent contact with him, particularly over the telephone.He stated further that he never heard of anybody being called toaccount for the action taken in connection with the massacre atSonnenburg.Pertaining to the question as to who had the authority to determinewhat prisoners were to be evacuated in case of evacuation and whatprisoners were to be turned over to the Gestapo for liquidation,[NG-030, Pros. Exhibit 290] is important.This exhibit includes the directive from the Reich Ministry of Justice,dated 5 February 1945, which is designated Secret, to the publicprosecutor in Linz, re: preparation for an evacuation of the penalinstitution within the district of Oberlandesgericht Graz. This lettershows enclosures. It states as follows:   In view of the proximity of the front line I have advised the   public prosecutor in Graz to make the necessary preparations   for possible evacuation of the penal institutions within his   jurisdiction, and I have decided that your district shall be the   reception center for these institutions. You are requested to   take any steps which may be necessary for their reception, as it   might [become urgent at any moment. You will also get in touch]   with the public prosecution in Graz and exchange all necessary   particulars with him for the settlement of questions concerning   you both. For details I refer to the enclosed directives. You   are requested to keep me informed of whatever steps you take.It also includes a directive from the Reich Ministry of Justicewith the file mark IV a 56/45 g, dated Berlin, 12 February 1945,marked Secret, and also contains the stamp of the Oberlandesgerichtpresident at Linz, Received 9 March 1945. It is designated,Relieving of the Penitentiaries. It shows enclosures as follows:Additional copies for the public prosecutor and all independent penalinstitutions. This directive states, among other things:   Foreigners can only be set free in full agreement with the   police authorities; otherwise they must be transferred to the   police.This directive is signed Thierack.The exhibit contains further a directive to the public prosecutors,Linz, and is in part as follows:    To the: Public Prosecutors, Linz.    The authorities in charge of the independent    administrative offices.    Judges in charge of the juvenile prisons in Ottenheim    [and Mattighofen].   For their knowledge and consideration. The circulars given in   the Reich ordinance of the Reich Ministers of Justice, dated 12   February, have been communicated as follows: * * *.This directive also contains a form to be used in connection with thedischarge of prisoners, designated: Supplement to: Reich Ordinance ofReich Ministers of Justice, dated 12 February 1945, with the file markIV a 56/45 g, and has the seal of Linz showing receipt.The exhibit also includes a directive of Evacuation of the JudicialExecutive Institutions Within the General Plan for the Evacuation ofThreatened Territories in the Reich. This is marked Secret and hasno heading, no date, and no signature (_NG-030, Pros. Ex. 290_).This states, in paragraph 1:   The evacuation of penal institutions lying within territories   threatened by enemy attack is a matter of concern for the   public prosecutors of the territories to be evacuated as well   as for those within the territories appointed for reception in   transit. This does not apply if the evacuation can be confined   to a change of locality within the Landesgericht itself. The   carrying out without friction of all measures of evacuation   therefore depends upon the close cooperation of the public   prosecutors concerned who must get in touch with each other on   all the particulars which are necessary for those measures.   The individual measures for evacuation must be left as far as   possible to the personal initiative of the public prosecutors   concerned, as only they possess the necessary knowledge of local   conditions and are able to bring about the required cooperation   with local administrative and Party offices. These directives   can only give an indication of what is to be done.From the import, a fair inference is that it was an enclosure to theoriginal letter of Thierack.Further along, the document states:   NN prisoners are not to be released under any circumstances.   They are to be rapidly transferred to territories which are not   in danger of enemy attack according to special orders.   Foreigners are to be released only if they had their residence   in the Reich for many years, if they are especially reliable and   fulfill all the requirements under (_h_).   Jews, Jewish persons of mixed race of the first degree, and   gypsies are not to be released.   For Polish subjects, who are protected personnel, a release may   be considered only if the requirements made under (_h_)   apply to them after the strictest investigation. The same   applies to people living in the Protectorate of Bohemia and   Moravia. Poles who have been sentenced to at least 1 year   internment in a disciplinary camp, may also be turned over   to the police, with an interruption, if necessary, in the   execution of their sentence. This can only be done if an   agreement is reached with the commander of the Security Police   and the SD.Under the heading of Carrying-out the evacuation is stated(_NG-030, Pros. Ex. 290_):   As soon as orders for evacuation are issued, the evacuation   has to be carried out in full accordance with the plans agreed   upon. In many cases, it is true, prevailing conditions will   necessitate deviations and improvisations. Should it become   impossible, for any reasons, to bring the prisoners back to the   extent agreed upon, those prisoners who are not outspokenly   asocial or hostile to the State, are to be released in good   time so that they will not fall into the hands of the enemy.   The elements mentioned before, however, must be turned over   to the police for their removal, and if this is not possible   they must be rendered harmless by shooting. All traces of the   extermination are to be carefully removed.Further documents in this exhibit, issued at Linz, show that byagreement and orders of the defense commissioner, orders were issuedby the prosecutor at Linz which appear to implement the precedingdocument. On 14 April 1945 the chief public prosecutor at Linz made anofficial report to the Reich Ministry of Justice showing steps which hehad taken.The significant directives of the Minister of Justice above quotedwere issued shortly after the incident at Sonnenburg and concernedthe disposition of prisoners in the penitentiaries of the Reich inareas threatened by the Allied advance. It is also significant thatthe defendant Klemm who denies all connection with or authority overthe penitentiary at Sonnenburg in late January 1945 subsequently on11 February 1945 ordered the evacuation of the prison at Bautzen,including the discharge of certain prisoners and the transfer of thosenot so discharged to Waldheim; and that around Easter of 1945 heordered the evacuation of the prison at Rothenfeld and instructed thematron as to the disposition of the prisoners.It is the contention of the defendant that Hansen was an unreliableperson who falsely used the name of the State Secretary. It is tobe noted, however, that the testimony does not show that Hansen wasundertaking to obtain from Eggensperger authority for some contemplatedaction under alleged authority from the State Secretary. Hansen calledEggensperger who was the official on duty at the Ministry of Justice tomake an official report of an action which was already under way andwhen questioned as to his authority, he cited the approval of the StateSecretary. His report was embodied in an official note as he couldassume it would be. This note stated that the action taken was basedupon the approval of the State Secretary. Surely Hansen, an officialunder the Minister of Justice, whatever his character might have been,would never have dared to use falsely an alleged authority by the StateSecretary to account for the liquidation of some 800 people and thenmake an official report that, according to all normal procedure, wouldcome directly into the hands of the State Secretary.This Tribunal is asked to believe that in the middle of January,Himmler took over the operations of the penitentiary at Sonnenburg andthat the first time that the State Secretary, the defendant Klemm,heard of the liquidation of those who were not evacuated was in thistrial. That Himmler controlled evacuations within the area of hiscommand was shown by evidence in this case and can be assumed from thenature of the evacuation. An evacuation is a matter of military concernsince it involves interference on the roads with military operationsand transport. The operational control of a penal institution is anentirely different matter. In the middle of January, Himmler was incommand of an army which was having considerable difficulty and he wasscarcely in a position to assume the functions and responsibilitiesin the Ministry of Justice as regards the operations of a penalinstitution. Certainly if he did so it is strange that Eggensperger,a Referent in Department V dealing with penal institutions, orHecker, also in Department V and in charge of evacuations of penalinstitutions, or the director of the institution at Sonnenburg, knewnothing about this transfer of authority some two weeks after it isalleged to have been made. It was also strange that Hansen, who isalleged to have known of this transfer of authority, would call theMinistry of Justice and make an official report as to the transactionon the night when it was under way and cite as his authority for hisconnection therewith the State Secretary. That the defendant Klemm knewnothing about the liquidation of some 800 people in this institutionuntil he learned it in this trial, overtaxes the credulity of thisTribunal. Even in Nazi Germany the evacuation of a penal institutionand the liquidation of 800 people could hardly have escaped theattention of the Minister of Justice himself or his State Secretarycharged with supervision of Department V which was competent for penalinstitutions. Exhibit 290, herein extensively quoted, shows that theoperations of penal institutions and the disposition of the inmatesremained a function of the Ministry of Justice, and it is the opinionof this Tribunal that the Ministry of Justice was, at the time of theevacuation of Sonnenburg, responsible for the turning over of theinmates to the Gestapo for liquidation, and that the defendant, Klemm,approved in substance, if not in detail, this transaction.When Rothenberger was ousted as State Secretary because he was notbrutal enough, it was Klemm who was chosen to carry on the Thierackprogram in closest cooperation with the heads of the Nazi conspiracy.Klemm was in the inner circle of the Nazi war criminals. He must sharewith his dead friend, Thierack, (with whom he had lived), and hismissing friend, Bormann, the responsibility, at a high policy level,for the crimes committed in the name of justice which fill the pagesof this record. We find no evidence warranting mitigation of hispunishment.Upon the evidence in this case it is the judgment of this Tribunalthat the defendant, Klemm, is guilty under counts two and three of theindictment.                     _THE DEFENDANT ROTHENBERGER_From his own sworn statements we derive the following informationconcerning the defendant Rothenberger. He joined the NSDAP on 1 May1933 for reasons of full conviction. From 1937 until 1942 he held theposition of Gau Rechtsamtleiter. He states: As such I also belongedto the Leadership Corps. Parenthetically, it should be stated thatthe organization within the Leadership Corps to which he belonged hasbeen declared criminal by the judgment of the first InternationalMilitary Tribunal, and that membership therein with knowledge ofits illegal activities is a punishable crime under C. C. Law 10. Weconsider the interesting fact of his membership in the Leadership Corpsno further, solely because defendant Rothenberger was not charged inthe indictment with membership in a criminal organization. He was aDienstleiter in the NSDAP during 1942 and 1943. From 1934 to 1942 hewas Gaufuehrer in the National Socialist Jurists League. In 1931 hebecame Landgerichtsdirektor, and in 1933 Justiz-Senator in Hamburg.From 1935 to 1942 he was president of the district court of appealsin Hamburg. In 1942 he was appointed Under Secretary in the Ministryof Justice under Thierack. He remained in that office until he leftthe Ministry in December 1943, after which he served as a notary inHamburg. Thus, it is established by his own evidence that while servingas president of the district court of appeals he was also activelyengaged as a Party official. Other evidence discloses the wide extentto which the interests and demands of the Ministry of Justice, theParty, the Gau Leadership, the SS, the SD, and the Gestapo affectedhis conduct in matters pertaining to the administration of justice.Rothenberger took over the Gau Leadership of the National SocialistLawyers League at the request of Gauleiter Kauffmann, who was therepresentative of German sovereignty in the Gau and who was, for allintents and purposes, a local dictator. As Gaufuehrer during the periodfollowing the seizure of power, Rothenberger had ample opportunity tolearn of the corruption which permeated the administration of justice.He testified:   It has been emphasized here time and again how during the   first period, after the revolution of 1933, every Kreisleiter   attempted to interfere in court proceedings; the Gestapo tried   to revise sentences, and it is known how the NSRB, the National   Socialist Jurists League, tried to gain influence with the   Gauleiter or the Reichsstatthalter in order to act against the   administration of justice.Concerning the dual capacity in which he served, he said:   On account of the identity, of course, between president of the   district court of appeals and Gaufuehrer, I was envied by all   other district courts of appeal because they continually had to   struggle against the Party while I was saved this struggle.In August 1939, on the eve of war, Rothenberger was in conference withofficials of the SS and expressed to them the wish to be able to fallback on the information apparatus of the SD, and offered to furnish tothe SD copies of such sentences as are significant on account of theirimportance for the carrying-out of the National Socialist ideas in thefield of the administration of justice. Rothenberger testified thatduring the first few years after the seizure of power, there was theusual system of SD informers in Hamburg. The unsatisfactory personnelin the SD was removed by Reichsstatthalter Kauffmann, and the defendantRothenberger nominated in their place individuals who, he said, werejudges and who I knew would never submit reports which were against theadministration of justice. He states also:   In the meantime, the directive had been sent down from the   Reich Ministry of Justice to the effect that the SD should be   considered and used as a source of information of the State by   agencies of the administration of justice.While he was president of the district court of appeals at Hamburg, andduring the war, this ardent advocate of judicial independence was notadverse to acting as the agent of Gauleiter Kauffmann. On 19 September1939 Kauffmann, as Reichsstatthalter and defense commissioner, issuedan order as follows:   The president of the Hanseatic Court of Appeals, Senator Dr.   Rothenberger, is acting on my order and is entitled to demand   information in matters concerning the special courts and to   inspect documents of every kind. All administrative offices as   well as the offices of the NSDAP are requested to assist him in   his work.On 26 September 1939 Rothenberger, as president of the Hanseatic Courtof Appeals, notified the Prosecutor General of Kauffmanns order andrequested that a copy of the indictment in all politically importantcases or cases which are of special interest to the public should besent to him. In a report to Schlegelberger of 11 May 1942 he spoke ofthe crushing effect of the Fuehrers speech of 26 April 1942 and ofthe feeling of consequent insecurity on the part of the judges, andsaid:   I have therefore assumed responsibility for each verdict which   the judges discuss with me before passing it.In the same report he states that on 6 May 1942 he made arrangementswith all senior police officers, senior SS, senior officers of thecriminal police, of the Secret State Police, and of the SD tothe effect that every complaint about juridical measures taken byjudges was to be referred to me before the police would take action(especially regarding execution of sentence).In June 1942 Rothenberger reported to the defendant Schlegelbergerthat he had made similar arrangements in Bremen with the Kreisleiter,president of the police, leader of the Secret State Police (Gestapo),and the leader of the SD. He reported to Schlegelberger:   In view of the present situation, I am intensifying the   internal direction and control of jurisdiction which I have   considered to be my main task since 1933.On 7 May 1942 Rothenberger issued an order in which he stated hisintention to inform himself prior to the proceedings on cases whichare of political significance or which involve the possibility of acertain conflict between formal law and the instinctive reactions ofthe people or National Socialist ideology. He directed that reportsbe submitted to him which must be in sufficient detail in order, as hesaid, to enable my deputy to judge the necessity of my intervention.By reference to his own words we have already set forth Rothenbergersexpressed convictions as to the duty of a judge as the vassal of theFuehrer to decide cases as the Fuehrer would decide. The conclusionwhich we are compelled to draw from a great mass of evidence is notthat Rothenberger objected to the exertion of influence upon the courtsby Hitler, the Party leaders, or the Gestapo, but that he wished thatinfluence to be channeled through him personally rather than directedin a more public way at each individual judge. On the one hand heestablished liaison with the Party officials and the police, and onthe other he organized the system of guidance of the judges who werehis subordinates in the Hamburg area. He testifies that he consideredthe system of conferences between judges and prosecutors before trial,during trial and sometimes after trial, but before the consultation ofthe judges, to be wrong, and states that he considered it more correct,in view of the situation, that such a discussion should take place along time before the trial and not between individual judges and theprosecutor, but on a higher level, namely, between the chiefs of theoffices, so that there would be no possibility to exert an influence onthe individual judge in any way. Concerning his dictatorial attitudetoward the other judges, Rothenberger testified: Of course, guidanceis guidance, and absolute and complete independence of the judge ispossible only in normal conditions of peace, and we did not have theseconditions after the Hitler speech.The guidance system instituted by the defendant Rothenberger was notlimited to conferences concerning pending cases of political importancebefore trial. We are convinced from the evidence that he used hisinfluence with the subordinate judges in his district to protect Partymembers who had been charged or convicted of crime, that on occasionshe severely criticized judges for decisions rendered against Partyofficials, and on at least one occasion was instrumental in having ajudge removed from his position because he had insisted upon proceedingwith a criminal case against a Party official.As further illustration of the character of control which was exercisedby Rothenberger over the other judges in his district, reference ismade to his letter of 7 May 1942 addressed to the judges in Hamburg andBremen in which he announced that a conference would be held for thediscussion of cases fixed for the following week. We quote (_NG-389,Pros. Ex. 76_):   A few cues to matters which will come up will be given, file   numbers quoted, and comments made in a few key words.He especially required of the judges that they report to him concerningpenal cases against Poles, Jews, and other foreigners, and penaland civil cases in which persons are involved who are State or Partyofficials, or NSDAP functionaries, or who hold some other eminentposition in public life.One will seek in vain for any simple, frank, or direct statement byRothenberger relative to any of the abuses of the Nazi system. His realattitude can only be extracted from the ambiguities of his evasivelanguage. We quote from the record of the report made by Rothenbergerto the judges on 27 January 1942 (_NG-1106, Pros. Ex. 462_):   With regard to the matter it had to be considered whether or   not any material claims made by the Jews could still be answered   in the affirmative. Concerning this question, it might, however,   be practical to maintain a certain reserve.In an early report to the Hamburg judges, Rothenberger discussed theopinion of the Ministry concerning the legal treatment of Jews. Hestated that the fact that a debtor in a civil case is a Jew should as arule be a reason for arresting him; that Jews may be heard as witnessesbut extreme caution is to be exercised in weighing their testimony.He requested that no verdict should be passed in Hamburg when acondemnation was exclusively based on the testimony of a Jew, and thatthe judges be advised accordingly.On 21 April 1943, as the result of a long period of inter-departmentaldiscussions, a conference of the state secretaries was held.Rothenberger was at the time State Secretary in the Ministry ofJustice and participated in the conference concerning the limitationof legal rights of Jews. Kaltenbrunner also participated. At thismeeting consideration was given to drafts of a decree which had longbeen under discussion. Modifications were agreed upon and the resultwas the promulgation of the infamous 13th regulation under the ReichCitizenship Law which provided that criminal actions committed by Jewsshall be punished by the police and that after the death of a Jew hisproperty shall be confiscated.We next consider Rothenbergers activity concerning the deprivation ofthe rights of Jews in civil litigation. In the report of 5 January 1942the defendant wrote:   The lower courts do not grant to Jews the right to participate   in court proceedings in _forma pauperis_. The district   court suspended such a decision in one case. The refusal to   grant this right of participation in court proceedings in   _forma pauperis_ is in accordance with todays legal   thinking. But since a direct legal basis is missing, the refusal   is unsuitable. We therefore think it urgently necessary that a   legal regulation or order is given on the basis of which the   rights of a pauper can be denied to a Jew. (_Pros. Ex. 373,   NG-392, document book 5-D, p. 331._)Notwithstanding his statement of 5 January to the effect that it wouldbe unsuitable to deprive Jews of this right without a legal regulation,we find that on 27 January 1942 the report of a conference shows thefollowing (_NG-1106, Pros. Ex. 462_):   The senator reported that the question of the poor law   concerning Jews has gained significance again. With the district   court there were two cases pending. He requested that contacts   with the district court and with the local court judges be made   at once so that a uniform line is followed to the effect that   the Jews be denied the benefits of the poor law. It would be   entirely out of the question that Jews be granted the benefits   of the poor law subsequent to the present development. This   would apply especially to Jews who had been evacuated, but in   his opinion also to those who had not been evacuated.About this time a report concerning the claim of the Jewish plaintiff,Israel Prenzlau, came to the attention of the defendant Rothenberger.The Jew sought the right to proceed in _forma pauperis_. Thereport on the case contains the following statement by a Gau economicadvisor, which is couched in the usual Nazi language of sinisterambiguity (_NG-589, Pros. Ex. 372_):   In reply to your inquiry I state my point of view in detail.   In a lawsuit between a German national and a Jew, I consider   the settling of a dispute by compromise settlement in court   inadmissible for political reasons. The German national,   as party in the lawsuit, pursuant to his clearly defined   conceptions of justice derived from his political schooling   since 1933, can expect that the court will decide the case by a   verdict, i.e., take a conclusive attitude toward the dispute in   hand. What is expected is a decision which was arrived at not   from purely legal points of view, as result of a legal train of   thought, but which is an expression to the way in which National   Socialist demands concerning the Jewish question are realized   by German administrators of justice. Evading this decision by a   compromise might mean encroaching upon the rights of a fellow   citizen in favor of a Jew. This kind of settlement would be in   contradiction to the sound sentiments of the people. I therefore   consider it inadmissible.The report shows that upon receipt of the opinion of the Gau economicadvisor, the defendants thereupon refused settlement with theplaintiff and now deny that they owe him anything. The court which hadjurisdiction of the Prenzlau case granted to the plaintiff the rightto proceed in _forma pauperis_. On 13 February 1942 having beforehim the report of the Gau economic advisor, the defendant Rothenbergerwrote to the president of the district court, Hamburg, as follows:   I do not intend to approach the economic advisor of the Gau   for the time being, seeing from the documents that the ultimate   beneficiary of the claim, the son of the plaintiff, emigrated   in the year 1938 and his property, therefore, surely being   confiscated. I fail to understand why the court granted _forma   pauperis_ rights to the assignee, a Jew, without first   consulting the authority for sequestration of property.A note dated 24 February shows that Rothenberger had issued a directiveto two judges of his district to the effect that every case involvingthe claim of the right of Jews to proceed in _forma pauperis_must first be submitted to him. On 5 March 1942 a directive was issuedfrom the Reich Ministry of Justice in substantial conformity with therecommendation of the defendant Rothenberger. It provided:   In future the granting of rights of _forma pauperis_ to   Jews can only come into consideration if the carrying-out of the   lawsuit is in the common interest, viz, in disputes concerning   family rights (divorce in cases of mixed marriages, establishing   the descent).After the enactment of the foregoing ordinance, and on 7 May 1942,a courageous president of the district court at Hamburg wrote toRothenberger stating that in his opinion the right of Jews to proceedin _forma pauperis_ would have to be granted. He added:   I am convinced that it is in the common interest that an Aryan   cannot evade without further ado a just claim against him merely   for the reason that the court denies the _forma pauperis_   right to Jews.Notwithstanding this protest, and on 22 May 1942, the defendantRothenberger, in reliance upon the ordinance which was based upon hisrecommendation, wrote to the president of the district court of Hamburgthat he considered it adequate that the _forma pauperis_ rightgranted to the plaintiff Prenzlau be canceled. Please have this takeninto consideration by the court in a form which you deem appropriate.The foregoing narrative takes on additional significance whensummarized. First, Rothenberger recommends to the Minister of Justicethat it is desirable to deny to Jews the right to proceed in _formapauperis_, but that such denial is inadmissible because there is nolaw to justify it. He recommends the passage of such a law. About 3weeks later, no law having been passed, he recommends that the judgestake a uniform line depriving the Jew of the right to proceed in_forma pauperis_. A specific case now arises in which the rightwas granted to a Jew, and the defendant Rothenberger receives veiledsuggestions from the Gau economic advisor to the effect that defendantsshould not be allowed to compromise a case brought against them by aJewish plaintiff because the court should decide against the Jew inany event on political grounds. Concerning this suggestion Rothenbergerventures no comment. The defendant in the Prenzlau case takes his cuefrom the advice of the economic advisor and denies liability; thecourt grants to the Jew the right to proceed in _forma pauperis_.Rothenberger criticizes this action, although the lower court hadacted in strict conformity with the law. In March the awaited lawexcluding the Jew from the benefit of the poor-law is passed. In May,Rothenberger overrules the protest of a judge and directs the cancelingof the order which was made by the lower court. This dictation by thedefendant Rothenberger to other courts and judges of his districtwas not done in the course of a legal appeal from the lower court tothe court over which he presided. It was done after the manner of adictator directing an administrative inferior how to proceed.Rothenberger not only participated in securing the enactment of adiscriminatory law against Jews; he enforced it when enacted and, inthe meantime, before its enactment, upon his own initiative he actedwithout authority of any law in denying to Jewish paupers the aid ofthe courts.It is true that the denial to Jews of the right to proceed in civillitigation without advancement of costs appears to be a small mattercompared to the extermination of Jews by the millions under otherprocedures. It is nevertheless a part of the government-organized planfor the persecution of the Jews, not only by murder and imprisonmentbut by depriving them of the means of livelihood and of equal rights inthe courts of law.The defendant Rothenberger testified that various judges reported tohim that they had heard rumors to the effect that everything was notquite all right in the concentration camps and that they wished toinspect one. Accordingly, Rothenberger and the other judges visited theconcentration camp at Neuengamme. He testified that they inquired aboutfood conditions, accommodations, and the methods of work, and spoke tosome inmates, and he asserts that they did not discover any abuses.This was in 1941. Again in 1942, according to his own testimony,the defendant visited Mauthausen concentration camp in company withKaltenbrunner, who was later in charge of all concentration campsin Germany and has since suffered death by hanging. At Mauthausenconcentration camp the defendant Rothenberger again inspectedinstallations, conferred with inmates, and inquired as to the cause ofdetention of the inmates with whom he had talked. He states that fromhis spot checks he could not find out that there was any case of asentence being corrected. Upon inquiry as to what the defendantmeant by the correction of sentences, he answered:   By correcting of a sentence we mean that when the court had   pronounced a sentence, for example, had condemned somebody to be   imprisoned for a term of 5 years--if the police now, after these   5 years had been served, if the police arrested this man and   put him into a concentration camp--this is only an example of a   correction. Or even if, and this is clearer, it happened that a   person was acquitted by a court, and in spite of that the police   put this man into a concentration camp. These are examples of   correction of sentences.The defendant stated that he did not observe and could not discoverany abuse at Mauthausen. In this connection the testimony of defensewitness Hartmann is of interest. Hartmann accompanied Dr. Rothenbergeron his visit to Mauthausen concentration camp. He testified that rumorswere current in Germany to the effect that conditions were not whatthey should be in the concentration camps. Hartmann testifies thatthey went about the camp freely and observed everything closely. Oncross-examination by the Tribunal, Hartmann testified as follows:[670]   Q. * * * When you visited Mauthausen concentration camp, you   knew, did you not, that the courts in the Ministry of Justice   never sentenced convicted criminals to a concentration camp? * *   *   A. Yes.   Q. Did Dr. Rothenberger know it?   A. Yes.   Q. Then you knew that these ten people that he talked with, and   the one or two that you talked with, were not there by reason of   any action on the part of the Ministry of Justice or the court,   but were there only by reason of action by the police or by the   Party, did you not?   A. Yes. That was preventive custody undertaken by the police.The witness Hartmann testified further:   Q. And they had already served their sentences as imposed by   court before they were taken into this custody of the police, is   that right?   A. Yes. That is how I see it.   Q. And at that time, these twelve people who had served their   sentences and had been taken over by the police--that met with   the approval of the defendant Dr. Rothenberger, as I understand   you?   A. Well [we] did not approve the concentration camp as an   institution altogether, but first of all we wanted to achieve   this--that it would no longer happen that a defendant was   acquitted and then after acquittal the Gestapo arrested (him) in   front of the courtroom. * * * In those cases, too, he did not   approve the fact that these people were in a concentration camp   because we were of the opinion that only the administration of   justice should decide these questions of criminal law and nobody   else. But according to the power conditions within the State, as   they happened to exist, our interest was first of all to remove   the worst evils.Upon redirect examination by counsel for the defendant Rothenberger,defense witness Hartmann testified as follows:   Q. Therefore, sometimes was the situation for you and Dr.   Rothenberger like this: that apparently you affirmed something   with a smiling face, something which as a human being you had to   disapprove of and reject?To this question the witness answered that Dr. Rothenberger forreasons of power politics had to accept the conditions though he didnot approve them. After his inspection of Mauthausen concentrationcamp, Dr. Rothenberger took no action whatsoever with regard to theinformation which he had received.It follows that the defendant Rothenberger, contrary to his sworntestimony, must have known that the inmates of the Mauthausenconcentration camp were there by reason of the correction ofsentences by the police, for the inmates were in the camp eitherwithout trial, or after acquittal, or after the expiration of theirterm of imprisonment.It must be borne in mind that this inspection by the defendantRothenberger was made at Mauthausen concentration camp, an institutionwhich will go down in history as a human slaughter house and was madein company with the man who became the chief butcher.We are compelled to conclude that Rothenberger was not candid inhis testimony and that in denying knowledge of the institution ofprotective custody in its relationship with the concentration campshe classified himself as either a dupe or a knave. Nor can we believethat his trips to the camps were merely for pleasure or for generaleducation. He also advised other judges to make like investigations.We concede that the concentration camps were not under the directjurisdiction of the Reich Minister of Justice, but are unable tobelieve that an Under Secretary in the Ministry, who makes an officialtour of inspection, is so feeble a person that he could not even raisehis voice against the evil of which he certainly knew.If the defendant Rothenberger disapproved of protective custody andthe consequent employment of concentration camps, it must be becauseof a change in heart concerning which we have had no evidence. On 13June 1941 Rothenberger wrote Secretary Freisler suggesting that manysmall cases were being tried by the Special Court and that this wasnot compatible with the importance of the court. He referred to minoroffenses which came under the public enemy decree, in which, however,protective custody will be requested by virtue of the offenders pastlife and his character. Again, he speaks of cases in which motion ismade for the offender to be taken into protective custody.On 5 January 1942 the defendant Rothenberger addressed a report onthe general situation in the Hamburg area to the Reich Minister ofJustice. From this document his attitude concerning the institutionof protective custody may be ascertained. Concerning the transfer tothe public prosecutors of the right to decide about the duration ofprotective custody, he said:   In a certain connection with this problem is the transfer to   the public prosecutors office of the right to decide about the   duration of the protective custody. I regret that it is obvious   that the courts are more cautious and reserved than they were   previously in regard to the order of protective custody, because   the duration of the protective custody is not any more within   their control. This attitude of the courts cannot be approved,   but it is psychologically understandable; I am afraid, that   the reform effected the opposite of the intended more vigorous   practice in regard to protective custody.In February 1939 the defendant Rothenberger and the Chief PublicProsecutor reported to the Hamburg judges upon a conference whichhad been held in Berlin. The record of the joint report in whichRothenberger participated is as follows (_NG-629, Pros. Ex. 28_):   A report was then made on the discussions on protective   custody. The ministry is of the opinion--also held here--that no   objection can be raised to protective custody as long as it is   purely protective, but that corrective measures, such as became   known in certain cases, must not become a habit.In conclusion, the evidence discloses a personality full ofcomplexities, contradictions, and inner conflict. He was kind tomany half-Jews, and occasionally publicly aided them, yet he wasinstrumental in denying them the rights to which every litigant isentitled. He fulminated publicly against the Schwarze Korps forattacking the courts, yet he reproached judges for administeringjustice against Party officials and unquestionably used his influencetoward achieving discriminatory action favorable to high Partyofficials and unfavorable to Poles and Jews. He wrote learnedly infavor of an independent judiciary, yet he ruled the judges of Hamburgwith an iron hand. He protested vehemently against the practice ofParty officials and Gestapo officers who interfered with the judges inpending cases, but he made arrangements with the Gestapo, the SS, andthe SD whereby they were to come to him with their political affairsand then he instituted preview and review of sentences with thejudges who were his inferiors. He thought concentration camps wrong butconcluded that they were not objectionable if third degree methods didnot become a habit.Rothenberger was not happy with his work in Berlin. In his farewellspeech on leaving Hamburg, he exuberantly exclaimed that he had beenan uncrowned king in Hamburg, but he would have us believe that hereceived a crown of thorns in Berlin. Soon he learned of the utterbrutality of the Nazi system and the cynical wickedness of Thierack andHimmler, whom he considered his personal enemies. He could not stomachwhat he saw, and they could not stomach him. The evidence satisfiesus that Rothenberger was deceived and abused by his superiors; thatevidence was framed against him; and that he was ultimately removed,in part at least, because he was not sufficiently brutal to satisfythe demands of the hour. He was retired to the apparently quiet lifeof a notary in Hamburg, but even then we find that he was receivingsome pay as an Under Secretary and was assisting Gauleiter Kauffmann inpolitical matters in that city.The defendant Rothenberger is guilty of taking a minor but consentingpart in the Night and Fog program. He aided and abetted in the programof racial persecution, and notwithstanding his many protestations tothe contrary he materially contributed toward the prostitution ofthe Ministry of Justice and the courts and their subordination tothe arbitrary will of Hitler, the Party minions, and the police. Heparticipated in the corruption and perversion of the judicial system.The defendant Rothenberger is guilty under counts two and three of theindictment.                         _THE DEFENDANT LAUTZ_The defendant Lautz from 20 September 1939 until the end of the warserved as Chief Public Prosecutor at the Peoples Court in Berlin.He joined the NSDAP in May 1933. During the period of his service thehigher officials under his supervision increased from 25 to about70. The office originally consisted of four departments which werelater increased to five to correspond with the number of senates ofthe Peoples Court. After the enlargement of the department therewere five public prosecutors and one senior public prosecutor in eachdepartment. The defendants Barnickel and Rothaug were among the seniorpublic prosecutors under the general supervision of the defendantLautz. The crimes with which his office dealt were those over whichthe Peoples Court had jurisdiction. Of particular interest here werethe prosecutions for undermining the German defensive strength, hightreason and treason, cases of attempted escape from the Reich by Polesand other foreigners, and NN cases.A great number of prosecutions were brought under the decree of 17August 1938 which provides that Whoever * * * openly seeks to paralyzeor undermine the will of the German people or an allied nation toself-assertion by bearing arms should be punished by death. Thiswas the law which effectively destroyed the right of free speech inGermany. The prosecutors office was required to handle approximately1,500 cases a month involving charges of this type. Under supervisionof the defendant Lautz all of these charges had to be examined andassigned for trial to the Peoples Court in serious cases, or to othercourts. In the cases which were assigned to the Peoples Court fortrial there was always the possibility that the death sentence wouldbe pronounced.The defendant Lautz instructed his subordinates that only those caseswere to be retained for trial before the Peoples Court in which it waspossible to assume full responsibility if the Peoples Court senatepronounces the death sentence.Lautz did not shirk responsibility for the acts of his deputies. Hetestified that the signature of his deputy meant, of course, that Iassumed responsibility for that matter.In connection with the work of his department it was the duty ofthe defendant Lautz to sign all indictments, all suspensions ofproceedings, and all reports to his superior, the Minister of Justice.This work assumed such proportions that it became necessary to delegateparts thereof to his subordinates, but the defendant Lautz requiredthat important matters be reported directly to him. In partialexplanation of his activities and motives in connection with hisenforcement of the law against undermining the military efficiency ofthe nation, Lautz stated:   Just as I think it is a good thing that no one today can claim   that this war was lost only through treason, I must also say   that I regret that because of this war and through these death   sentences many people, who were otherwise all right, had to lose   their lives.As an illustration of the type of case which was prosecuted under thislaw, we cite the case of the defendant who said to a woman: Dont youknow that a woman who takes on work sends another German soldier to hisdeath? This offense was described by Lautz and Rothaug as a seriouscase of undermining the military efficiency of the nation. The officeof the Chief Public Prosecutor of the Peoples Court was vested witha wide discretion in connection with the assignment of cases to thevarious courts for trial. It will be recalled that the malicious actslaw of 20 December 1934 provided for punishment of persons who madefalse or treacherous statements fit to injure the welfare or prestigeof the government and of the Reich, etc. Under this law moderatepunishments by imprisonment were authorized, whereas, under the lawagainst undermining the defensive strength of the nation, the deathpenalty was mandatory. If the prosecutor sent the case for trial to thePeoples Court on the charge of undermining, instead of sending it to alower court for trial under the malicious acts law, he determined forall practical purposes the character of the punishment to be inflicted,and yet the evidence satisfies us that there was no rule by which thecases were classified and that the fate of the victims depended merelyon the opinion of the prosecutor as to the seriousness of the wordsspoken.The connection of the defendant Lautz with the illegal Nacht und Nebelprocedure is established beyond question. The Peoples Court acquiredjurisdiction of NN cases under the decree of the Reich Minister ofJustice of 14 October 1942. Lautz estimated that the total number ofNN cases examined by his department was approximately one thousand, ofwhich about two hundred were assigned to the Peoples Court for trial,but he added that each case could concern several defendants. No goodpurpose will be served by a second review of the testimony concerningthe Nacht und Nebel decree. In harmony with the decision in the case ofthe United States [et al.] _vs._ Goering, et al., this Tribunalfinds that the secret procedure which was instituted and enforcedthrough the Ministry of Justice constituted a war crime and a crimeagainst humanity. The Chief Public Prosecutor of the Peoples Courtzealously enforced the provisions of this decree, and his conduct in sodoing violated the laws and customs of war and the provisions of C. C.Law 10._Treason Cases Involving Border Crossings by Poles_Lautz estimated that from 150 to 200 persons were prosecuted forleaving their places of work and attempting to escape from Germany bycrossing the border into Switzerland. These cases were prosecuted underthe provisions of penal code concerning treason and high treason.On 24 February 1942 an indictment against the Pole Ledwon was filedby Parrisius as deputy for the defendant Lautz. The indictment wasmarked Secret Treason Case, and bore the stamp of the Chief PublicProsecutor at the Peoples Court. A letter signed by Lautz bearingthe same date was addressed to the presidents of the Second Senate ofthe Peoples Court and advises them that he is sending to the courtthe indictment in the case Ledwon. The indictment alleges that on 28July 1941 the accused left his place of work in Bavaria and attemptedto escape by crossing the Reich border, and that he was stopped bya customs official whom he struck with his fist while evading thearrest. The indictment states that the reason given by the defendantLedwon for his attempt to escape from Germany does not deservecredence; it may rather be assumed that he intended to join the PolishLegion organized on the side of the hostile powers. The indictmentstates that the defendant knew that the aim of the Polish Legion wasto restore a Polish state. On the basis of the foregoing specificallegations, the indictment charges that the defendant preparedwithin Germany (1) the highly treasonable enterprise to separatefrom the Reich by force a territory belonging to the Reich; (2) tohave aided and abetted the enemy inside Germany during a war againstthe Reich, and thus, as a Pole, not to have behaved according to theGerman laws and to the directives of the German authorities; and (3)to have committed a violent attempt on a German official. * * *. Theindictment was brought under the provisions of sections 80, 83, and91b of the penal code, and under the provisions of the law againstPoles and Jews. Section 80 provides for the imposition of the deathpenalty upon anyone attempting by violence or threat of violence todetach from the Reich territory belonging to the Reich. Section 83provides for the punishment of any person who solicits and incites anundertaking of high treason. Section 91b provides for imprisonment ordeath for any person who undertakes acts in favor of the enemy powersor causes a detriment against the armed forces of the Reich. On 10August 1942 the case was tried. The court found the following facts:defendant was a Pole who lived in Poland on 1 September 1939. (See:Law against Poles and Jews.) After the Polish campaign the defendantreported voluntarily for work in Germany and then tried to leave thecountry. The court states further that the prosecution charges thedefendant with the intention of going to Switzerland in order to jointhe Polish Legion there. It adds that the Polish Legion was internedin Switzerland and that many Poles had been caught at the frontier,some of whom could be convicted of planning to join the Polish Legionin Switzerland. The court, with unwanted candor, states that thetrial did not show any concrete evidence that the defendant * * * hadany knowledge of a Polish Legion in Switzerland. It held that due tolack of evidence the defendant could not be convicted of the crimeof preparation for treason and of treasonably aiding the enemy. Theopinion of the Peoples Court continues (_NG-355, Pros. Ex. 128_):   The defendant is, however, guilty according to the result of   the trial, of an offense under the ordinance relating to the   administration of penal law for Poles, of 4 December 1941. The   general conditions of this ordinance are fulfilled, as the   defendant is, by origin, education, and sentiment, a racial Pole   and was on 1 September 1939 resident in the former Polish State.   In leaving his place of work as an agricultural laborer, of   his own accord, at the end of July, i. e., during the harvest,   he disturbed the orderly procedure of the harvest work of his   employer to the detriment of the harvest. His action moreover   was detrimental to the whole of the German people, for in   leaving his place of work in order to go abroad he deprived the   German people forever of his labor. Germany, in order to cover   her war needs and to ensure food supplies for the front as well   as for home, however, needs all persons employed, including   foreigners. Every worker who by escape abroad deprives the   German war economy for good of his labor, reduces the number of   badly needed manpower, and thus endangers the interest of the   German people.The court held that it was irrelevant whether the Pole knocked thecustoms official down, because in any event he used force sufficient toprevent his arrest at the time. It observed that under the law againstPoles and Jews the only possible penalty is the death sentence, unlessa less serious case can be made out in the defendants favor. Thesenate was not able to recognize such case.The opinion concludes as follows:   But by using violence against the customs officer who was going   to arrest him and thus resisting the legal German authority,   he has proved himself such a fanatical and violent Pole that   he has forfeited any right for leniency. In view of the heavy   responsibility of the Polish nation for the bloodshed caused   during the weeks of August and September 1939, it is the duty of   every member of this nation to obey willingly the rules of the   German authorities. A Pole who, on the contrary, uses violence   against a German official can only be punished sufficiently by   the highest degree of punishment. Accordingly, this has been   imposed on the defendant.The Pole was sentenced to death.We are not here to retry the case. We may, therefore, ignore theridiculous charge that the defendant desired to join an interned legionand the allegation that he came to the Reich voluntarily after theinvasion of Poland. We have already discussed the essential evil in thepractice of prosecutors whereby they charged that Poles were guilty ofhigh treason by attempting to separate from the Reich territory whichhad never been legally annexed to the Reich. In the Ledwon case thesinister subtlety of the Nazi procedure is laid bare. If the case hadbeen brought only under the law against Poles and Jews, the PeoplesCourt would not have had jurisdiction, so the defendant was chargedwith high treason for attempting to separate from the Reich, territorywhich did not belong to it. The proof of high treason failed. Thereremained only the charge that in attempting to escape from Germany andfrom forced labor there, the defendant assaulted a customs officer withhis fist and that what he did was done as a Pole in violation of thelaw against Poles and Jews. It was under that discriminatory law thatLedwon was sentenced to death and executed. The defendant Lautz isguilty of participating in the national program of racial exterminationof Poles by means of the perversion of the law of high treason.In a similar case, upon an indictment signed by Parrisius and filed byauthority of the defendant Lautz, the Peoples Court sentenced threePoles to death upon a charge of preparation of high treason becausethey, as Poles, harmed the welfare of the German people, and becausein a treasonable way they helped the enemy and also prepared for hightreason. The specific facts found by the court were that the defendantMazur and others attempted to cross the border into Switzerland for thepurpose of joining the Polish Legion. By such conduct and by deprivingthe German Reich of the benefit of their labor, it was held that theefforts of the defendants aimed at forcibly detaching the easternregions incorporated in the Reich * * * from the German Reich. Theopinion contains an illuminating passage concerning treason committedby attempting to join an interned legion. We quote (_NG-352, Pros.Ex. 129_):   After the defeat of France in the present war, as is known   to the senate (court) from other proceedings, detachments of   the Polish Legion crossed the border into Switzerland and were   interned in camps. The legion continues under the command of   Polish officers and is kept in readiness for military action   against the Reich on the side of the enemy in the event of   German troops invading Switzerland.The evidence of intent to join the interned legion is paltry, but asbefore we will not attempt to retry the case on the facts. The courtheld that according to the law against Poles, the death sentence mustbe imposed. We quote:   They wanted to deprive the German nation forever of their   labor. Thus, they have damaged the welfare of the German nation.   This is an offense under the ordinance on the administration of   penal law against Poles. * * *   The precept of the Regulation of Penal law against Poles   applies to the defendants offense, although it was committed   before the regulation came into force for, according to article   I of the Supplementary Regulation of 31 January 1942, the   Regulation of Penal Law against Poles can be applied to offenses   committed before the regulation was in force with the approval   of the prosecutor. This approval has been given by the Reich   Chief Prosecutor.In another, the Kalicki case, the record of which is marked Secret,three Poles were sentenced to death for preparation of high treasonupon the same grounds as in the previous case. The court held that thesentence to be pronounced has to be based on the ordinance concerningthe administration of penal law against Poles, since this ordinanceprovides the heaviest penalty of all laws applicable to the case. Theevidence does not disclose that the defendant Lautz personally signedthe indictment, but it was certainly filed under his authority. Thequestion of clemency in the Kalicki case was presented to the defendantRothenberger. On 28 July 1943 he wrote:    * * * I have decided upon authorization by the Fuehrer not to   exercise my right of pardon but to let justice take its course.The defendant Lautz filed an indictment against the Pole, Bratek. Thespecific charge was leaving his work in Germany and attempting to crossthe border into Switzerland to join the Polish Legion. The generalcharge was the treasonable attempt to separate from the Reich an areabelonging to the Reich and the violation of the law against Poles andJews. The court said (_NG-595, Pros. Ex. 136_):   At the same time he has made himself guilty of a crime   according to Article I, paragraph 3, last half sentence, of   the Ordinance on the Administration of Penal Law Against   Poles, issued 4 December 1941. Because, being a Pole, he has   intentionally inflicted damage to the interests of the German   people by malevolently leaving his important agricultural   job, above all during harvest time, in September 1942, and by   planning to rob the German people forever of his own labor by   escaping abroad. * * *   According to article 73, Penal Code, the penalty must be based   on the ordinance concerning the administration of penal law   against Poles which _loc. cit._ demands exclusively the   death penalty as a rule, this being the most severe penal law   applicable here.A secret communication by the defendant Lautz to the Reich Minister ofJustice is of especial interest. The proposal under consideration asfor the prosecution of certain Poles upon the charge of high treasonon account of acts done in Poland before the war. In his discussionLautz quotes from Himmler, the Foreign Office, and the president ofthe Peoples Court. The facts on the basis of which opinions wereexpressed may be illustrated thus: Within Poland and before the war, aPole institutes proceedings against a Polish citizen of German blood,charging the racial German with fifth column activities directedagainst Poland. During the war the Pole who instituted the prosecutionagainst the racial German is captured. The question was: Can the Polebe prosecuted in a German court on a charge of high treason againstthe Reich, basing the charge on the fact that he had prosecuted theracial German in Poland? The German penal statute involved was section91, paragraph 2, which provides that whoever with the intention ofcausing a serious detriment to a national of the Reich, enters intorelations as described in paragraph I shall be punished, in especiallyserious cases by death. Himmler, as quoted by Lautz, discusses thebasis for punishment by German courts of an offender who has causedracial Germans to be punished or otherwise prosecuted by Polishauthorities. Himmler asserts that foreign police used methods againstracial Germans which were contrary to international law and the lawsof minorities and that such offenders deserve heavy punishment, buthe also states that as far as racial Germans are concerned, section91, paragraph 2, of the German Penal Code is not directly applicable,as racial Germans, according to formal national laws were not German,but Polish, citizens. I can only express my opinion in the form of asuggestion, that in case of the betrayal of a racial German by theforeign Poles * * * section 91, paragraph 2, of the German Penal Codeis to be applied * * *. (Citing decisions of the Peoples Court.)Himmler directly states that the provisions of section 91, paragraph2, are nonapplicable. We emphasize the fact that the question underdiscussion related to the proposed prosecution of a Pole for actscommitted before the war while Poland was in the exercise of itssovereign powers throughout its territory. The question could not wellhave related to acts done after Poland had been overrun and part ofit purportedly annexed, for, at that time Polish authorities wouldhave been in no position to prosecute racial Germans. Furthermore, indiscussing the problem, Lautz mentions a case against the Pole Golekwhich had recently come into his hands on preliminary proceedings. Hestates that Golek in the years 1938 and 1939 in Poland had turned overto the police authorities a racial German of Polish nationality and hadaccused him of high treason committed in favor of the Reich.Himmler, as quoted by Lautz, expressed the view that considerations offoreign policy would be opposed to the enactment of any German statuteunder which a Pole could be prosecuted by German authorities on accountof acts of the kind indicated, but he added:   I see here a task for the courts, an opportunity to fill a   gap in the law, a gap caused by political reasons of state by   creating a law in the appropriate cases.Himmler quoted from an opinion by the Peoples Court in which it wassaid that the National Socialist State feels it incumbent on itself,even in case of a conspiracy by a foreign government against onesingle Reich citizen, to give the threatened person its protection inaccordance with penal law as far as this is possible from the homecountry. It will be observed that this quotation relates to theprotection of Reich citizens, not Polish citizens, who are only racialGermans. Himmler continued, however:   The Reich made no secret of the fact that with regard to the   protection of Germans, it does not only claim the right to   protect Reich Germans but also racial Germans living on its   borders.The defendant Lautz frankly expressed the view that the German statutedefining treason did not cover the case under discussion. In this hewas clearly correct. The German statute on treason had been extendedto provide that whoever with the intention of causing * * * anyother serious detriment to the Reich, establishes relations with aforeign government, shall be punished by death. This section wasnot applicable to the case under discussion because the charge to bepreferred against the Pole was one of treason against an individualand not against the Reich. By the law of 24 April 1934 the concept oftreason was also expanded to cover certain cases of causing seriousdetriment to a German national, but that law also was inapplicable tothe case under discussion because the serious detriment had not beencaused to a German national but only to a racial German. Insofar as theGerman statutes required punishment of acts done with the intention ofcausing serious detriment to a national of the Reich, they extendedthe concept of treason in a manner unknown to the criminal law of anycivilized state, and this law was made applicable in occupied andpurportedly annexed territory. Notwithstanding the extremes to whichthe German laws of treason were extended, the defendant Lautz statedthat he agreed with the Reich Leader SS and the president of thePeoples Court that a direct application of the German law of treasonprotects only German nationals and does not apply to racial Germans. Hethen stated:   Furthermore, I concur with the conception that the general   political development which has meanwhile come about,   particularly during the last years, which has enabled the Reich   largely to protect its racial members of foreign nationality to   a greater extent than it has been possible hitherto, must be   borne in mind in this particular instance. Therefore, I find   it necessary, on principle, to protect by means of the German   penal code those racial Germans who have seriously suffered   through action such as mentioned in paragraph 92, subparagraph   2, of the Penal Code, provided that action deserves punishment   in accordance with sound German sentiment, but where such   punishment, considering the elements of wrongdoing of that   particular case, cannot be brought home on the strength of any   other directly applicable penal regulation.In conclusion the defendant Lautz stated that in the majority of caseswhich have been committed by foreign nationals abroad against racialGermans he would have to report in each individual case.Stated in plain language, Lautz proposed that the courts should tryand convict Poles for acts which violated no statute of any kind, ifthey deserved punishment according to sound German sentiment. Thisproposal violates every concept of justice and fair play whereverenforced, but when applied against a Pole for an act done in his owncountry in time of peace, the proposition becomes a monument to Naziarrogance and criminality. Such a Pole owed no duty of loyalty to anystate except Poland and was subject to the criminal jurisdiction of nostate but Poland. The prosecution of the Pole Golek would constitutea palpable violation of the laws of war (see: citations to the HagueConvention, _supra_), and any official participating in such aproceeding would be guilty of a war crime under C. C. Law 10. Thedocument discloses that cases similar to that of Golek had been triedby the Peoples Court and that more prosecutions were expected in thefuture. As a witness, the defendant Lautz testified that in severalindividual cases a decision had to be obtained from the minister. Weare justified in believing that Lautz expectations were fulfilled andthat he participated in the prosecution of Golek and in similar cases.We have cited a few cases which are typical of the activities ofthe prosecution before the Peoples Court in innumerable cases. Thecaptured documents which are in evidence establish that the defendantLautz was criminally implicated in enforcing the law against Poles andJews which we deem to be a part of the established governmental planfor the extermination of those races. He was an accessory to, and tooka consenting part in, the crime of genocide.He is likewise guilty of a violation of the laws and customs of warin connection with prosecutions under the Nacht und Nebel decree, andhe participated in the perversion of the laws relating to treason andhigh treason under which Poles guilty of petty offenses were executed.The proof of his guilt is not, however, dependent solely on captureddocuments or the testimony of prosecution witnesses. He is convicted onthe basis of his own sworn statements. Defendant is entitled to respectfor his honesty, but we cannot disregard his incriminating admissionsmerely because we respect him for making them.There is much to be said in mitigation of punishment. Lautz was notactive in Party matters. He resisted all efforts of Party officials toinfluence his conduct but yielded to influence and guidance from Hitlerthrough the Reich Ministry of Justice, believing that to be requiredunder German law. He was a stern man and a relentless prosecutor, butit may be said in his favor that if German law were a defense, which itis not, many of his acts would be excusable.We find the defendant Lautz guilty as charged upon counts two and threeof the indictment.                      _THE DEFENDANT METTGENBERG_By his own sworn statement the defendant Wolfgang Mettgenberg franklyand fully admits his connection with the Hitler Night and Fog decree.His statements show that he exercised wide discretion and had extensiveauthority over the entire plan from the time the Night and Fog prisonerwas arrested in occupied territory and continuously after his transferto Germany, his trial, and execution or imprisonment.We will not reiterate the statements made by him in his sworn statementand hereinabove quoted. Suffice it to say that Mettgenberg held theposition of Ministerialdirigent in Departments III and IV of the ReichMinistry of Justice. In Department III, for penal legislation, he dealtwith international law, formulating secret, general, and circulardirectives. He was regarded as an eminent authority on internationallaw. He handled Night and Fog cases and knew the purpose and procedurein such cases. He knew that the decree was based upon the Fuehrersorder of 7 December 1941 to the OKW. He knew that an agreementexisted between the Gestapo, the Reich Ministry of Justice, the PartyChancellery, and the OKW with respect to the purposes of the Night andFog decree and the manner in which such matters were to be handled.The defendant von Ammon was Ministerial Councillor in Mettgenbergssubdivision and was in charge of the Night and Fog section as shown inthis judgment. The two acted together on doubtful matters and referreddifficult questions to competent officials in the Reich Ministry ofJustice and the Party Chancellery, since both of these offices had togive their agreement in cases of malicious attacks upon the Reichor Nazi Party or in the Night and Fog cases. The NN cases came fromthe Wehrmacht but in some cases directly from the Gestapo. These caseswere assigned to Special Courts at several places in Germany and tothe Peoples Court at Berlin by defendant von Ammon. Mettgenberg andvon Ammon were sent to the Netherlands occupied territory becausesome German courts set up there were receiving Night and Fog cases inviolation of the decree that they should be transferred to Germany.They held a conference at The Hague with the highest military justiceauthority and the heads of the German courts in the Netherlands, whichresulted in a reference of the matter to the OKW at Berlin which agreedwith Mettgenberg and von Ammon that the same procedure should be usedin the Netherlands as in other occupied territories, that is, that allNight and Fog matters should be transferred to Germany.In Department IV for penal administration, Mettgenbergs work consistedof inspecting execution equipment. He witnessed one execution in1944. He was entrusted with speeding up clemency applications becauseprisoners were escaping during air raids. Reich Minister Thierackcalled the defendant, Rothenberger, Under State Secretary, by telephoneat Berlin and instructed him to make decisions concerning the clemencyin death sentence cases presented by defendant Mettgenberg who madereports lasting hours, and then Rothenberger made the decisions.The evidence does not positively show that clemency cases presentedby Mettgenberg and passed upon by Rothenberger were NN cases. Wethink, however, that the only conclusion that can be reached fromMettgenbergs testimony during the trial is that Rothenberger passedupon all clemency matters presented to him by Mettgenberg whichincluded NN cases. Mettgenberg stated that he was appointed to speedup clemency matters due to air raids and that he took the matter upwith the Reich Minister of Justice, Thierack, who at the time calledRothenberger on the telephone and told him to receive and pass upon theclemency matters submitted. Mettgenberg testified that he did presentclemency matters to Rothenberger by telephone conversations whichlasted for several hours and that Rothenberger then made the decisions.The defendant Mettgenberg assumed the burden of defending theillegality of the Night and Fog proceedings under the Ministryof Justice not only for himself but for all defendants connectedtherewith. He prefaced this defense with the following statement:   Today I am still of the view which I expressed in my affidavit.   My view is that it was regrettable because the courts, in these   matters, could not completely do justice to their foremost   task, the finding of the truth. Now that I believe I have heard   everything and believe myself to be able to survey the whole   matter, I have to say that as concerns the various evils between   which one had to choose, a transfer of the NN cases to the   administration of justice was, after all, the lesser evil, so   that this emergency solution which was made was probably the   only possible solution. (_Tr. pp. 62696270._)With respect to the legal foundation for the NN cases, three laws ordecrees are presented as justifying the proceedings. The first isarticle 161 of the Military Penal Code which dates back to the 1870sand which, as amended, provides:   A foreigner or a German who, in a foreign territory occupied   by German troops, acts against German troops or their members   or against an authority established by order of the Fuehrer and   thereby commits an act which is punishable according to the laws   of the Reich, is to be punished, just as if that act would have   been committed by him within the territory of the Reich.Whether this law violates international law of war need not bedetermined here because the defendants did not act under it in theexecution and enforcement of the Hitler Night and Fog decree. Nor doesthis law authorize the execution and enforcement of any such decree.The second legal ground presented is article 3, section 2 of the Codeof Penal Procedure of 17 August 1938 which provides for the punishmentof criminal acts committed in the areas of military operations inoccupied territory by foreigners or Germans and further provides that:   If a requirement of warfare demands it, * * * they may turn   over the prosecution to the ordinary courts in the rear army   area.There can be no criticism of this law. It was not applied in anyrespect in the Night and Fog cases; hence, it constitutes no defensefor the manner in which the Night and Fog decree was carried out.The third legal foundation for the proceeding is based upon the claimthat the Hitler decree of 7 December 1941 was a legal regulation forthe handling of offenses against the Reich or against the occupationforces of the German Army in occupied areas. With respect to thisdecree we are convinced that it has no legal basis either under theinternational law of warfare or under the international common lawas recognized by all civilized nations as heretofore set out in thisjudgment.The defendant Mettgenberg referred to and approved the testimony ofthe defendant Schlegelberger which states that the NN prisoners wereexpected to be, and were, tried materially according to the sameregulations which would have been applied to them by the courts martialin the occupied territories and that, accordingly, the rules ofprocedure had been curtailed to the utmost extent. This court martialprocedure was shown to have been used in the prosecution of NN personswho had been charged with high treason or preparation of treasonagainst the Reich.Mettgenberg testified as to the troubles the department had with theGestapo because the Gestapo insisted that they had already investigatedthe facts as to each NN prisoner and that these facts should beaccepted without further trial. This practice was not acceptable tothe Ministry of Justice. As to other difficulties in securing properevidence, Mettgenberg testified:   Even though investigations were first of all carried out in the   occupied territories before the NN prisoners were transferred to   Germany, yet it was a matter of course that that evidence was   not always without gaps.These gaps in the evidence were shown by [NG-261 and NG-264]Prosecution Exhibits 334 and 335 in which the public prosecutor atKatowice complained of the difficulty of securing sufficient proof dueto the utter secrecy of the proceedings. The Gestapo alone presentedthe evidence by rather dubious police transcripts and such policerecords occasionally had been obtained by inadmissible means.Mettgenberg testified that defendant von Ammon made an official trip toUpper Silesia to discuss these matters with the chief judge in Belgiumand northern France to remedy that state of affairs. This action didnot take place until 30 June 1944, which was only a few months beforethe Night and Fog matters were taken out of the hands of the Ministryof Justice, and all prisoners then held by the Ministry of Justice weretransferred to the Gestapo to be placed in concentration camps.Mettgenberg also testified to the difficulties experienced with theGestapo arising out of the fact that the Gestapo transferred many ofthese prisoners directly to concentration camps and thereby retainedcontrol over them. Nothing was done about the fact that the policetook the NN prisoners into police custody and retained them in policecustody.We find defendant Mettgenberg to be guilty under counts two and threeof the indictment. The evidence shows beyond a reasonable doubt thathe acted as a principal, aided, abetted, and was connected with theexecution and carrying out of the Hitler Night and Fog decree inviolation of numerous principles of international law, as has beenheretofore pointed out in this judgment.                       _THE DEFENDANT VON AMMON_From his own sworn statements we gain the following informationconcerning the defendant von Ammon. He joined the SA in December 1933,in which organization he held the rank of Scharfuehrer. He joined theNSDAP in May 1937. He was called to the Reich Ministry of Justice asof 1 January 1935, became a Landgerichtsrat on 1 February 1935, andLandgerichtsdirektor on 1 July 1937. His main activity in the Ministryduring that period concerned questions of international legal usage inpenal mattersAfter the Austrian Anschluss he was employed as liaison officer ofDepartment III (penal matters) in connection with Department VIII(Austria), in the Reich Ministry of Justice. He was consultantin the department for the administration of penal law underMinisterialdirektor Crohne. He was transferred to the Munich Court ofAppeals as Oberlandesgerichtsrat where he served until June 1940, atwhich time he was recalled to the Reich Ministry of Justice. As of 1March 1943 he was appointed Ministerial Counsellor in the Ministry ofJustice. He states (_NG-852, Pros. Ex. 55_):   From 1942 onward I dealt mainly with Nacht und Nebel cases   in the occupied territories. In my capacity as consultant for   Nacht und Nebel cases I made several duty trips to the occupied   territories and took part in discussions in Paris and Holland   which dealt with questions of Nacht und Nebel proceedings.The broad scope and the variety of the official activities of von Ammonmay be illustrated by reference to reports which he made to officialsof the Ministry of Justice during the year 1944. On 14 January 1944he reported at the Ministry upon jurisdiction of Denmark. On 10February he reported to the minister on Competence for Prosecutionof NN Cases. On 31 May, under the heading Submissions to the StateSecretary (Klemm), he reported on Action Against Stateless Jews,Admission of Legal Procedure. Under the heading Reports to the StateSecretary for 21 June 1944, he reported on Pastoral Service for NNPrisoners, after which in handwriting appears the word rejection.Under the heading Submissions to the Minister for 26 July, hereported on Proceedings of State Police in Lower Styria. Under theheading Reports to the Ministers of 5 October, he reported on TakingOver of Criminal Proceedings from the Eastern Districts. Under theheading Formal Verbal Reports to the Minister of 3 November 1944, hereported on Liquidation of Offenses from the Eastern Territories. On10 January 1945 it appears that he made a verbal report on the TakingOver Administration of Penal Justice of the Minister for the East.The prosecution introduced in evidence a captured document of 142pages in length, containing lists of many hundreds of death sentenceswhich were submitted to the Minister of Justice and at times to StateSecretary Klemm for final disposition. The cases were classifiedas clear or as doubtful. The former, clear, outnumbered thelatter. An examination of the document discloses that between 14January 1944 and 16 November of the same year the defendant von Ammonmade twenty-four reports on cases in which persons from the occupiedterritories had been sentenced to death under the Nacht und Nebelprocedure. The death sentences averaged more than one for every 3 daysof the entire period.In a notice addressed to Under Secretary Rothenberger, and to MinisterThierack, von Ammon reported that on 1 September 1942, in Kiel, Essen,and Cologne cases were pending against 1,456 persons charged under theNight and Fog decree.In view of the fact that von Ammon was in charge of Nacht und Nebelprocedure from 1942 until the end of the war, it is clear that wehave in evidence only incomplete records of the activities of thisdefendant in connection with the Night and Fog decree. The fragmentarycharacter of the captured documents which have been submitted rendersit impossible to give a complete picture of this criminal activity. Theillustrations which we have given and which cover only a portion ofthe time involved will, however, serve as an indication of the scopeof the activities which were under the direction of the defendantsMettgenberg and von Ammon. Von Ammon also participated in a lengthysecret correspondence concerning the transfer of NN cases to theSpecial Court at Oppeln and the necessity of allocating additionaljudges and public prosecutors to that court in view of the resultantincrease in the volume of work.The defendant von Ammon held an executive position of responsibilityinvolving the exercise of personal discretion. Within the ministry hewas in charge of the section which handled Night and Fog cases. Thedefendant Mettgenberg stated that the Night and Fog section within hissubdivision was headed by von Ammon and that whenever von Ammon haddoubts concerning the handling of individual cases joint discussionswere held. We quote:   When he had no doubts he could decide on matters himself.We have already set forth at length the statement of von Ammonconcerning his knowledge and activities and his misgivings concerningthe entire procedure. The defendants von Ammon and Mettgenberg were therepresentatives of the Reich Ministry of Justice at a conference atThe Hague on 2 November 1943 concerning New Regulations for Dealingwith Night and Fog Cases from the Netherlands. Von Ammon states thatassurance was given by Mettgenberg and himself that close connectionwould be maintained between the judicial authorities at Essen and theGerman authorities in the Netherlands in the handling of NN cases. Wehave already quoted a note signed by von Ammon wherein he remarked thatit was rather awkward that the defendants should learn the details oftheir charges only during the trial and commented on the insufficiencyof the translation facilities in the trial of French NN prisoners. VonAmmon is chargeable with actual knowledge concerning the systematicabuse of the judicial process in these cases.In respect to his other activities we refer to our general discussionunder the heading Night and Fog. We find the defendant von Ammonguilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity under counts two andthree of the indictment.                         _THE DEFENDANT JOEL_The professional career of the defendant Guenther Joel in the ThirdReich proceeded at the same pace as his career as a Party man; in fact,even before the war years his professional career merged with hiscareer in Nazi organizations, and to be more precise, in the SS and theSD--the organization which the IMT judgment has declared to be criminal.He became a member of the NSDAP on 1 May 1933 and entered the Ministryof Justice as a junior public prosecutor (Gerichtsassessor) on 7August 1933. In quick succession he became assistant public prosecutor(1 September 1933), public prosecutor (1 January 1934), senior publicprosecutor (1 February 1935), and chief public prosecutor (1 November1936).Between August 1933 and October 1937, Joel was the chief of a newlycreated subdepartment of the Reich Ministry of Justice, the CentralPublic Prosecution (Zentralstaatsanwaltschaft). In October 1937 thissubdepartment was dissolved, but the Reich Minister of Justice,Guertner, reserved the right to assign Joel as Referent for specialcases and subsequently made use of this right. After the dissolutionof the Central Public Prosecution, Joel worked as Referent in theMinistrys Penal Department III (later renumbered IV).By a formal letter of appointment, dated 19 December 1937 and signed byMinister Guertner, Joel was, in addition to his other duties, appointedliaison officer between the Reich Ministry of Justice and the SS,including the SD, as well as the Gestapo. A few months later, namely,in a letter of 2 May 1938, signed by Heydrich, Joel was, effective 30January 1938, admitted to the SS and, effective the same day, promotedto the rank of SS Untersturmfuehrer and given the position of leader(Fuehrer) in the SD Main Office (Security Service Main Office).His SS personnel record shows how quickly he climbed to highpositions in the SS and the SD: on 11 September 1938 he became SSObersturmfuehrer; on 30 January 1939, SS Hauptsturmfuehrer; on 26September 1940, SS Sturmbannfuehrer--holding all these ranks as leaderin the SD Main Office.The record shows that in his capacity as SS officer Joel was, between2 and 8 May 1939, sent on an official mission for the Security Office(SD). An official letter from the Reich Leader of SS, Chief of theSecurity Service Main Office, dated 28 April 1939, so notified theReich Minister of Justice. Again, on 4 July 1940, the Chief of theSecurity Police and the Security Service informed the Reich Ministry ofJustice that Joel had been put on the list of indispensable personson behalf of the Reich Leader SS and Chief of the German Police,thereby reserving to the Security Police and the Security Service theindispensable service of Joel and freeing him from military service.But in his answer, dated 11 July 1940, to this request, Freisler, UnderSecretary of the Ministry of Justice, asked:   To refrain from calling upon SS Captain Joel, senior public   prosecutor, for taking over duties for the Reich Leader SS and   Chief of the German Police. Dr. Joel, as you know, is entrusted   with extremely important reports at my ministry.The nature of these reports will be later discussed.On 1 May 1941 Joel was promoted to ministerial counsellor. He remainedwith the Reich Ministry of Justice until 12 May 1943.The reason for his leaving the Ministry was that on 7 May 1943 he wasappointed attorney general to supreme provincial court of appeals inHamm (Westphalia). By letter dated Fuehrer Headquarters, 12 May 1943,Bormann, Chief of the Party Chancellery (sentenced to death in absentiaby the IMT) personally confirmed his appointment. It should be addedthat a few weeks earlier, by letter of 13 March 1943 to Reich Ministerof Justice, Thierack, the Gauleiter of Westphalia, Alfred Meyer, alsoformally endorsed Joels appointment for attorney general at Hamm, inhis own name and in the name of deputy Gauleiter Hoffmann, in charge ofthe administration of the Gau Westphalia-South.Shortly after this new appointment, namely, as of 9 November 1943,Joel was promoted to the high rank of SS Obersturmbannfuehrer, whichappointment was approved by Himmler. His political and Party careerwent hand in hand with his professional career, and his promotionswere made by or approved by such high ranking Nazi officials asHimmler, Bormann, Heydrich, Thierack, and Freisler--whose desperate anddespicable characters are known to the world; the record in this caseis replete with many atrocities and crimes committed by these leadersand members of organizations which have been declared criminal by theIMT. Thus, Joel continued to the end as the confidant and trustedproteg of these most outstanding and notorious criminals of all time.It will be remembered that ever since December 1937, Joel in hisseveral capacities at the Ministry of Justice had, in addition to hisother duties, acted as liaison officer between the ministry and the SS,the SD, and the Gestapo. To this position a successor, Chief PublicProsecutor Franke, was appointed on 1 August 1943. Joel claims thatin fact he had ceased to act as such liaison officer when Thierackassumed office as Reich Minister of Justice in August 1942. However,the record shows that even after that time Joel made numerous reports,some of which are mentioned below, relating to the execution of deathpenalties imposed under the law against Poles and Jews, and relatingto the transfer of Poles who had received mild sentences, or had beenacquitted, or had served their term, to the Gestapo. These were thevery duties which he had to perform in the Reich Ministry as liaisonofficer. Even after Thieracks appointment as minister, Joel wasconnected with the interests of the Reich Security Office, and his workwas productive and satisfactory in the carrying out of the plan orscheme of racial persecution and extermination of Poles and Jews. On17 August 1943, defendant Rothenberger inducted defendant Joel into hisoffice as general public prosecutor at Hamm, praised him in the highestterms, and referred to him as an SS member and also to his rank of SSObersturmbannfuehrer. As late as 1945, when the question of militaryservice for Joel again arose, Gauleiter Hoffmann of South Westphaliaintervened in a letter to the Reich Ministry of Justice, referring tothe fact that Joel was known to be a member of the Waffen SS, and thatif he were to go into military service he would undoubtedly be assignedto the SS activities.Under our discussion of the Night and Fog decree, reference is madeto several documents which show Joel as having aided, abetted,participated in, and having been connected with, the Night and Fogscheme or plan.Rudolf Lehmann, lieutenant general of the legal department of the armedforces, stated under oath:   These cases were, as I seem to remember, handled by von Ammon,   also of that same division of the Reich Ministry of Justice.   General Public Prosecutor Joel, who was in the Ministry of   Justice until sometime in 1943, would be able to supply further   details on this Nacht und Nebel matter. Joel was general   public prosecutor in Hamm, and a court handling Nacht und   Nebel cases was located at Hamm. Other courts handling Nacht   und Nebel cases were located at Cologne, Breslau, and at one or   two other places unknown to me but which can be named by Joel.Joel became chief prosecutor of the court of appeals in Hamm, coveringall of Westphalia and the district of Essen, on 17 August 1943, whichoffice he continued to hold until the end of the war. In this positionhe was in charge of the Night and Fog program for the Special Courts inHamm and Essen until 15 March 1944 when these courts were transferredfarther east to Oppeln in the Katowice district. Reports of Joel showthat he attended conferences both in Hamm and in Belgium on Night andFog matters. The record also shows that the district of which he wasthe highest, and therefore the most responsible, prosecuting authoritywas, in area and population, one of the largest in Germany. He hadunder his supervision the senior public prosecutors and their staffs atthe Special Courts at Hamm and in Essen. It was his task to supervisethe work of all prosecutors assigned to his office. The Special Courtsin Hamm and Essen tried more Night and Fog cases than the combinedtotal of all other Special Courts and the Peoples Court. In law, Joelmust be held to have had the responsibility of these cases. The recordfurther shows that Joel assumed this responsibility.A letter addressed to Joel, dated 20 January 1944, stated that in thefuture all Night and Fog persons who were upon trial acquitted or whohad served their sentences, must be turned over for custody to theGestapo.A letter dated 26 January 1944 from Joel to the Reich Minister ofJustice complained about the delay which the defendant Lautz, chiefprosecutor at the Peoples Court, caused by his failure to return filesin NN cases. Joel pointed out that 84 Night and Fog prisoners who hadbeen held near Hamm since 1941 were still there.In November 1943 defendants von Ammon and Mettgenberg came to Hammenroute back to Berlin from the conferences they had attended inHolland. The purpose of their visit to Joel was to determine whetherthere was any available space in prison for the keeping of additionalNight and Fog prisoners to be transported from the Netherlands. Joelassured them that more prisoners could be accommodated and even opposedthe view of his Oberlandesgericht who stated they should not be sentto the Hamm area. They were sent to that area. In December 1943 Joelattended a conference in Brussels which he reported upon after hisreturn to Hamm, pertaining to Night and Fog prisoners who were sentfrom Belgium.The categorical denial of Joel of ever having transferred an NNprisoner or of ever having tried an NN prisoner or of ever havingissued an order to transfer an NN prisoner who had been acquittedor who had served his sentence, to Gestapo custody is no defense ofhis activities in connection with the custody, trial, execution, ortransfer of NN prisoners after they had served their sentences or hadbeen acquitted to the Gestapo.The high office which he held required him to supervise and properlyhandle Night and Fog cases filed in the courts where he was chiefprosecutor. He had numerous assistants whom he necessarily had toentrust with the prosecution and carrying out of the Night and Fogprogram and cases arising thereunder. The fact that Joel did notactually try the Night and Fog cases himself has no significance.He did supervise the men who tried and had executed some of themand imprisoned others and transferred others who were not guiltyof any crime or who had served their sentence, to the Gestapo andconcentration camps.The defendant Joel is chargeable with knowledge that the Night andFog program from its inception to its final conclusion constituted aviolation of the laws and customs of war.We turn now to the other activities here under indictment of thedefendant Joel.We direct attention to a document from the Reich Ministry of Justicewhich contains the program for conferences among the officials of theMinistry. In each instance the name of the official who is to reportis set opposite the subject for discussion. From this we gain someinformation as to the scope of the work assigned to Joel.According to this program Joel was scheduled to report upon thefollowing subjects. We quote:   Nullification plea, Maslanka.   Nullification plea, Beyer Bosich (Italian) article 4, VVO.   Matter of clemency Pongratz (70 year old farmer, non-delivery).   Handing-over of Poles to the State Police (cases Bartosinski   and Marcziniak).   Lenzinger Zoowoll AG (Lenzinger Artificial Wool, Ltd.).   Treatment of Jews and Poles, as well as Russians. Internal   order of the Reich Leader SS.   Bartosinski, Pole, shall be transferred from criminal custody   (3 years penal camp on account of sexual intercourse) to State   Police.   Marasyak, Pole, wanted to marry German maid in France.   Detention pending investigation. State Police demands him turned   in.   Should there be any reports during the war on the question of   mercy for Poles who have been sentenced to death on account of   the possession of weapons and other offenses and who have been   pardoned to 5 years penal servitude with the reserve of an   investigation after 2 to 3 years?   Extortion of food ration cards, Mrs. Ritter. Chorlow, Russian   from the district of Kursk, article 2, VVO. State Police wants   to punish with police measures.   Jakubowski, Pole, has raped German woman. He has been executed   by hanging. The criminal police asks for a burial certificate.   Uschako, workman, from the East, from old Soviet Russian   territory, has stolen a jacket. The Secret State Police sent him   to a labor education camp and requests cancellation of the order   to inflict 1-month imprisonment.Another significant incident relates to the case of two deservingNational Socialists. Our source of knowledge is a brief documentsigned by the defendant Joel. The facts stated are that a policeman anda temporary mayor shot two Polish priests for no reason other thanhatred for the Catholic clergy. On 11 June 1940, the two murdererswere sentenced to 15 years penal servitude for manslaughter. Joelstates that more than 2 years of the sentence had been served and thatthe Reich Leader SS asked for pardon. The document concludes as follows:   Penal servitude changed to 5 years imprisonment each.   Postponement of the serving of the sentence and of the   defamatory consequences for the duration of stay in a Waffen SS   probation unit. Further pardon in the case of the probation.   (Signed) Dr. JoelAs early as 1937 it is clear that Joel had knowledge of conditions inconcentration camps. A document marked For the time of circulation:Secret! to III-a: After circulation in sealed envelope to the Gestapogeneral files, contains the following:   2. As far as reports concerning executions when escaping from   concentration camps, etc., suicides in K.Z.s (concentration   camps) arrive, they shall continue to be dealt with by the   specialist competent for the respective subject. The general   consultant for political criminal matters, however, is to be   informed of the reports. They are to be submitted to him [at]   once.This order was circulated to all specialists for political criminalmatters. Joel was listed as a political specialist.An official report on a meeting of the presidential board of 1 February1939 shows that a report was given by the Chief Public Prosecutor ondevelopments in connection with the events of 9 to 11 November 1938(the Jewish pogrom). We quote:   The Reich Minister of Justice and Senior Public Prosecutor Joel   pointed out that it was impossible, of course, to handle this   matter in the usual judicial manner; if the top men disregarded   legal principles, it was impossible to prosecute people   concerned with the execution. For instance, the viewpoint of   violation of the public peace should be dropped. This is legally   justified _inter alia_ by the fact that the culprits were   not conscious of any violation, since they were acting under   orders. As far as the criminal offenses committed on that   occasion are concerned, trifles should be dropped. Otherwise,   however, proceedings can only be quashed by the Fuehrer, whereas   serious criminal offenses such as rape and race defilement must   be prosecuted. The order to prosecute is issued in any case by   the minister after the culprits, if they are members of the   Party or of any organization, have been excluded by a special   department of the Supreme Party Tribunal in Berlin.It is self-evident that if prosecution was to take place only after aParty tribunal had excluded them, they would live a long and happy lifeof freedom.Defendant Joel became a Referent in the Reich Ministry of Justice withauthority and duty to review penal cases from the Incorporated EasternTerritories after the occupation of Poland. In this capacity he handledmany of the cases tried pursuant to the decree against Poles and Jews.In defense of these acts, Joel testified that he felt obligated by theexisting laws and so complied with them. Joel did not have the sameview as other officials that after the surrender of the Polish nationthe nationals of the annexed part of Poland became German nationals. Hetestified that such a Polish citizen after 1 September 1939 remained aPolish national and that a Polish national is never a German. Joelfrankly admitted that he knew he was not dealing with Germans but withforeign nationals.In his capacity as Referent for the Incorporated Eastern TerritoriesJoel, as liaison officer between the Reich Ministry of Justice andthe Gestapo, took part in conferences with others from Department IVconcerning the disposition of such Jewish and Polish cases. In oneinstance he reported having discussed an order of Himmlers as tothe treatment Poles and Jews should receive. In another instance hereported ordering the transfer of Poles who had been sentenced to apenal camp for 3 years to the Gestapo.As a witness, Schlegelberger testified concerning transfers to thepolice, which he described as a very sad chapter for anyone who has asense of justice. Guertner protested against this procedure and madecompilations of press reports concerning executions by the police.   Lammers actually submitted these compilations to Hitler but   told Guertner later Hitler had said that he had not given   a general directive to carry out these shootings, but in   individual cases he could not do without these measures because   the courts, that was military courts as well as civil courts,   were not able to take care of the special conditions as created   by the war. And, Lammers at the same time announced that Hitler   in a further case had already ordered the execution by shooting.Schlegelberger testified further that after an order had been made forthe transfer of a prisoner to the police, there was a time limit of 24hours, at the end of which the police were required to report that theorder had been executed. Schlegelberger states that Guertner chargedthe defendant Joel with the mission of representing the Ministry ofJustice with the police in connection with these transfers. It appearsthat the Ministry of Justice, through Joel, was able to intervene insome cases and to prevent the transfers. Schlegelberger testified:   * * * the attempts to intervene on the part of the Ministry of   Justice were successful in some cases but, if all possibilities   had been exhausted, and if in spite of that he had not   succeeded in having the order issued by the police withdrawn,   nothing was left but to issue the instructions to the executing   authority not to offer any resistance but to hand the man over   to the police when they requested him.Notwithstanding the reluctance with which the officials of the Ministryof Justice acted, it appears from the foregoing that they did cooperatein the transfer of prisoners to the police.From 10 September 1942 to March 1943, Joel reviewed 105 death sentencespassed by courts in the Incorporated Eastern Territories and in mostcases gave final authorization for their execution.In his capacity as such Referent, Joel reviewed and passed upon 16death sentences of Poles who had committed alleged crimes against theReich or the German occupation forces. One of these Poles was bornin Cleveland, Ohio, in the United States, and his death sentence wascommuted to life imprisonment because Joel was fearful his executionwould involve the Reich in international complications. The remaining15 Poles were executed.As Referent, Joel was shown by captured official documents to have hadknowledge that many Jewish and Polish political prisoners were beingexecuted under the law against Jews and Poles. This matter was calledto his attention because of a dispute as to who should handle thecorpses of the executed prisoners. One main difficulty was that, underHimmlers orders, these corpses were to be turned over to the SecretPolice for disposition. The mayor and police of Posen [Poznan] refusedto handle the corpses of Poles and Jews who were not executed aspolitical prisoners. Joel was thereupon instructed to handle the mattertemporarily and to work out a permanent plan for such burials, which helater assisted in doing.As Referent in the department of justice and as liaison officer betweenthe department and the SS, Joel obtained extensive information andexercised far-reaching power in the execution of the law against Jewsand Poles. He therefore took an active part in the execution of theplan or scheme for the persecution and extermination of Jews and Poles.Concerning Joels membership in the SS and SD, a consideration of allof the evidence convinces us beyond a reasonable doubt that he retainedsuch membership with full knowledge of the criminal character of thoseorganizations. No man who had his intimate contacts with the ReichSecurity Main Office, the SS, the SD, and the Gestapo could possiblyhave been in ignorance of the general character of those organizations.We find defendant Joel guilty under counts two, three, and four._THE DEFENDANT ROTHAUG_Oswald Rothaug was born 17 May 1897. His education was interruptedfrom 1916 to 1918 while he was in the army. He passed the finallaw examination in 1922 and the State examination for the higheradministration of justice in 1925.He joined the NSDAP in the spring of 1938 and the membership was madeeffective from May 1937.Rothaug was a member of the National Socialist Jurists League and theNational Socialist Public Welfare Association. In his affidavit hedenies belonging to the SD. However, the testimony of Elkar and his ownadmission on the witness stand establishes that he was an honorarycollaborator for the SD on legal matters.In December 1925 he began his career as a jurist, first as anassistant to an attorney in Ansbach and later as assistant judge atvarious courts. In 1927 he became public prosecutor in Hof in chargeof criminal cases. From 1929 to 1933 he officiated as counsellor atthe local court in Nuernberg. In June 1933 he became senior publicprosecutor in the public prosecution in Nuernberg. Here he was theofficial in charge of general criminal cases, assistant of the ChiefPublic Prosecutor handling examination of suspensions of proceedingsand of petitions for pardon. From November to April 1937 he officiatedas counsellor of the district court in Schweinfurt. He was legaladvisor in the civil and penal chamber and at the Court of Assizes, aswell as chairman of the lay assessors court. From April 1937 to May1943 he was director of the district court in Nuernberg, except for aperiod in August and September of 1939 when he was in the Wehrmacht.During this time he was chairman of the Court of Assizes, of a penalchamber, and of the Special Court.From May 1943 to April 1945 he was public prosecutor of the publicprosecution at the Peoples Court in Berlin. Here, as head ofDepartment I he handled for a time cases of high treason in thesouthern Reich territory, and from January 1944 cases concerning theundermining of public morale in the Reich territory.Crimes charged in the indictment, as heretofore stated in this opinion,have been established by the evidence in this case. The questions,therefore, to be determined as to the defendant Rothaug are: first,whether he had knowledge of any crime so established; and second,whether he was a participant in or took a consenting part in itscommission.Rothaugs sources of knowledge have, with those of all the defendants,already been pointed out. But Rothaugs knowledge was not limitedto those general sources. Rothaug was an official of considerableimportance in Nuernberg. He had many political and official contacts;among these--he was the friend of Haberkern, Gau inspector of theGau Franconia; he was the friend and associate of Oeschey, Gaulegal advisor for the Gau Franconia; and was himself Gauwalter ofthe Lawyers League. He was the honorary collaborator for the SD.According to the witness Elkar, [he was] the agent of the SD forNuernberg and vicinity, this position was more important than that ofa confidential agent, and an honorary collaborator was active in SDaffairs. He testifies that Rothaug took the SS oath of secrecy.Whether Rothaug knew of all the aspects of the crimes alleged, we neednot determine. He knew of crimes as established by the evidence, and itis the function of this Tribunal to determine his connection, if any,therewith.The defendant is charged under counts two, three, and four of theindictment. Under count four he is charged with being a member of theParty Leadership Corps. He is not charged with membership in the SD.The proof as to count four establishes that he was Gauwalter of theLawyers League. The Lawyers League was a formation of the Party andnot a part of the Leadership Corps as determined by the InternationalMilitary Tribunal in the case against Goering, et al.As to counts two and four of the indictment, from the evidencesubmitted, the Tribunal finds the defendant not guilty. The question ofthe defendants guilt as to count three of the indictment remains to bedetermined.The evidence as to the character and activities of the defendant isvoluminous. We shall confine ourselves to the question as to whetheror not he took a consenting part in the plan for the persecution,oppression, and extermination of Poles and Jews.His attitude of virulent hostility toward these races is provedfrom many sources and is in no wise shaken by the affidavits he hassubmitted on his own behalf.The evidence in this regard comes from his own associates--the judges,prosecutors, defense counsel, medical experts, and others with whom hedealt. Among, but not limited to these, we cite the evidence of Doebig,Ferber, Bauer, Dorfmueller, Elkar, Engert, Groben, and Markl. Inparticular the testimony of Father Schosser is important. He testifiedas to many statements made by the defendant Rothaug during the trialof his own case, showing the defendants hostility to Poles and hisgeneral attitude toward them. He stated that concerning the Poles ingeneral, Rothaug expressed himself in the following manner:   If he (Rothaug) had his way, then no Pole would be buried in a   German cemetery, and then he went on to make the remark which   everybody heard in that courtroom--that he would get up from his   coffin if there was a Pole being buried near to him. Rothaug   himself had to laugh because of this mean joke, and he went on   to say, You have to be able to hate, because according to the   Bible, God is a hating God.The testimony of Elkar is even more significant. He testifies thatRothaug believed in severe measures against foreigners and particularlyagainst Poles and Jews, whom he felt should be treated differentlyfrom German transgressors. Rothaug felt there was a gap in the law inthis respect. He states that Rothaug asserted that in his own court heachieved this discrimination by interpretation of existing laws butthat other courts failed to do so. Such a gap, according to Rothaug,should be closed by singling out Poles and Jews for special treatment.Elkar testifies that recommendations were made by the defendantRothaug, through the witness, to higher levels and that the subsequentdecree of 1941 against Poles and Jews conformed to Rothaugs ideas asexpressed and forwarded by the witness Elkar through SD channels to theRSHA.This animosity of the defendant to these races is further establishedby documents in this case which show that his discrimination againstthese races encompassed others who he felt lacked the necessaryharshness to carry out the policy of the Nazi State and Party towardthese people.In this connection the communication of Oeschey to Deputy GauleiterHolz, concerning Doebig, is worthy of note. In this communication manycharges were made against Doebig for his failure to take action againstofficials under him who had failed to carry out the Nazi programsagainst Jews and Poles. Oeschey testified that these charges werecopied from a letter submitted to him by the defendant Rothaug and thatthe defendant assumed responsibility for these charges. Rothaug deniesthat he assumed responsibility or had anything to do with the chargesmade, except in one immaterial instance. However, in the light of thecircumstances themselves, the Tribunal accepts Oescheys testimonyin this regard, particularly in view of the unimpeached affidavitof Oescheys secretary to the effect that these charges were copieddirectly by her from a letter of Rothaugs.Documentary proof of Rothaugs attitude in this respect is furtherfound in the records of cases tried by him which hereafter will beconsidered.Proof as to his animus is not shaken by his own testimony. It isconfirmed by his testimony. He states:   In my view, by introduction of the question of the so-called   incredibility of Poles, the whole problem is shifted onto   another plane. It is a matter of course that a nation, which   has been subjected by another nation, and which is in a state   of stress--that a citizen of such a country which had been   subjected to another _vis--vis_ the victorious nation,   finds himself in quite a different moral-ethical relationship.   It is useless to shut your eyes against reality. Of course,   he finds himself in a different moral relationship from the   relationship in which a German citizen would find himself. It is   so natural there is no point in ignoring it. There is no need to   lie.His explanations as to his feeling toward Poles, given in connectionwith the Schosser arrest and trial are also most enlightening but tooextensive to quote here.Concerning his participation in the Nazi policy of persecutionand extermination of persons of these races, we shall confine ourdiscussions to three cases which were tried by Rothaug as presidingjudge.The first case to be considered is that of Durka and Struss. Ourknowledge of this case is based primarily upon the evidence of HansKern, the defense counsel of one of these defendants; Hermann Markl,the prosecutor in the case; and the testimony of the defendant Rothaug.The essential facts are in substance as follows: Two Polish girls--one,according to the testimony of Kern, 17 years of age, the othersomewhat older--were accused of starting a fire in an armament plantin Bayreuth. This alleged fire did not do any material damage to theplant, but they were in the vicinity when it started and were arrestedand interrogated by the Gestapo. Both gave alleged confessions tothe Gestapo. Almost immediately following this occurrence, they werebrought to Nuernberg by the Gestapo for trial before the Special Court.Upon their arrival the prosecutor in the case, Markl, was directed todraw up an indictment based upon the Gestapo interrogation. This was at11 oclock of the day they were tried.The witness Kern was summoned by the defendant Rothaug to act asdefense counsel in the case approximately 2 hours before the case cameto trial. He informed Rothaug that he would not have time to prepare adefense. According to Kern, Rothaug stated that if he did not take overthe defense, the trial would have to be conducted without a defensecounsel. According to Rothaug, he told Kern that he would get anotherdefense counsel. In either event the trial was to go on at once.The trial itself, according to Kern, lasted about half an hour;according to the defendant, approximately an hour; according to Markl,it was conducted with the speed of a court martial.The evidence consisted of the alleged confessions which one of thedefendants repudiated before the court. Rothaug states that hethereupon called the Gestapo official who had obtained these allegedconfessions and questioned him under oath. According to Rothaug theGestapo official stated that the interrogations were perfectly regular.There was also a letter in evidence which it was said the defendantshad tried to destroy before their capture. The witness Kern stated oncross-examination that this letter had little materiality.The defendant attempts to justify the speed of this trial uponthe legal requirements in existence at this time. He states, incontradiction to the other witnesses, that a clear case of sabotagewas established. This Tribunal is not inclined to accept the defendantRothaugs version of the facts which were established. Under thecircumstances and in the brief period of the trial, the Tribunal doesnot believe the defendant could have established those facts fromevidence.According to the witness Kern, one of the defendants was 17 years ofage. This assertion as to age was not disputed. A German 18 years ofage or thereunder would have come under the German Juvenile Act andwould not have been subject to trial before a Special Court or tocapital punishment. Whatever the age of the defendants in this case,they were tried under the procedure described in the ordinance againstPoles and Jews which was in effect at this time, by a judge who did notbelieve the statements of Polish defendants, according to the testimonyin this case. These two young Polish women were sentenced to death andexecuted 4 days after trial. In the view of this Tribunal, based uponthe evidence, these two young women did not have what amounted to atrial at all but were executed because they were Polish nationals inconformity with the Nazi plan of persecution and extermination.The second case to be considered is the Lopata case. This was a casein which a young Polish farmhand, approximately 25 years of age, isalleged to have made indecent advances to his employers wife.He first was tried in the district court at Neumarkt. That courtsentenced him to a term of 2 years in the penitentiary. A nullity pleawas filed in this case before the Reich Supreme Court, and the ReichSupreme Court returned the case to the Special Court at Nuernberg fora new trial and sentence. The Reich Supreme Court stated that thejudgment of the lower court was defective, since it did not discuss indetail whether the ordinance against public enemies was applicable andstated that if such ordinance were applicable--a thing which seemedprobable, a much more severe sentence was deemed necessary.The case was therefore again tried in violation of the fundamentalprinciples of justice that no man should be tried twice for the sameoffense.In the second trial of the case, the defendant Rothaug obligingly foundthat the ordinance against public enemies had been violated.In its reasons, the court states the facts on which the verdict wasbased as follows:   The wife of farmer Schwenzl, together with the accused and a   Polish girl, chopped straw in the barn. The accused was standing   on the righthand side of the machine to carry out the work.   Suddenly, in the middle of the work, the accused, without saying   anything, touched with his hand the genitals of the wife of   farmer Schwenzl, through her skirt. When she said, after this   unexpected action of the defendant, You hog, do you think I am   not disgusted about anything; you think you can do that because   my husband is sick, the accused laughed and in spite of this   dissuasion touched again the genitals of the farmers wife above   her skirt. The wife of farmer Schwenzl slapped him after that.   In spite of this, the accused continued with his impertinent   behavior; for a third time he touched the genitals of the   farmers wife above the skirt.          *       *       *       *       *       *       *   The accused did not make a complete confession. He states that   he only once, for fun, touched the farmers wifes genitals   above the skirt.   The court is convinced, on account of the testimony given   by the witness Therese Schwenzl, who makes a trustworthy   impression, that the affair occurred exactly as described by the   witness. Therefore, its findings were arrived at according to   the testimony given by her.The Polish woman who was present at the time of this alleged assaultis not listed as a witness. Rothaug has stated in his testimony beforethis Court that he never had a Polish witness.As for the reasons for bringing the defendant under the public enemyordinance, the following facts are stated in the reasons for theverdict: Lopata having had some minor difficulties with the farmerSchwenzl refused to eat his noon meal and induced the Polish servantmaid to do likewise. Thereupon, farmer Schwenzl, his employer, calledhim to account in the stable. The defendant put up resistance to thefarmers admonitions by arming himself with a dung fork. It isfurther stated that the Pole, at the threshold of the farm hallway,again turned against his employer and let him go only when attacked bythe sheep dog which the farmer kept.As to the actual reasons for the sentence of this Polish farmhand todeath, the following paragraphs are more significant:   Thus, the defendant gives the impression of a thoroughly   degenerate personality, which is marked by excitability   and a definite trend to mendacity, or to lying. The whole   inferiority of the defendant, I would say, lies in the sphere of   character and is obviously based on his being a part of Polish   subhumanity, or in his belonging to Polish subhumanity.   The drafting of men into the armed forces effected a heavy   labor shortage in all spheres of life at home, last but not   least in agriculture. To compensate this, Polish laborers, among   others, had to be used to a large extent, mainly as farmhands.   These men cannot be supervised by the authorities to such an   extent as would be necessary due to their insubordinate and   criminal disposition.          *       *       *       *       *       *       *   The action of the defendant constitutes a considerable   disturbance of the peace of the persons immediately concerned   by his mean actions. The rural population has the right to   expect that the strongest measures will be taken against such   terrorization by foreign elements. But beyond disregarding   the honor of the wife of farmer Schwenzl, the attack of the   defendant is directed against the purity of the German blood.   Looking at it from this point of view, the defendant showed such   insubordination within the German living space that his action   has to be considered as especially significant. * * *   Accordingly, as outlined in article III, paragraph 2, second   sentence of the ordinance against Poles and Jews, the crime   of the defendant, which in connection with his other behavior   shows a climax of unheard-of impudence, has to be considered   as especially serious so that the death sentence had to be   passed as the only just expiation, which is also necessary in   the interest of the Reich security to deter Poles of similar   mentality.The defendant was sentenced under the ordinance against Poles and Jewsin the Incorporated Eastern Territories. The verdict was signed by thedefendant Rothaug, and an application for clemency was disapproved byhim.When on the witness stand, the defendant Rothaug was asked thefollowing question by the court:   * * * if Lopata had been a racial German, all other facts being   the same as they were in the Lopata case, is it your judgment   that the nullity plea would have been invoked and that the   Supreme Court would have ordered the case sent back to you for   another trial? I should like your opinion on that.Rothaug replied as follows to this question:   Mr. President, this question is very interesting, but I cannot   even imagine that possibility even theoretically, because the   very elements which are of the greatest importance could not be   the same in the case of a German.Lopata was sentenced to death and subsequently executed.The third case to be considered is that of Leo Katzenberger. The recordin this case shows that Lehmann Israel Katzenberger, commonly calledLeo Katzenberger, was a merchant and head of the Jewish communityin Nuernberg; that he was sentenced to death for an offense underparagraph 2, legally identical with an offense under paragraph 4 of thedecree against public enemies in connection with the offense of racialpollution. The trial was held in the public session on 13 March 1942.Katzenbergers age at that time was over 68 years.The offense of racial pollution with which he was charged comes underarticle 2 of the Law for the Protection of German Blood and Honor. Thissection reads as follows:   Sexual intercourse (except in marriage) between Jews and German   nationals of German or German-related blood is forbidden.The applicable sections of the Decree Against Public Enemies reads asfollows:                              Section 2                       Crimes During Air Raids   Whoever commits a crime or offense against the body, life, or   property, taking advantage of air raid protection measures, is   punishable by hard labor of up to 15 years, or for life, and in   particularly severe cases, punishable by death.       *       *       *       *       *       *       *                              Section 4              Exploitation of the State of War a Reason                      for More Severe Punishment   Whoever commits a criminal act exploiting the extraordinary   conditions caused by war is punishable beyond the regular   punishment limits with hard labor of up to 15 years, or for   life, or is punishable by death if the sound common sense of the   people requires it on account of the crime being particularly   despicable.The evidence in this case, aside from the record, is based primarilyupon the testimony of Hans Groben, the investigating judge who firstinvestigated the case; Hermann Markl, the official who prosecuted thecase; Karl Ferber, who was one of the associate judges in the trial;Heinz Hoffmann, who was the other associate judge in the trial; ArminBaur, who was medical expert in the trial; Georg Engert, who dealt withclemency proceedings; and Otto Ankenbrand, another investigating judge.The salient facts established in connection with this case are insubstance as follows: Sometime in the first half of the year 1941 thewitness Groben issued a warrant of arrest against Katzenberger, who wasaccused of having had intimate relations with the photographer Seiler.According to the results of the police inquiry, actual intercourse hadnot been proved, and Katzenberger denied the charge. Upon Grobensadvice, Katzenberger agreed that he would not move against thewarrant of arrest at that time but would await the results of furtherinvestigation. These further investigations were very lengthy, althoughGroben pressed the public prosecutor for speed. The police, in spiteof their efforts, were unable to get further material evidence, and itbecame apparent that the way to clarify the situation was to take thesworn statement of Seiler, and this was done.In her sworn statement she said that Katzenberger had known both herand her family for many years before she had come to Nuernberg andthat his relationship to her was a friendly and fatherly one anddenied the charge of sexual intercourse. The evidence also showed thatKatzenberger had given Seiler financial assistance on various occasionsand that he was administrator of the property where Seiler lived, whichwas owned by a firm of which he was a partner. Upon Seilers statement,Groben informed Dr. Herz, counsel for Katzenberger, of the result andsuggested that it was the right time to move against the warrant ofarrest.When this was done, Rothaug learned of it and ordered that theKatzenberger case be transferred from the criminal divisional courtto the Special Court. The first indictment was withdrawn, and anotherindictment was prepared for the Special Court.The witness Markl states that Rothaug dominated the prosecution,especially through his close friendship with the senior publicprosecutor, Dr. Schroeder, who was the superior of Markl.The indictment before the Special Court was prepared according to theorders of Rothaug, and Katzenberger was not charged only with racedefilement in this new indictment, but there was also an additionalcharge under the decree against public enemies, which made the deathsentence permissible. The new indictment also joined the Seiler womanon a charge of perjury. The effect of joining Seiler in the chargeagainst Katzenberger was to preclude her from being a witness forthe defendant, and such a combination was contrary to establishedpractice. Rothaug at this time told Markl that there was sufficientproof of sexual intercourse between Seiler and Katzenberger to convincehim, and that he was prepared to condemn Katzenberger to death. Marklinformed the Ministry of Justice of Rothaugs intended procedureagainst Katzenberger and was told that if Rothaug so desired it, theprocedure would be approved.Prior to the trial, the defendant Rothaug called on Dr. Armin Baur,medical counsellor for the Nuernberg Court, as the medical expert forthe Katzenberger case. He stated to Baur that he wanted to pronounce adeath sentence and that it was, therefore, necessary for the defendantto be examined. This examination, Rothaug stated, was a mere formalitysince Katzenberger would be beheaded anyhow. To the doctors reproachthat Katzenberger was old, and it seemed questionable whether he couldbe charged with race defilement, Rothaug stated:   It is sufficient for me that the swine said that a German girl   had sat upon his lap.The trial itself, as testified to by many witnesses, was in the natureof a political demonstration. High Party officials attended, includingReich Inspector Oexle. Part of the group of Party officials appeared inuniform.During the proceedings, Rothaug tried with all his power to encouragethe witnesses to make incriminating statements against the defendants.Both defendants were hardly heard by the court. Their statements werepassed over or disregarded. During the course of the trial, Rothaugtook the opportunity to give the audience a National Socialist lectureon the subject of the Jewish question. The witnesses found greatdifficulty in giving testimony because of the way in which the trialwas conducted, since Rothaug constantly anticipated the evaluation ofthe facts and gave expression to his own opinions.Because of the way the trial was conducted, it was apparent that thesentence which would be imposed was the death sentence.After the introduction of evidence was concluded, a recess was taken,during which time the prosecutor Markl appeared in the consultationroom and Rothaug made it clear to him that he expected the prosecutionto ask for a death sentence against Katzenberger and a term in thepenitentiary for Seiler. Rothaug at this time also gave him suggestionsas to what he should include in his arguments.The reasons for the verdict were drawn up by Ferber. They were basedupon the notes of Rothaug as to what should be included. Considerablespace is given to Katzenbergers ancestry and the fact that he wasof the Mosaic faith, although that fact was admitted by Katzenberger.Such space is also given to the relationship between Katzenberger andSeiler. That there was no proof of actual sexual intercourse is clearfrom the opinion. The proof seems to have gone little farther than thefact that the defendant Seiler had at times sat upon Katzenbergerslap and that he had kissed her, which facts were also admitted. Manyassumptions were made in the reasons stated which obviously are notborne out by the evidence. The court even goes back to the time priorto the passage of the law for the protection of German Blood and Honor,during which Katzenberger had known Seiler. It draws the conclusionapparently without evidence, that their relationship for a period ofapproximately 10 years, had always been of a sexual nature. The opinionundertakes to bring the case under the decision of the Reich SupremeCourt that actual sexual intercourse need not be proved, provided theacts are sexual in nature.Having wandered far afield from the proof to arrive at this conclusionas to the matter of racial pollution, the court then proceeds to gofar afield in order to bring the case under the decree against publicenemies. Here the essential facts proved were that the defendantSeilers husband was at the front and that Katzenberger, on one orpossibly two occasions, had visited her after dark. On both points thefollowing paragraphs of the opinion are enlightening (_NG-154, Pros.Ex. 152_):   Looked at from this point of view, Katzenbergers conduct is   particularly contemptible. Together with his offense of racial   pollution he is also guilty of an offense under paragraph 4 of   the ordinance against peoples parasites.[671] It should be   noted here that the national community is in need of increased   legal protection from all crimes attempting to destroy or   undermine its inner cohesion.   On several occasions since the outbreak of war the defendant   Katzenberger crept into Seilers flat after dark. In those cases   the defendant exploited the measures taken for the protection   in air raids. His chances were further improved by the absence   of the bright street lighting which exists in the street along   Spittlertorgraben in peacetime. He exploited this fact fully   aware of its significance because thus he instinctively escaped   during his excursions being observed by people in the street.   The visits paid by Katzenberger to Seiler under the protection   of the black-out served at least the purpose of keeping   relations going. It does not matter whether during these visits   extra-marital sexual relations took place or whether they only   conversed as when the husband was present, as Katzenberger   claims. The request to interrogate the husband was therefore   overruled. The court holds the view the defendants actions,   done with a purpose within a definite plan, amount to a crime   against the body according to paragraph 2 of the ordinance   against peoples parasites. The law of 15 September 1935 has   been passed to protect German blood and German honor. The Jews   racial pollution amounts to a grave attack on the purity of   German blood, the object of the attack being the body of a   German woman. The general need for protection therefore makes   appear as unimportant the behavior of the other partner in   racial pollution who anyway is not liable to prosecution. The   fact that racial pollution occurred up to at least 19391940   becomes clear from statements made by the witness Zeuschel to   whom the defendant repeatedly and consistently admitted that up   to the end of 1939 and the beginning of 1940 she was used to   sitting on the Jews lap and exchanging caresses as described   above.   Thus, the defendant committed an offense also under paragraph 2   of the ordinance against peoples parasites.   The personal character of the male defendant also stamps him   as a peoples parasite. The racial pollution practiced by him   through many years grew, by exploiting wartime conditions,   into an attitude inimical to the nation, into an attack on the   security of the national community, during an emergency.   This was why the defendant Katzenberger had to be sentenced   both on a charge of racial pollution and of an offense under   paragraphs 2 and 4 of the ordinance against peoples parasites,   the two charges being taken in conjunction according to   paragraph 73 of the criminal code.          *       *       *       *       *       *       *   In passing sentence the court was guided by these   considerations: The political life of the German people under   national socialism is based on the community. One fundamental   factor of the life of the national community is race. If a Jew   commits racial pollution with a German woman, this amounts to   polluting the German race and, by polluting a German woman,   to a grave attack on the purity of German blood. The need for   protection is particularly strong.   Katzenberger has been practicing pollution for years. He was   well acquainted with the point of view taken by patriotic German   men and women as regards racial questions, and he knew that by   this conduct he insulted the patriotic feelings of the German   people. Nor did he mend his ways after the National Socialist   revolution of 1933, after the passing of the law for the   protection of German blood, in 1935, after the action against   Jews in 1938, or the outbreak of war in 1939.   The court therefore regards it as indicated, as the only   feasible answer to the frivolous conduct of the defendant, to   pass death sentence, as the heaviest punishment provided by   paragraph 4 of the decree against public enemies. His case   takes on the complexion of a particularly grave crime as he was   to be sentenced in connection with the offense of committing   racial pollution, under paragraph 2 of the Decree Against   Public Enemies, especially if one takes into consideration the   defendants character and the accumulative nature of commission.   This is why the defendant is liable to the death penalty which   the law provides for only such cases. Dr. Baur, the medical   expert, describes the defendants fully responsible.We have gone to some extent into the evidence of this case to show thenature of the proceedings and the animus of the defendant Rothaug.One undisputed fact, however, is sufficient to establish this caseas being an act in furtherance of the Nazi program to persecute andexterminate Jews. That fact is that nobody but a Jew could have beentried for racial pollution. To this offense was added the charge thatit was committed by Katzenberger through exploiting war conditions andthe black-out. This brought the offense under the ordinance againstpublic enemies and made the offense capital. Katzenberger was triedand executed only because he was a Jew. As stated by Elkar in histestimony, Rothaug achieved the final result by interpretations ofexisting laws as he boasted to Elkar he was able to do.This Tribunal is not concerned with the legal incontestability underGerman law of these cases above discussed. The evidence establishesbeyond a reasonable doubt that Katzenberger was condemned and executedbecause he was a Jew; and Durka, Struss, and Lopata met the same fatebecause they were Poles. Their execution was in conformity with thepolicy of the Nazi State of persecution, torture, and exterminationof these races. The defendant Rothaug was the knowing and willinginstrument in that program of persecution and extermination.From the evidence it is clear that these trials lacked the essentialelements of legality. In these cases the defendants court, in spiteof the legal sophistries which he employed, was merely an instrumentin the program of the leaders of the Nazi State of persecution andextermination. That the number the defendant could wipe out withinhis competency was smaller than the number involved in the masspersecutions and exterminations by the leaders whom he served, doesnot mitigate his contribution to the program of those leaders. His actswere more terrible in that those who might have hoped for a last refugein the institutions of justice found these institutions turned againstthem and a part of the program of terror and oppression.The individual cases in which Rothaug applied the cruel anddiscriminatory law against Poles and Jews cannot be considered inisolation. It is of the essence of the charges against him that heparticipated in the national program of racial persecution. It is ofthe essence of the proof that he identified himself with this nationalprogram and gave himself utterly to its accomplishment. He participatedin the crime of genocide.Again, in determining the degree of guilt the Tribunal has consideredthe entire record of his activities, not alone under the head of racialpersecution but in other respects also. Despite protestations thathis judgments were based solely upon evidence introduced in court, weare firmly convinced that in numberless cases Rothaugs opinions wereformed and decisions made, and in many instances publicly or privatelyannounced before the trial had even commenced and certainly beforeit was concluded. He was in constant contact with his confidentialassistant Elkar, a member of the criminal SD, who sat with him inweekly conferences in the chambers of the court. He formed hisopinions from dubious records submitted to him before trial. By hismanner and methods he made his court an instrumentality of terror andwon the fear and hatred of the population. From the evidence of hisclosest associates as well as his victims, we find that Oswald Rothaugrepresented in Germany the personification of the secret Nazi intrigueand cruelty. He was and is a sadistic and evil man. Under any civilizedjudicial system he could have been impeached and removed from officeor convicted of malfeasance in office on account of the schemingmalevolence with which he administered injustice.Upon the evidence in this case it is the judgment of this Tribunal thatthe defendant Rothaug is guilty under count three of the indictment. Inhis case we find no mitigating circumstances; no extenuation.                       _THE DEFENDANT BARNICKEL_The evidence has not convinced the Tribunal beyond a reasonable doubtof the guilt of the defendant Barnickel. He is therefore acquitted onall counts.                       _THE DEFENDANT PETERSEN_Upon the evidence submitted, it is the judgment of this Tribunal thatthe defendant Hans Petersen is not guilty under any of the countscharged against him in the indictment.                       _THE DEFENDANT NEBELUNG_Upon the evidence submitted, it is the judgment of this Tribunal thatthe defendant Nebelung is not guilty under any of the counts chargedagainst him in the indictment.                        _THE DEFENDANT CUHORST_The defendant Cuhorst is charged under counts two, three, and four ofthe indictment.There is no evidence in this case to substantiate the charge undercount two of the indictment.As to count four, the proof establishes that Cuhorst was aGaustellenleiter and so a member of the Gau staff and a sponsoringmember of the SS. His function as Gaustellenleiter was that of a publicpropaganda speaker.In its judgment the International Military Tribunal, in defining themembers of the Party Leadership Corps who came under its decision asbeing members of a criminal organization, states the following:   The decision of the Tribunal on these staff organizations   includes only the Amtsleiter who were heads of offices on the   staffs of the Reichsleitung, Gauleitung, and Kreisleitung.   With respect to other staff officers and Party organizations   attached to the Leadership Corps other than the Amtsleiter   referred to above, the Tribunal will follow the suggestion of   the prosecution in excluding them from the declaration.There is no evidence in this case which shows that the office ofGaustellenleiter was the head of any office on the staff of theGauleitung.With regard to the SS the judgment of the International MilitaryTribunal is as follows:   The Tribunal declares to be criminal within the meaning of   the Charter the group composed of those persons who had been   officially accepted as members of the SS as enumerated in the   preceding paragraph who became or remained members of the   organization with knowledge that it was being used for the   commission of acts declared criminal by Article 6 of the Charter   * * *.[672]Referring back to the membership enumerated, the judgment declares:   In dealing with the SS, the Tribunal includes all persons who   had been officially accepted as members of the SS, including the   members of the Allgemeine SS, members of the Waffen SS, members   of the SS Totenkopf-Verbaende, and the members of any of the   different police forces who were members of the SS.[673]It is not believed by this Tribunal that a sponsoring membership isincluded in this definition.The Tribunal therefore finds the defendant Cuhorst not guilty undercounts two and four of the indictment.As to count three the problem is considerably more complicated.There are many affidavits and much testimony in the record as to thedefendants character as a fanatical Nazi and a ruthless judge. Thereis also much evidence as to the arbitrary, unfair, and unjudicialmanner in which he conducted his trials. Some of the evidence againsthim was weakened on cross-examination, but the general picture given ofhim as such a judge is one which the Tribunal accepts.The cases to be considered as connecting him with crimes establishedin this case under count three involve the question as to whether theevidence establishes his connection with the persecution of Poles. Inthis connection we have given particular consideration to the Skowronand Pietra cases.Unfortunately the records of the Special Court at Stuttgart weredestroyed at the time that the Palace of Justice in Stuttgart wasburned. There are therefore no records available as to the cases triedby Cuhorst.From the evidence available, this Tribunal does not consider that itcan say beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was guilty ofinflicting the punishments which he imposed on racial grounds or thatit can say beyond a reasonable doubt that he used the discriminatoryprovisions of the decree against Poles and Jews to the prejudice of thePoles whom he tried.While the defendant Cuhorst followed a misguided fanaticism, certainthings can be said in his favor. He was severely criticized for hisleniency by the defendant Klemm in a number of cases which he tried.He was tried by a Party court for statements considered to reflectupon the Party, which he made in a trial involving Party officials.Subsequently he was relieved as a judge in Stuttgart because heapparently did not conform to what the State and Party demanded of ajudge.This Tribunal does not consider itself commissioned to try theconscience of a man or to condemn a man merely for a course of conductforeign to its own conception of the law, it is limited to theevidence before it as to the commission of certain alleged offenses.Upon the evidence before it, it is the judgment of this Tribunal thatthe defendant Cuhorst has not been proved guilty beyond a reasonabledoubt of the crimes alleged and that he be, therefore, acquitted on thecharges against him.                        _THE DEFENDANT OESCHEY_The defendant Oeschey joined the NSDAP on 1 December 1931. He was warrepresentative for the Gau Main Office for legal aid and legal advice.After filling other offices he was appointed on 1 January 1939 tothe office of senior judge of the district court at Nuernberg, whichoffice he held until 1 April 1941. He was then appointed district courtdirector at the same court. He was a presiding judge of the SpecialCourt in Nuernberg.By decree of 30 July 1940 of the Reich legal office of the NSDAP, hewas provisionally commissioned with the direction of the legal officeof the NSDAP in the Franconia Gau, and the leadership of the FranconiaGau in the NSRB, the National Socialist Lawyers League. He carried outhis duties in the Leadership Corps of the Party at the same time thathe was serving as a judge of the Special Court. His personnel file inthe Reich Ministry of Justice shows that he was highly recommended forhis Party reliability by at least five different public officials.He was drafted into the army in February 1945, and remained in thearmy until the end of the war; however, he was released for the periodfrom 4 April until 14 April 1945, during which time he functionedas chairman of the civilian court martial at Nuernberg. The recorddiscloses that he and the defendant Rothaug were the guiding, if notcontrolling, spirits of the Special Court at Nuernberg, which was knownas the most brutal of the special courts in Germany.Among many cases which gave evidence of his arbitrary character we willgive detailed attention to two:In March 1943, Sofie Kaminska, a widowed Polish farm laborer, andWasyl Wdowen, a Ukrainian, were indicted before the Special Court atNuernberg for alleged crimes as follows:Kaminska for a violation of the law against Poles and Jews inconnection with the crime of assault and battery and threat andresistance to an officer; Wdowen for the alleged crime of beingaccessory to a crime according to the law against Poles and Jews,and for attempting to free a prisoner. The case was tried before theSpecial Court, the defendant Oeschey presiding.The facts on which the sentence was based may, with complete fairnessto the defendant Oeschey, be very briefly summarized. Shortly afterthe invasion of Poland, Kaminska came to Germany, being committed towork there. Kaminska and Wdowen were lovers. They were both workingfor a farmer, Gundel. They demanded pay from Gundel, which was refused,and they became more insistent. The defendant Wdowen actually gavethe farmer a push. In his distress Gundel called for help of thePfc. Anton Wanner who was in uniform and happened to be spending hisleave there. A quarrel followed. Kaminska slapped the soldiers face,and the soldier slapped her face. During the dispute the soldierscombat infantrymans badge fell to the ground. There were variousdemonstrations; the soldier drew his bayonet, and Kaminska ran out ofthe room and took a hoe, but did not get a chance to attack the soldierbecause he closed the door. Shortly thereafter, the soldier was ridingon his bicycle and the Pole, Kaminska, threw a stone at him without,however, hitting him. The next day a police official came out to thefarm and arrested Kaminska who followed him unwillingly. Wdowen,contrary to the instructions of the police officer, followed them.The policeman slapped Wdowens face twice to force him to turn back.Nevertheless, Wdowen followed to the door of the cell and attemptedto assist the Polish woman, Kaminska, in resisting imprisonment. Thevery most that can possibly be said of the evidence, as stated by thedefendant Oeschey himself, is that there was a good squabble withmutual recriminations and threats. It is to be understood that many ofthe statements heretofore made, as quoted from the opinion, were deniedby the defendants in that case but, as before stated, we do not retrythe case upon the facts. The court argues at great length concerningthe claim of the prosecution that the stone weighed a half a pound andshould be considered equal to a cutting or thrusting weapon. The courtsaid:   The defendant had the insolence to attack a German soldier; she   took up an offensive position which would have led to a great   blood bath if the soldier had not evaded the stone which was   hurled at him.The court said of Kaminska (_NG-457, Pros. Ex. 201_): She therebycharacterizes herself as a Polish violent criminal, and then stated:   As the defendant on 1 September 1939 was a resident in the   territory of the former Polish state, she had to be found   guilty, in application of paragraphs II, III, and XIV of the   Penal Law against Poles, of a crime of assault and battery in   coincidence with a crime of threat, a crime under paragraph 1,   section 1, of the law against violent criminals, and of a crime   of offering resistance to the authority of a state.The fact that the discriminatory law against Poles was invoked in thiscase is established. The opinion signed by Oeschey states:   Under paragraph III, section 2, of the Penal Law against Poles,   the death sentence must be passed if the law threatens with it.Concerning Wdowen, who was a Ukrainian and therefore could not besentenced under the law against Poles, the court commented on thefact that he knew that the Germany economy, on account of wartimeconditions, was dependent on foreign labor, in particular, labor fromthe eastern territories. The court drew the conclusion that Wdowen,who had used at most only a little force in attempting to protectKaminska, was guilty of having taken advantage of extraordinary wartimeconditions and of violating the law against violent criminals. Bothdefendants were sentenced to death by the defendant Oeschey. Theassociated judges in the Kaminska and Wdowen case were Doctors Gros andPfaff. They are guilty of having signed the judgment. Both submittedaffidavits and both were cross-examined before this Tribunal. Dr. Grosstated that Oeschey demanded the severest countermeasures in similarcases. We associate judges were powerless toward such an attitude. Itmust be mentioned that none of the defendants had criminal records, andthat they were eliminated in a most objectionable way by Oeschey forracial and political reasons.The other associate judge, Dr. Theodor Pfaff, spoke of the Kaminskacase as the most terrible of my entire career. * * * The sentence ofdeath and the consequent execution of these Poles offended my sense ofethics and has continually preyed upon my conscience. I would like tostate here that Oeschey forced his will upon us.The two associate judges are to be condemned for their spinelessattitude in submitting to the domination of the defendant Oeschey, butwe cannot fail to give weight to their statements, which in effectamount to confessions of their own wrongdoing.In this case Oeschey, with evil intent, participated in thegovernment-organized system for the racial persecution of Poles. Thisis also a case of such a perversion of the judicial process as to shockthe conscience of mankind.The progressive degeneration in the administration of justice came toa climax in 1944 and 1945. A decree by Thierack on 13 December 1944abrogated the rules concerning the obligatory representation of accusedpersons by defense counsel. It was left for the judge to decide whetherdefense counsel was required. On 15 February 1945 as a final measureof desperation and in the face of imminent defeat, the law was passedfor the establishment of civilian courts martial. The statute providedthat sentence should be either death, acquittal, or commitment to theregular court. Pursuant to this law Gauleiter Holz set up a drumheadcourt martial in Nuernberg. It consisted of the defendant Oescheyas presiding judge, with Gau Inspector Haberkern and a major in theWehrmacht as associate judges. On 2 April 1945 Karl Schroeder wasappointed prosecutor. The judges and prosecutor then went to the officeof the Gauleiter, where he delivered a speech in which he stated:   That the main point was to stop the American advance; one could   count upon introduction of new weapons, and that he expected   that the court martial would give the necessary support to the   army at the front by applying the severest measures.The officials were sworn in on 3 April. The affidavit of Schroeder, wholater appeared for cross-examination, discloses that Holz intended thatthe first case be tried on the third day of April. Schroeder statedthis would be impossible because he would need time to examine thecase. The first case to be tried was that of Count Montgelas. Schroederstates that the case was the most difficult in his practice, but thatit had to be tried because the Gauleitung pressed for a quick decisionof this matter. The defendant Oeschey testified concerning the courtmartial procedure as follows:   Proceedings were to follow the provisions laid down in the Code   of Criminal Procedure which had been very strongly simplified.   Nevertheless, the court martial had observed in its proceedings   the most important principles of protecting the interest of   the defendant. The defendants right to be heard, oral trial,   admission of defense counsel, thorough presentation of evidence,   a freedom of the judge to go into the evidence, a vote among the   judges, and so forth.The procedure followed by Oeschey as presiding judge in the caseMontgelas did not conform to the foregoing statement. Count Montgelashad for some time been represented by defense counsel Eichinger, whohad an office in the courthouse adjacent to that of the prosecutor, andwho had had dealings with the prosecutor concerning the Montgelas case.The defendant Oeschey testified that he had directed that Eichingerbe notified concerning the trial, but in any event Eichinger was notnotified and Oeschey informed the prosecutor that he would conduct thetrial without defense counsel because the legal prerequisites fortrial without defense counsel did exist. He apparently had referenceto Thieracks decree of 13 December 1944, _supra_.[674] Eichinger,as attorney for Count Montgelas, received his first informationconcerning the trial after Montgelas had been convicted and shot.The statute creating civilian courts martial specifically provided thatthey should consist of a judge of a criminal court, as president * **. At the time of his appointment, Oeschey was a soldier serving inthe Wehrmacht and was not a judge of a criminal court. He testifiedthat the statute meant only that it was necessary that a man beappointed who has the qualifications to exercise the function of ajudge.The Nuernberg civilian court martial functioned for the first time on5 April, held ten sessions, and disposed of twelve defendants, ten ofwhom were charged with political offenses. On 16 April the AmericanArmy was approaching Nuernberg, and on that date at noon the civiliancourt martial ceased to function.An exhibit was offered in evidence containing the results of anofficial investigation of the defendant Oeschey and prosecutorSchroeder for perversion of justice, conducted in August 1946, beforeGerman judicial authorities. An objection to the receipt of the exhibitwas first made by counsel for Oeschey but was later withdrawn. Theexhibit was received and is before us for consideration. From thisexhibit we learn that Dr. Wilhelm Eser was the investigating judgein the Montgelas case. He states that at the hearing of Montgelasa Gestapo official was present, and that if Montgelas had not beenarrested the official would have taken him back to the Gestapo as itwas demanded in the record of the investigation * * *. Eichinger,who appeared as a witness before this Tribunal, had been employed inFebruary by Countess Montgelas to defend her husband. He stated that hehad conferred with Prosecutor Dr. Mueller and had been informed thatthe prosecutor recognized--   * * * the competence of the Peoples Court and therefore he had   submitted the record of the case to the chief public prosecutor   at the Peoples Court for a decision. I asked him to inform   me immediately after the record was returned, respectively,   after receiving the decision of the chief public prosecutor. He   promised me this, and I was completely reassured.At this time Montgelas was in the sick ward of the prison for solitaryconfinement. On 10 April Eichinger went to the prison office toexamine the files in the Montgelas case, whereupon the director ofNuernberg prison informed me confidentially that Count Montgelas hadbeen summoned before the court martial on 5 April at 2 p.m., sentencedto death, and shot the next day. The crime for which Count Montgelashad been shot consisted of remarks made by him in a private room inthe Grand Hotel to a lady, Mrs. Pfleger, of Bamberg. The Count hadmade insulting remarks concerning Hitler, among others to the effectthat his true name was Schickelgruber. He also expressed approval ofthe attempt upon Hitlers life of 20 July 1944. We are convinced fromthe testimony of Eichinger before this Tribunal that if any seriouseffort had been made he could have been notified prior to the trial ofhis client. Eichinger expressed the opinion with which this Tribunalconcurs, that a summons issued at 1400 hours to appear at 1500 hoursbefore a court martial is an offense against justice. The only witnesswho appeared against Count Montgelas was an SS Fuehrer, who had beenshadowing him for many days in an attempt to secure evidence againsthim. By concealing himself in an adjoining room and by the use of amechanical device, he was able to overhear the conversation betweenMontgelas and the lady and to testify concerning it. Eichinger statesthat the statements of the SS Fuehrer who was the eavesdropper atthe hotel were in important points contradictory to the statementsMontgelas had made to his attorney and that the latter had alreadyproposed to summon the lady with whom Montgelas had conversed as arebuttal witness in behalf of the Count.The wife of the martyr Montgelas stated in the official investigationthat Chief Prosecutor Schroeder told her that there had not been timeto comply with my husbands urgent request to get a defense counsel.Schroeder also told the Countess that she was not to be given anyinformation on the disposal of the body of her husband because he haddied a dishonorable death. Thus, on the last days of the war, when theAmerican Army was almost at the gates of Nuernberg, and within a monthof the total collapse of German opposition, a sick man, after solitaryconfinement, is indicted on 3 April, tried on 5 April, and shot on 6April without the knowledge of his counsel in secret proceedings, andwithout the benefit of witnesses who would have testified for him. Sucha mock trial is not a judicial proceeding but a murder.It is provided in C. C. Law 10 that persecutions on political as wellas racial grounds are recognized as crimes. While the mere fact alonethat Montgelas was prosecuted for remarks hostile to the Nazi regimemay not constitute a violation of C. C. Law 10, the circumstances underwhich the defendant was brought to trial and the manner in which he wastried convince us that Montgelas was not convicted for undermining thealready collapsed defensive strength of the defeated nation, but on thecontrary, that the law was deliberately invoked by Gauleiter Holz andenforced by Oeschey as a last vengeful act of political persecution. Ifthe provisions of C. C. Law 10 do not cover this case, we do not knowwhat kind of political persecution it would cover.We have already indicated that we will not convict any defendant merelybecause of the fact, without more, that he participated in the passingor enforcement of laws for the punishment of habitual criminals,looters, hoarders, or those guilty of undermining the defensivestrength of the nation, but we also stated that these laws were in manyinstances applied in an arbitrary and brutal manner shocking to theconscience of mankind and punishable here. This was the situation in anumber of cases tried by Rothaug and Oeschey, but concerning which wehave no transcript of testimony and we must therefore of necessity relyupon statements of associates and close observers. In this connectionwe shall have reference to affidavits and to testimony of associates ofthe defendant Oeschey. We shall refer to statements of affiants only inthose cases in which the affiant was also brought to court and verballycross-examined concerning his statements.Dr. Hermann Mueller was a prosecutor at the Special Court in Nuernberg.He said:   He (Oeschey) frequently insulted the defendants and presented   the crimes to them as if these crimes were already a proven   fact. His behavior was often so extreme that one might well   believe he was a psychopathic case. The abusive insults that   he inflicted upon the defendants were, to the highest degree,   unworthy of a court trial. He wielded such influence over the   form of the administration of justice through his close Party   affiliations that the other officials of equal rank at the   Nuernberg administration of criminal justice were almost always   forced to yield.Mueller mentions several cases in which Oeschey announced before trialthat the defendant would be executed. In a case against Schnaus hestates that Oeschey--   * * * told me that, as a result of a discussion with government   officials, he was certain to obtain the death sentence. At that   time I was still unaware of the changed situation at the Special   Court occasioned by the war, and turned to my immediate superior   for information. He then informed me of the very close relations   existing between judges and the prosecutors.Concerning the case Montgelas, Mueller stated:   Concerning the case of Montgelas it must be pointed out that   this was a case of political extermination, which was handled in   a most hideous fashion.Again, he said:   Oeschey was the most brutal judge that I have ever known in   my life and a most willing instrument of the Nazi terroristic   justice.Dr. Armin Baur was the medical officer at the Special Court. He said:   One always had the impression that the verdict was already   previously decided upon and that Oeschey and Rothaug were just   playing cat and mouse with the defendants for hours. No occasion   was missed to insult the defendants in the filthiest way.This medical expert dealt with cases which were tried both by Rothaugand by Oeschey. In the Katzenberger case the defendant Rothaug told thedoctor that he wanted the defendant examined but that the examinationwas a matter of pure formality because the Jew would be beheadedanyhow, and he added, It is sufficient for me that the swine saidthat a German girl sat on his lap. Dr. Baur states that foreignerswere generally dealt with by Rothaug and Oeschey as inferior beingswhose task it was only to serve the German master race.Hans Kern, defense counsel, stated that foreigners were told at thebeginning and throughout the trial that they were to be annihilated.Again he said:   Rothaug and Oeschey declined, as a matter of principle, to   believe Polish citizens who were under accusation. They were   branded as liars. It was assumed that their innate tendency made   liars of them.    He described Oeschey as a notorious Pole baiter.Dr. Gustav Kunz, leading court doctor at Nuernberg, was an excellentand reliable witness. He stated:   Insult, humiliation, and mental torture of the defendants   were routine and the two judges, especially Oeschey, did not   even renounce them in cases in which--according to the legal   situation--the verdict had to be and actually was acquittal or   an insignificant sentence.Kurt Hoffmann, prosecutor at Nuernberg, states that Oeschey was severeas to the German defendants and was--   * * * even more severe with regard to sentences against   foreigners and much more furious in his conduct of their trials,   especially in the case of Poles.Adolf Paulus, former public prosecutor, speaks of the brutality ofwhich only Oeschey was capable.Friedrich Doebig, who was president of the district court of appeals atNuernberg, later senate president of the Reich Supreme Court, statedthat Oeschey like Rothaug was a fanatical Nazi, who consistentlyinterpreted and enforced the law in accord with Nazi ideologies.Dr. Herbert Lipps served with defendant Oeschey on the Special Court,Nuernberg. He states that Oeschey was autocratic and would not toleratecontradiction.   Defendants were insulted by Oeschey in the most abusive manner   and death candidates were told by Oeschey right at the beginning   of the session that they had forfeited their lives.   Toward foreigners, particularly Poles, Oeschey was especially   rigorous and here upheld the National Socialist theory of   liquidating where nationals of the occupied territories were   concerned. I remember a case in which a Polish farmhand was   ill-treated by his employer and defended himself. Oeschey told   the defendant that a Pole was not allowed to oppose a German.Dr. Franz Gros was an associate judge at Nuernberg. He states thatOeschey followed the harsh procedural methods of Rothaug and was afanatic National Socialist who pursued his dishonorable motives withconviction and who willingly lent his hand to blood-thirsty NationalSocialist jurisdiction.Dr. Pfaff was an associate judge at Nuernberg and corroborates thestatements of Dr. Gros.Dr. Joseph Mayer was a Referent in the prosecutors office atNuernberg. Concerning Oeschey, he said:   Oeschey * * * was obviously of Rothaugs school. Outwardly he   gave the impression of being morose and unrelenting. I cannot   remember ever having had a personal conversation with him. As   a rule he began the proceedings with a preconceived opinion   to which he adhered. Anyone who tried to oppose this opinion   was overridden by him in the most brutal way. He insulted the   defendants all the time in a most offensive manner, informing   them repeatedly all the way through, what he intended to do with   them. He had an extensive vocabulary of invectives for that   purpose, the use of which he developed to a fine art. * * * It   was literally tormenting if one had to listen to this tirade   often for hours at a time. When his face became distorted into a   repulsive mask by his continual scolding and abusive language,   Fausts words to Mephistopheles would often quite involuntarily   come to my mind: Thou freak of filth and fire.Joseph Eichinger, defense attorney at Nuernberg, stated:   His prejudice was so strong that he did not consider,   seriously, the statements of the defense and dismissed them   rudely or ironically. Even during the trial he repeatedly   addressed the defendant thus: People such as you deserve to   be exterminated, You will be convicted; or he called the   defendant insulting and humiliating names such as criminal, or   scoundrel, enemy of the people.Again, he said:   As leader of the Gau legal office (Gaurechtsamt) and, after the   latters disbanding, as member in the Gau staff (Gaustab), he   enjoyed a special position of power which enabled him to hold   the defense strongly in check; it was well known that a sign   from the Gau authorities, instigated by Oeschey, was sufficient   to have a lawyer turned over to the Gestapo.   I had the impression that he supported, knowingly and   willingly, the policy of Hitler to decimate (Dezimierung)   aliens, especially Poles, by increasing the number of death   sentences against them * * *.On cross-examination Eichinger admitted that he did not know of anylawyer who had been turned over to the Gestapo by Oeschey. It isclear that in his statements Eichinger was relying only upon generalinformation as the basis of his opinion. We think, however, that hisopinion merits consideration.Dr. Karl Mayer, defense counsel, said that Rothaug was judge of theworst Special Court in Germany and used to tell defendants evenduring the trial that they would be exterminated. He adds that afterRothaug was transferred to Berlin, Oeschey even surpassed him in thespitefulness of his manner. Space does not permit the discussionof the other cases which illustrate Oescheys ruthless exercise ofarbitrary power. Mention should, however, be made of the trial of agroup of foreign boys who had some fights with boys in the NuernbergHitler Youth Home. Dr. Mueller characterizes the action of the boys asharmless pranks. At worst they were indulging in street fights with theHitler Youth. Oeschey held that they constituted a resistance movementand several of the boys were sentenced to death.The defendant Oeschey is charged under count four of the indictmentwith being a member of the Party Leadership Corps at Gau level withinthe definition of the membership declared criminal according to thejudgment of the first International Military Tribunal in the caseagainst Goering, et al.We have previously quoted the findings of the first InternationalMilitary Tribunal which define the organizations and groups withinthe Leadership Corps which are declared to be criminal. Oeschey wasprovisionally commissioned with the direction of the legal office ofthe NSDAP in the Franconia Gau and served in that official capacity fora long time. In his testimony he states that from 1940 to 1942 he wassolely in charge of the Gau legal office as section chief. The evidenceclearly establishes the defendants voluntary membership as the chiefof a Gau staff office subsequent to 1 September 1939. The judgment ofthe first International Military Tribunal lists among the criminalactivities of the Party Leadership Corps the following:   The Leadership Corps played its part in the persecution   of the Jews. It was involved in the economic and political   discrimination against the Jews which was put into effect   shortly after the Nazis came into power. The Gestapo and SD were   instructed to coordinate with the Gauleiter and Kreisleiter the   measures taken in the pogroms of 9 and 10 November 1938. The   Leadership Corps was also used to prevent German public opinion   from reacting against the measures taken against the Jews in the   East. On 9 October 1942, a confidential information bulletin   was sent to all Gauleiter and Kreisleiter entitled Preparatory   measures for the final solution of the Jewish question in   Europe--rumors concerning the conditions of the Jews in the   East. This bulletin stated that rumors were being started by   returning soldiers concerning the conditions of Jews in the East   which some Germans might not understand, and outlined in detail   the official explanation to be given. This bulletin contained no   explicit statement that the Jews were being exterminated, but   it did indicate they were going to labor camps, and spoke of   their complete segregation and elimination and the necessity of   ruthless severity. * * *   The Leadership Corps played an important part in the   administration of the slave labor program. A Sauckel decree   dated 6 April 1942 appointed the Gauleiter as plenipotentiary   for labor mobilization for their Gaue with authority to   coordinate all agencies dealing with labor questions in their   Gaue, with specific authority over the employment of foreign   workers, including their conditions of work, feeding, and   housing. Under this authority the Gauleiter assumed control over   the allocation of labor in their Gaue, including the forced   laborers from foreign countries. In carrying out this task the   Gauleiter used many Party offices within their Gaue, including   subordinate political leaders. For example, Sauckels decree of   8 September 1942, relating to the allocation for household labor   of 400,000 women laborers brought in from the East, established   a procedure under which applications filed for such workers   should be passed on by the Kreisleiter, whose judgment was final.   Under Sauckels directive the Leadership Corps was directly   concerned with the treatment given foreign workers, and the   Gauleiter were specifically instructed to prevent politically   inept factory heads from giving too much consideration to the   care of eastern workers. * * *   The Leadership Corps was directly concerned with the treatment   of prisoners of war. On 5 November 1941 Bormann transmitted a   directive down to the level of Kreisleiter instructing them to   insure compliance by the army with the recent directives of the   department of the interior ordering that dead Russian prisoners   of war should be buried wrapped in tar paper in a remote place   without any ceremony or any decorations of their graves. On 25   November 1943 Bormann sent a circular instructing the Gauleiter   to report any lenient treatment of prisoners of war. On 13   September 1944 Bormann sent a directive down to the level of   Kreisleiter ordering that liaison be established between the   Kreisleiter and the guards of the prisoners of war in order   better to assimilate the commitment of the prisoners of war to   the political and economic demands. * * *   The machinery of the Leadership Corps was also utilized in   attempts made to deprive Allied airmen of the protection to   which they were entitled under the Geneva Convention. On 13   March 1940 a directive of Hess, transmitted instructions through   the Leadership Corps down to the Blockleiter for the guidance of   the civilian population in case of the landing of enemy planes   or parachutists, which stated that enemy parachutists were to be   immediately arrested or made harmless.[675]As to his knowledge, the defendant Oeschey joined the NSDAP on 1December 1931. He was head of the Lawyers League for the Gau Franconiaand a judicial officer of considerable importance within the Gau. Theseoffices would provide additional sources of information as to thecrimes outlined. Furthermore, these crimes were of such wide scope andso intimately connected with the activities of the Gauleitung that itwould be impossible for a man of the defendants intelligence not tohave known of the commission of these crimes, at least in part if notentirely.We find the defendant Oeschey guilty under counts three and four ofthe indictment. In view of the sadistic attitude and conduct of thedefendant, we know of no just reason for any mitigation of punishment.                      _THE DEFENDANT ALTSTOETTER_Joseph Altstoetter was born 4 January 1892. He was educated for thebar and passed the State examination in jurisprudence in Munich. Hesubsequently served in the Bavarian and in the Reich Ministries ofJustice.In 1932 he was promoted and sent to the Reich Supreme Court in Leipzig.In 1933 he was a member of the appeals criminal senate. In 1936 hewas a member of the Reich Labor Court. From 1939 to 1943 he servedwith the Wehrmacht. In 1943 he was assigned to the Reich Ministry ofJustice where he was made chief of the civil law and procedure divisionin the Ministry of Justice with the title of Ministerialdirektor andserved in that capacity until the surrender. He had been a member ofthe Stahlhelm prior to the Nazi rise to power. When the Stahlhelm wasabsorbed into the Nazi organization, he automatically became a memberof the SA. Prior to May 1937 he resigned from the SA to become a memberof the general SS. His membership in the SS, from his personnel files,dates from 15 May 1937. He applied for membership in the NSDAP in 1938and his membership was dated back to 1 May 1937. He was awarded theGolden Party Badge for service to the Party.Upon the evidence in this case it is the judgment of this Tribunal thatthe defendant Altstoetter is not guilty under counts two and three ofthe indictment.The question which remains to be determined as to the defendantAltstoetter is whether, knowing of its criminal activities as definedby the London Charter, he joined or retained membership in the SS, anorganization defined as criminal by the International Military Tribunalin the case of Goering, et al.The evidence in this case as to his connection with the SS is foundprimarily in his personnel record which covers a great many pages, inhis correspondence with SS leaders, and his own testimony. From thisevidence it appears that the defendant, upon the request of Himmler,joined the SS in May 1937. He stated that Himmler told him he wouldreceive a rank commensurate with his civil status. The record doesnot indicate what rank in the SS was commensurate with his civilstatus as a member of the Reich Supreme Court, but on 20 April 1938he was promoted to Untersturmfuehrer, which corresponds to a secondlieutenant in the army. He was subsequently promoted on 20 April 1939to Obersturmfuehrer; on 20 April 1940 to Hauptsturmfuehrer. On 12 March1943, according to a letter to the SS Main Personnel Office, signedby Himmler, he was promoted to Sturmbannfuehrer, effective 25 January1943 and, by the same letter, to Obersturmbannfuehrer as of 20 April1943, and it was directed that he be issued a skull and crossbonesring. In June 1943 he wrote to the Chief of the SS Main Office, SSGruppenfuehrer Berger, thanking him for this ring bestowed by the ReichLeader SS. In this letter he wrote:   Both this promotion and the honoring of this decoration with   the skull and crossbone ring I will take not only as a token of   the Reich Leaders most distinct proof of trust in me, but also   as an incentive for further active proof of my loyalty and for   strictest adherence to my duties in my career as an SS man.On 11 February 1944 he wrote SS Gruppenfuehrer and Lieutenant Generalof the Waffen SS, Professor Dr. Karl Gebhardt, a letter containing thefollowing paragraph:   One more personal remark--You kindly promoted me SS   Oberfuehrer. It is not that far yet. At least, I did not get to   know it until now. I merely tell you this because I do not want   to claim anything for me which does not correspond to facts.By letter dated 16 June 1944 he was notified that the Reich Leader SShad promoted him to the rank of Oberfuehrer, effective 21 June 1944.The defendant stated that he was assigned to the legal staff of the48th Standarte and later to the legal staff of the SS Main Office.He stated that he had no actual duties. However, part of his servicecredentials, dated 14 March 1939, under the heading of qualifications,signed by Dalski, SS Obersturmbannfuehrer, the following is stated:   SS Untersturmfuehrer Altstoetter is frank, honest, and helpful.   His ideology is firmly established on a National Socialist   basis. A. was a leader of the staff of the 48th Standarte and   there at all times performed his duties in a satisfactory   manner.In a report from Leipzig, dated 10 June 1939, it is stated that he wasawarded the badge of honor for legal service, in silver, effective 19April 1938, signed Sachse, SS Untersturmfuehrer and Adjutant.The defendant was evidently highly regarded by Himmler who, on 18September 1942, at a meeting with Thierack and Rothenberger, referredto him as a reliable SS Obersturmfuehrer.It also appears that his appointment to the Ministry of Justice was atthe suggestion of Himmler and that the defendants relationship withHimmler was one which Thierack fostered for purposes of his own.At the instance of Thierack, he visited Himmler at his headquarters andwas present at a speech given by Himmler at Kochem, where he attended adinner for twelve people, including SS Standartenfuehrer Rudolf Brandtand SS Obergruppenfuehrer Pohl.He visited Berger, a high SS official, at Bergers request. Hecarried on considerable correspondence with high officials in theSS, including Himmler, SS Gruppenfuehrer Professor Dr. Gebhardt, SSGruppenfuehrer Berger, and Kaltenbrunner, Chief of the Security Policeand SD.On 25 May 1940 Altstoetter wrote to the Reich Leader SS as follows:   If I can contribute my small part towards helping our Fuehrer   to accomplish his great task for the benefit of our nation, this   causes me particular joy and satisfaction, especially in my   capacity as SS officer.According to a letter to Gebhardt, Himmler had instructed the SSleaders to request Altstoetters advice in certain matters.On 6 June 1944 he wrote Gebhardt, congratulating him upon a recentaward. In this letter he states:   I am especially glad about your distinction, especially because   I do not see only in it a recognition of your great war service   as a physician and surgeon but also as a research scientist and   organizer and which is attributed to our old and trusty friend.The evidence in this case clearly establishes that the defendant joinedand retained his membership in the SS on a voluntary basis. In fact itappears that he took considerable interest in his SS rank and honors.The remaining fact to be determined is whether he had knowledge ofthe criminal activities of the SS as defined in the London Charter.In this connection we quote certain extracts from the judgment of theInternational Military Tribunal in the case of Goering, et al., as tothe SS--   Criminal activities: SS units were active participants in   the steps leading up to aggressive war. The Verfuegungstruppe   was used in the occupation of the Sudetenland, of Bohemia and   Moravia, and in Memel. The Henlein Free Corps was under the   jurisdiction of the Reich Leader SS for operations in the   Sudetenland in 1938, and the Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle financed   fifth column activities there.   The SS was even a more general participant in the commission   of war crimes and crimes against humanity. Through its control   over the organization of the police, particularly the Security   Police and SD, the SS was involved in all the crimes which   have been outlined in the section of this judgment dealing   with the Gestapo and SD. * * * The Race and Settlement Office   of the SS, together with the Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle were   active in carrying out schemes for Germanization of occupied   territories according to the racial principles of the Nazi Party   and were involved in the deportation of Jews and other foreign   nationals. Units of the Waffen SS and Einsatzgruppen operating   directly under the SS Main Office were used to carry out these   plans. These units were also involved in the widespread murder   and ill-treatment of the civilian population of occupied   territories. * * *   From 1934 onward the SS was responsible for the guarding and   administration of concentration camps. The evidence leaves no   doubt that the consistently brutal treatment of the inmates of   concentration camps was carried out as a result of the general   policy of the SS, which was that the inmates were racial   inferiors to be treated only with contempt. There is evidence   that where manpower considerations permitted, Himmler wanted to   rotate guard battalions so that all members of the SS would be   instructed as to the proper attitude to take to inferior races.   After 1942 when the concentration camps were placed under the   control of the WVHA they were used as a source of slave labor.   An agreement made with the Ministry of Justice on 18 September   1942 provided that antisocial elements who had. finished prison   sentences were to be delivered to the SS to be worked to death.   * * *   The SS played a particularly significant role in the   persecution of the Jews. The SS was directly involved in the   demonstrations of 10 November 1938. The evacuation of the   Jews from occupied territories was carried out under the   directions of the SS with the assistance of SS police units. The   extermination of the Jews was carried out under the direction of   the SS central organizations. It was actually put into effect by   SS formations. * * *   It is impossible to single out any one portion of the SS which   was not involved in these criminal activities. The Allgemeine SS   was an active participant in the persecution of the Jews and was   used as a source of concentration camp guards. * * *   The Tribunal finds that knowledge of these criminal activities   was sufficiently general to justify declaring that the SS was   a criminal organization to the extent hereinafter described.   It does appear that an attempt was made to keep secret some   phases of its activities, but its criminal programs were so   widespread, and involved slaughter on such a gigantic scale,   that its criminal activities must have been widely known. It   must be recognized, moreover, that the criminal activities of   the SS followed quite logically from the principles on which   it was organized. Every effort had been made to make the SS   a highly disciplined organization composed of the elite of   national socialism. Himmler had stated that there were people   in Germany who become sick when they see these black coats,   and that he did not expect that they should be loved by too   many. * * * Himmler in a series of speeches made in 1943,   indicated his pride in the ability of the SS to carry out these   criminal acts. He encouraged his men to be tough and ruthless;   he spoke of shooting thousands of leading Poles, and thanked   them for their cooperation and lack of squeamishness at the   sight of hundreds and thousands of corpses of their victims. He   extolled ruthlessness in exterminating the Jewish race and later   described this process as delousing. These speeches show that   the general attitude prevailing in the SS was consistent with   these criminal acts. * * *   In dealing with the SS the Tribunal includes all persons who   had been officially accepted as members of the SS, including the   members of the Allgemeine SS, members of the Waffen SS, members   of the SS Totenkopf Verbaende, and the members of any of the   different police forces who were members of the SS. * * *   The Tribunal declares to be criminal within the meaning of   the Charter the group composed of those persons who had been   officially accepted as members of the SS as enumerated in the   preceding paragraph who became or remained members of the   organization with knowledge that it was being used for the   commission of acts declared criminal by article 6 of the Charter   * * *.[676]In this regard the Tribunal is of the opinion that the activities ofthe SS and the crimes which it committed as pointed out by the judgmentof the International Military Tribunal above quoted are of so wide ascope that no person of the defendants intelligence, and one who hadachieved the rank of Oberfuehrer in the SS, could have been unaware ofits illegal activities, particularly a member of the organization from1937 until the surrender. According to his own statement, he joined theSS with misgivings, not only on religious grounds but also because ofpractices of the police as to protective custody in concentration camps.Altstoetter not only had contacts with the high ranking officialsof the SS, as above stated, but was himself a high official in theMinistry of Justice stationed in Berlin from June 1943 until thesurrender. He attended conferences of the department chiefs in theMinistry of Justice and was necessarily associated with the officialsof the Ministry, including those in charge of penal matters.The record in this case shows as part of the defense of many ofthose on trial here that they claim to have constantly resisted theencroachment of the police under Himmler and the illegal acts of thepolice.Documentary evidence shows that the defendant knew of the evacuation ofJews in Austria and had correspondence with the Chief of the SecurityPolice and Security Service regarding witnesses for the hereditarybiological courts. This correspondence states:   If the Residents Registration Office or another police office   gives the information that a Jew has been deported, all other   inquiries as to his place of abode as well as applications for   his admission of hearing or examination are superfluous. On the   contrary, it has to be assumed that the Jew is not attainable   for the taking of evidence.It also quotes this significant paragraph:   If in an individual case it is to the interest of the public   to make an exception and to render possible the taking of   evidence by special provision of persons to accompany and means   of transportation for the Jew, a report has to be submitted   to me in which the importance of the case is explained. In   all cases offices must refrain from direct application to the   offices of the police, especially also to the Central Office for   the Regulation of the Jewish Problem in Bohemia and Moravia at   Prague, for information on the place of abode of deported Jews   and their admission, hearing, or examination.He was a member of the SS at the time of the pogroms in November 1938,Crystal Week, in which the IMT found the SS to have had an importantpart. Surely whether or not he took a part in such activities orapproved of them, he must have known of that part which was played byan organization of which he was an officer. As a lawyer he knew that inOctober of 1940 the SS was placed beyond reach of the law. As a lawyerhe certainly knew that by the thirteenth amendment to the citizenshiplaw the Jews were turned over to the police and so finally deprived ofthe scanty legal protection they had theretofore had. He also knew,for it was part of the same law, of the sinister provisions for theconfiscation of property upon death of the Jewish owners, by the police.Notwithstanding these facts, he maintained his friendly relations withthe leaders of the SS, including Himmler, Kaltenbrunner, Gebhardt, andBerger. He refers to Himmler, one of the most sinister figures in theThird Reich, as his old and trusty friend. He accepted and retainedhis membership in the SS, perhaps the major instrument of Himmlerspower. Conceding that the defendant did not know of the ultimate massmurders in the concentration camps and by the Einsatzgruppen, he knewthe policies of the SS and, in part, its crimes. Nevertheless heaccepted its insignia, its rank, its honors, and its contacts with thehigh figures of the Nazi regime. These were of no small significance inNazi Germany. For that price he gave his name as a soldier and a juristof note and so helped to cloak the shameful deeds of that organizationfrom the eyes of the German people.Upon the evidence in this case it is the judgment of this Tribunal thatthe defendant Altstoetter is guilty under count four of the indictment.This Tribunal has held that it has no jurisdiction to try any defendantfor the crime of conspiracy as a separate substantive offense, but werecognize that there are allegations in count one of the indictmentwhich constitute charges of direct commission of war crimes and crimesagainst humanity. However, after eliminating the conspiracy chargefrom count one, we find that all other alleged criminal acts thereinset forth and committed after 1 September 1939 are also charged ascrimes in the subsequent counts of the indictment. We therefore find itunnecessary to pass formally upon the remaining charges in count one.Our pronouncements of guilt or innocence under counts two, three, andfour dispose of all issues which have been submitted to us.Concerning those defendants who have been found guilty, our conclusionsare not based solely upon the facts which we have set forth in theseparate discussions of the individual defendants. In the course of9 months devoted to the trial and consideration of this case, wehave reached conclusions based upon evidence and observation of thedefendants which cannot fully be documented within the limitations oftime and space allotted to us. As we have said, the defendants arenot charged with specific overt acts against named victims. They arecharged with criminal participation in government-organized atrocitiesand persecutions unmatched in the annals of history. Our judgments arebased upon a consideration of all of the evidence which tends to throwlight upon the part which these defendants played in the entire tragicdrama. We shall, in pronouncing sentence, give due consideration tocircumstances of mitigation and to the proven character and motives ofthe respective defendants.                                          [Signed] JAMES T. BRAND                                                   Presiding Judge                                                   MALLORY B. BLAIR                                                   Judge                                                   JUSTIN W. HARDING                                                   Judge                 VIII. SEPARATE OPINION BY JUDGE BLAIR                 OPINION OF MALLORY B. BLAIR, JUDGE OF                         MILITARY TRIBUNAL IIII concur in the final judgment and verdict filed herein, which I havesigned. A difference of view has arisen, however, with respect tocertain findings and conclusions made in the judgment under the titleSource of Authority of Control Council Law No. 10. Under this titlea lengthy and able discussion is made in the judgment concerning theeffect and meaning of the term unconditional surrender of Germany tothe Allied Powers. From the meaning given to the term of unconditionalsurrender of the armed forces of the Hitler regime and the collapseof his totalitarian government in Germany, the view is expressed thata distinction arises between measures taken by the Allied Powers priorto the destruction of the German Government and those taken afterwards;and that only the former may be tested by the Hague Regulationsbecause they relate only to a belligerent occupation. To support thisview, quotations are made from articles expressing views of certaintext writers, which articles are published in the American Journal ofInternational Law. The judgment then adopts the view expressed in thequoted texts, which is admittedly contrary to the views of the equallyscholarly writers whose articles are also cited.The foregoing decision is made to depend upon a determination of thepresent character or status of the occupation of Germany by the AlliedPowers; that is, whether or not it is a belligerent occupation. Thisinteresting but academic discussion of the question has no possiblerelation to or connection with the source of authority of ControlCouncil Law No. 10, which is the question posed in the judgment. Noauthority or jurisdiction to determine the question of the presentstatus of belligerency of the occupation of Germany has been giventhis Tribunal. This question of present belligerency of occupationrests solely within the jurisdiction of the military occupants andthe executives of the nations which the members of the Allied ControlCouncil represent. The determination by this Tribunal that the presentoccupation of Germany by the Allied Powers is not belligerent maypossibly involve serious complications with respect to matters solelywithin the jurisdiction of the military and executive departments ofthe governments of the Allied Powers.If, however, any possible questions are here present for determinationwith respect to (1) the character of the present status of occupationof Germany; and (2) the present status of belligerency, such questionscan only relate to the rights of the victorious belligerent to exercisecontrol over Germany. Such matters as regard the American Zone arecontrolled by both the written and unwritten laws, rules, and customsof warfare and by the rights and obligations of a victorious occupantunder international law. The determination of these matters has notbeen entrusted to this Tribunal. This Tribunal has not been givenany jurisdiction to exercise any sovereign power of Germany; norhas it been given any jurisdiction to determine that because of theunconditional surrender Germanys sovereignty was thereby transferredto the victorious Allied Powers. These matters are controlled in theAmerican Zone by the Basic Field Manual [27-10] on Rules of LandWarfare issued (1940) by The Judge Advocate General of the UnitedStates Army.As concerns questions of transfer of sovereignty of a defeatedbelligerent to the victorious belligerent, the foregoing rules of landwarfare provide--   _273. Does not transfer sovereignty._--Being an incident   of war, military occupation confers upon the invading force   the right to exercise control for the period of occupation.   It does not transfer the sovereignty to the occupant, but   simply the authority or power to exercise some of the rights   of sovereignty. The exercise of these rights results from the   established power of the occupant and from the necessity for   maintaining law and order, indispensable to both the inhabitants   and to the occupying force.   _274. Distinguished from invasion._--The state of   invasion corresponds with the period of resistance. Invasion   is not necessarily occupation, although it precedes it and   may frequently coincide with it. An invader may push rapidly   through a large portion of enemy country without establishing   that effective control which is essential to the status of   occupation. He may send small raiding parties or flying columns,   reconnoitering detachments, etc., into or through a district   where they may be temporarily located and exercise control, yet   when they pass on it cannot be said that such district is under   his military occupation.   _275. Distinguished from subjugation or   conquest._--Military occupation in a foreign war, being   based upon the fact of possession of _enemy_ territory,   necessarily implies that the sovereignty of the occupied   territory is not vested in the occupying power. The occupation   is essentially provisional.   On the other hand, subjugation or conquest implies a transfer   of sovereignty. Ordinarily, however, such transfer is effected   by a treaty of peace. When sovereignty passes, military   occupation, as such, must of course cease; although the   territory may, and usually does for a period at least, continue   to be governed through military agencies which have such powers   as the President or Congress may prescribe.And as concerns the administration of occupied territory, the samerules of land warfare require--   _285. The laws in force._--The principal object of the   occupant is to provide for the security of the invading army   and to contribute to its support and efficiency and the success   of its operations. In restoring public order and safety he   will continue in force the ordinary civil and criminal laws of   the occupied territory which do not conflict with this object.   These laws will be administered by the local officials as far   as practicable. All crimes not of a military nature and which   do not affect the safety of the invading army are left to the   jurisdiction of the local courts.   _286. Power to suspend and promulgate laws._--The military   occupant may suspend existing laws and promulgate new ones when   the exigencies of the military service demand such action.Manifestly this Tribunal, created for the sole purpose of trying andpunishing war criminals in the broadest sense of that term as usedin Control Council Law No. 10, has not by such law been given anyjurisdiction to determine matters relating to the far reaching poweror authority which the foregoing rules authorize a military occupantto exercise provisionally. In consequence, the lengthy discussionof the far reaching power or authority which the Allied Powers arenow exercising in Germany has no material relation to any questionbefore us for determination, and particularly the question of thesource of the authority of Control Council Law No. 10. Certainlythis Tribunal has no jurisdiction to determine whether or not themilitary or executive authorities have exceeded their authority orwhether or not they are exercising in fact the sovereign authority ofGermany, or whether by her unconditional surrender Germany has lost allsovereignty. The exercise of such powers has to do with provisionalmatters of occupation and operates presently and in future. Ourjurisdiction extends to the trial of war criminals for crimes committedduring the war and before the unconditional surrender of Germany. Thisjurisdiction is determined by entirely different laws.Under the foregoing rules of military operation there is no rule whichwould, because of the unconditional surrender of the German armedforces, transfer the sovereignty of Germany to the Allied occupants,or to either of them, in their respective zones of occupation. Itmay here be pointed out that the report of 1919 by the Commission onResponsibility of the Authors of War and Enforcement of Penalties listsamong other war crimes in violation of international law or of the lawsand customs of land warfare,(10) the usurpation of sovereignty duringmilitary occupation. This rule is incident to military occupationand was clearly intended to protect the inhabitants of any occupiedterritory against the unnecessary exercise of sovereignty by a militaryoccupant. As concerns this Military Tribunal in the American Zone ofOccupation, the problem is dealt with and concluded by the above-quotedrules (285286), relating to administration of occupied territory.No attempt has been made by the Allied Powers, or either of them, toexercise the sovereign authority of Germany, except in the limitedsense provided for by the foregoing rules of land warfare. On 30January 1946 the Allied Control Council enacted Law No. 11 whichrepealed most of the enactments of the Nazi regime and continued inforce in all of Germany the great body of criminal law contained inthe German Criminal Code of 1871 with amendments thereto. This is inaccord with the provisions of the above-quoted rule 285. Thus in theAmerican Zone there has been continued in force the ordinary civil andcriminal laws of the German states, each of which has been recognizedas a sovereign power. These laws are being administered by Germanlocal and state officials as far as can practicably be done, with theavowed intention of the Allied Powers, and each of them, to surrenderall powers now exercised as a military occupant, particularly when theall-Nazi militaristic influence in public, private, and cultured lifeof Germany has been destroyed, and when Nazi war criminals have beenpunished as they justly deserve to be punished.Furthermore, as concerns the American Zone of Occupation, thepunishment of war leaders or criminals is being and will be carried outby four separate procedures--(1) Major German war leaders or criminals are tried by this and similarmilitary tribunals set up under Control Council Law No. 10 and MilitaryGovernment Ordinance No. 7, limited to the crimes or offenses thereindefined or recognized.(2) The trials of Germans for the commission of war crimes againstAmerican military personnel and for atrocities or crimes committed inconcentration camps in the area captured or occupied by the Americanarmed forces, are tried by special military courts set up at thedirection of the zone commander, with the theater judge advocate incharge of the prosecution of the cases.(3) Germans who are charged with committing crimes against humanityupon other Germans, in violation of German law, are tried by theordinary German criminal courts.(4) Other Germans who were actively responsible for the crimes of theHitler or Nazi regime, or who actively participated in the Nazi plansor schemes, are tried by German tribunals under the Law for Liberationfrom National Socialism and Militarism of 5 March 1946.The purpose of the foregoing program is to carry out the objectives ofthe Potsdam Agreement that war criminals and those participating inplanning or carrying out Nazi enterprises involving or resulting inatrocities or war crimes, shall be arrested and brought to judgment.The Potsdam Agreement related to punishment of all Axis war criminals.Control Council Law No. 10 sets up the machinery to apply the PotsdamAgreement to European Axis war criminals and particularly to German warcriminals.The judgment further declares, however, that in the case of Germany,subjugation has occurred by virtue of military conquest. This holdingis based upon the previous declarations that at the time of theunconditional surrender of the German armed forces the Nazi governmenthad completely disintegrated, requiring the victorious belligerent totake over the complete exercise and control of governmental affairsof Germany, and thereby resulting in the transfer of her sovereigntyto the victorious Allied Powers. In this holding, the judgment simplyattempts to apply the provisions of rule 275 that subjugation orconquest implies a transfer of sovereignty. Obviously this ruleimplies that the question of subjugation is one of fact or intentionto be determined by the successful belligerent. There has been no actor declaration of the Allied Powers, either before or since theiroccupation of Germany under the terms of the unconditional surrender,which could possibly be construed as showing that they intend by thesubjugation and occupation of Germany to transfer her sovereignty tothemselves. To the contrary every declaration that has been made bythe Allied Powers with respect to their occupancy of Germany and theenactment of laws for her control during the occupation has emphasizedthe fact that the ultimate purpose of such occupancy is to destroythe Nazi form of government and militarism in Germany so that as thusextirpated from these influences she may take her place in the comityof the nations of the world.The declaration made in the judgment that Germany has been subjugatedby military conquest and that therefore her sovereignty has beentransferred to the successful belligerent Allied Powers cannot besustained either as a matter of fact or under any construction ofthe foregoing rules of land warfare. The control and operation ofGermany under the Allied Powers occupation is provisional. It doesnot transfer any sovereign power of Germany other than for the limitedpurpose of keeping the peace during occupancy, and for the ultimaterectification of the evils brought about by the Nazi regime andmilitarism, and in order to destroy such influences and to aid in theestablishment of a government in and for Germany under which she may inthe future earn her place in the comity of nations. In any event thisTribunal has no power or jurisdiction to determine such questions.The judgment further declares that Control Council Law No. 10 has adual aspect. The judgment states:   In its first aspect and on its face it purports to be a statute   defining crimes and providing for the punishment of persons who   violate its provisions. It is the legislative product of the   only body in existence having and exercising general lawmaking   power throughout the Reich.Obviously this aspect or theory of reasoning is predicated upon theprevious declarations that since at the time of the unconditionalsurrender the Nazi government had completely collapsed, and that,since the Allied Powers assumed the entire control of the governmentalfunction of Germany, her sovereignty was thereby transferred to theAllied Powers. It is then declared that Control Council Law No. 10was enacted by the Allied Control Council in and for Germany in theexercise of this transferred German sovereignty. Under this reasoningControl Council Law No. 10 merely became a local law in and forGermany because Germany, in the exercise of her national governmentalsovereignty, could not enact the law as international law. Nor can theAllied Control Council in the exercise of the transferred sovereigntyof Germany enact international law.The judgment further declares that the same and only supremelegislative authority in and for Germany, the Allied Control Council,gave this Tribunal jurisdiction and authority to enforce the localGerman law so enacted by it and to punish crimes in violation of it,including crimes by German nationals against German nationals asauthorized by Control Council Law No. 10. From the foregoing premisethe conclusion is inescapable that the Allied Control Council in theexercise of the sovereign power of Germany has enacted the law in andfor Germany and has authorized this Tribunal to punish criminals whoviolated the law in the manner of a German police court.The foregoing conclusion is based upon the articles by Freeman andFried, from which quotations are made in the judgment. This sametheory by Fried has been expressed in a subsequent statement whereinhe states, after reviewing the foregoing facts with respect to theunconditional surrender of the armed forces and the disintegration ofthe Nazi government, that--   This Tribunal (III) has the double quality of being an   international court and, owing to the special situation of   Germany at the present time, also a German court.This is the only possible conclusion that can be reached in thepremises stated.The second aspect of Control Council Law No. 10 is declared by thejudgment to be as follows:   We have discussed C. C. Law 10 in its first aspect as   substantive legislation. We now consider its other aspect.   Entirely aside from its character as substantive legislation, C.   C. Law 10, together with Ordinance No. 7, provides procedural   means previously lacking for the enforcement within Germany   of certain rules of international law which exist throughout   the civilized world independently of any new substantive   legislation.There can be no serious disagreement as regards this aspect or theoryof Control Council Law No. 10, but it is contrary to the first aspector theory of the law. The two aspects are diametrically opposed toeach other as to the source of authority for Control Council No.10. They are so conflicting with respect to the claims that the lawis both local law and international law that either one or the otheraspect cannot exist. The legislature of a national state cannot by alegislative act make international law binding upon other nations. Onlyan international legislative body may so legislate and no such body hasever existed.With regard to the premises supporting the view that Control CouncilLaw No. 10 has two aspects, the judgment apparently contains otherconflicting statements with respect to the source of authority forControl Council Law No. 10 and also with respect to the basis of theauthority of the legislative body to enact the law. The judgment statesat one place--   International law is not the product of statute. Its content   is not static. The absence from the world of any governmental   body authorized to enact substantive rules of international law   has not prevented the progressive development of that law. After   the manner of the English common law, it has grown to meet the   exigencies of changing conditions.The judgment recites at another point--   Since the Charter IMT and C. C. Law 10 are the product of   legislative action by an international authority, it follows   of necessity that there is no national constitution of any one   state which could be invoked to invalidate the substantive   provisions of such international legislation.At still another place the judgment recites--   In its aspect as a statute defining crime and providing   punishment the limited purpose of C. C. Law 10 is clearly set   forth. It is an exercise of supreme legislative power in and for   Germany. It does not purport to establish by legislative act any   new crimes of international applicability.Still at another place in the judgment it is declared that--   Only by giving consideration to the extraordinary and temporary   situation in Germany can the procedure here be harmonized with   established principles of national sovereignty. In Germany   an international body (the Control Council) has assumed and   exercised the power to establish judicial machinery for the   punishment of those who have violated the rules of the common   international law, a power which no international authority   without consent could assume or exercise within a state having a   national government presently in the exercise of its sovereign   powers.Thus, in the first quotation, the judgment states that there has neverbeen an international legislature and that, therefore, internationallaw is not the product of statute; whereas, in the second quotation,it is contended that Control Council Law No. 10 is the product oflegislative action by an international authority. The third recitationis that Control Council Law No. 10 is an exercise of supremelegislative power in and for Germany.The fourth quotation doubts the legality of our procedure unlessthe international body in Germany (the Allied Control Council) hasassumed and exercised the power to establish judicial machinery forpunishment of crimes in violation of international law. The source ofthe authority to set up courts and machinery for punishment of Germanwar criminals does not depend in any manner upon the exercise of anysovereign power of Germany. This matter will be later discussed.With these conflicting conclusions as to the source of authority ofControl Council Law No. 10, I must respectfully disagree. But thejudgment saves itself from them by finally waiving them aside andholding as follows:   For our purposes, however, it is unnecessary to determine   the present situs of residual sovereignty. It is sufficient   to hold that, by virtue of the situation at the time of   unconditional surrender, the Allied Powers were provisionally   in the exercise of supreme authority, valid and effective   until such time as, by treaty or otherwise, Germany shall be   permitted to exercise the full powers of sovereignty. We hold   that the legal right of the Four Powers to enact C. C. Law 10 is   established and that the jurisdiction of this Tribunal to try   persons charged as major war criminals of the European Axis must   be conceded.The judgment makes the further and additional declaration that--   The fact that the Four Powers are exercising supreme   legislative authority in governing Germany and for the   punishment of German criminals does not mean that the   jurisdiction of this Tribunal rests in the slightest degree   upon any German law, prerogative, or sovereignty. We sit as a   Tribunal drawing its sole power and jurisdiction from the will   and command of the victor states. The power and right exerted is   that of victors, not of the vanquished.With these declarations there is no disagreement. They waive andcompletely nullify the foregoing conflicting declarations of thejudgment with regard to the source of authority of Control Council LawNo. 10 and that its enactment was the exercise of German sovereigntyby the four Allied Powers.It is my view that the jurisdiction of this Tribunal is limited to thearea or field of international law which relates to the punishment ofwar criminals in the fullest sense of that term. The source of itsCharter and jurisdiction to try and punish European Axis war criminalsis as follows:              _Charter and Jurisdiction of this Tribunal_The charter and jurisdiction of this Military Tribunal are found withinthe framework of four instruments or documents: (1) Allied ControlCouncil Law No. 10; (2) Military Government Ordinance No. 7; (3) theCharter of the International Military Tribunal; and (4) the judgment ofthe International Military Tribunal. These instruments and documentsconfer power or jurisdiction upon this Tribunal to try and punishcertain European Axis war criminals. The source of Control Council LawNo. 10 and Ordinance 7 and the authority to enact or issue them arefound in certain unilateral agreements, instruments, and documents ofthe Allied Powers to which brief reference will be here made.By the Moscow Declaration of 30 October 1943 on German war atrocitiesand crimes, the three Allied Powers (the United Kingdom, the UnitedStates, and the Soviet Union) declared that at the time of grantingany armistice to Germany, those German officers and men and themembers of the Nazi Party who have been responsible for or have takena consenting part in committing such atrocities or crimes willbe adjudged and punished for their abominable deeds. By the YaltaConference of 11 February 1945 the same three Powers declared that onlythe unconditional surrender of the Axis powers will be accepted. Theplan for enforcing the unconditional surrender terms was agreed uponand provides that the Allied Powers will each occupy a separate zone ofGermany with coordinated administration and control through a CentralControl Council composed of the supreme commanders at Berlin. Francewas to be invited to take over a zone of occupation and to participateas a fourth member of the Control Council for Germany. Among otherthings, the Allied Powers declared that they intended to bring all warcriminals to just and swift punishment. They further declared thatthey intended to destroy German militarism and nazism and to insurethat Germany will never again be able to disturb the peace of theworld. With these provisional matters we are not concerned here.The German armed forces unconditionally surrendered on 8 May 1945.France accepted the invitation to become a fourth member of the AlliedControl Council and later took over a zone of occupation.By the Potsdam Agreement of 5 June 1945 and the declaration of theJoint Chiefs of Staff of 2 August 1945 at Berlin, the then FourAllied Powers expressly declared and provided that the punishment ofEuropean Axis war criminals was made a primary task of the militaryoccupation of Germany. They further declared that certain far reachingprovisional measures would be undertaken in Germany to rid her peopleof nazism and of militarism and to insure the peace and safety of theworld, and so that the German people thus extirpated will in the futuretake their place in the comity of nations. With these latter provisionswe are not here concerned. The Allied Control Council for Germany iscomposed of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the Four Allied Powers.By the London Agreement of 8 August 1945, the Four Allied Powersreferred to the Moscow Declaration and authorized, after consultationwith the Allied Control Council for Germany, the establishment of anInternational Military Tribunal to try certain of the European Axiswar criminals. The Charter of the Tribunal was attached to and madea part of the London Agreement. This Charter described the power andjurisdiction of the Tribunal and defined or recognized the crimes forwhich the European Axis war criminals were to be tried.The foregoing avowed policy of the Allied Powers for the punishmentof European war criminals or enemy persons was thereafter approvedand sanctioned by 19 of the United Nations in accordance with theprovisions of article V of the London Agreement.The International Military Tribunal was duly created and held its firstsession on 18 October 1945. The actual trial began on 20 November 1945of 22 alleged major war criminals; and by the judgment of 1 October1946 some of them were given death sentences; some of them were givenlife imprisonment; some were given lesser prison terms; and others ofthem were acquitted.After the foregoing trial began, the Allied Control Council forOccupied Germany met and on 20 December 1945 enacted Control CouncilLaw No. 10, which defined the jurisdiction of this and similar militarytribunals and recognized as crimes to be tried by them--1. Crimes against peace;2. War crimes;3. Crimes against humanity; and4. Membership in categories of a criminal group or organizationdeclared criminal by the International Military Tribunal.Control Council Law No. 10 recognizes as a crime, membership in anyorganization declared to be criminal by the International MilitaryTribunal.Article 9 of the London Charter provides that the IMT may declareany group or organization of which an individual was a member to bea criminal organization. Article 10 provides that the IMT may alsodeclare membership in an organization found by it to be criminal to bea crime. This the IMT did and further declared that its Charter makesthe declaration of criminality against an accused organization final.The IMT then fixed the character of membership which would be regardedas criminal, and expressly limited its declaration of group criminalityto persons who became or remained members of the organization withknowledge that it was being used for criminal acts or who werepersonally implicated as members of the organization in the commissionof such crimes. These findings and conclusions of the IMT are bindingupon this Tribunal.The Control Council declared that this law or procedure was intended toreach the German war criminals to be tried by the occupying powers ofGermany in their respective zones of occupation. The preamble statedthat the law was enacted by the authority of and to give effect tothe Moscow Declaration, the London Agreement, and the Charter of theInternational Military Tribunal. Thus, the avowed purpose of the AlliedPowers to punish German war criminals was given quadripartite agreementand application under Control Council Law No. 10.Military Government Ordinance No. 7 was issued on 26 October 1946pursuant to the powers of the Military Governor of the United StatesZone of Occupation within Germany, and further pursuant to the powerconferred upon the Zone Commander by Control Council Law No. 10,and articles 10 and 11 of the Charter of the International MilitaryTribunal annexed to the London Agreement of 8 August 1945, authorizingthe establishment of certain tribunals to be known as MilitaryTribunals. Accordingly, Military Tribunal III was established on 13February 1947, by virtue of the provisions of said Military GovernmentOrdinance No. 7, with powers to try and punish persons charged withoffenses recognized as crimes in article II of Control Council Law No.10, including conspiracies to commit such crimes. And article X ofOrdinance No. 7 provides that--   The determinations of the International Military Tribunal   in the judgments in Case No. 1 that invasions, aggressive   acts, aggressive wars, crimes, atrocities or inhumane acts   were planned or occurred, shall be binding on the tribunals   established hereunder and shall not be questioned except   insofar as the participation therein or knowledge thereof of   any particular person may be concerned. Statements of the   International Military Tribunal in the judgment in Case No. 1   shall constitute proof of the facts stated, in the absence of   substantial new evidence to the contrary.As so created and established this and other similar military tribunalsare international in character and jurisdiction. They are authorizedand empowered to try and punish the major war criminals of theEuropean Axis; to try and punish those German officers and men andmembers of the Nazi Party who have been responsible for, and have takena consenting part in, and have aided, abetted, ordered, or have beenconnected with plans or enterprises involving the commission of anyoffense recognized in Control Council Law No. 10 as a crime.The jurisdiction and power of this and similar tribunals to try andpunish war criminals find full support in established international lawrelating to warfare. This law is that during hostilities and beforetheir formal termination belligerents have concurrent jurisdiction overwar crimes committed by the captured enemy persons in their territoryor against their nationals in time of war. Accordingly, it has beengenerally recognized that belligerents during the war may legitimatelytry and punish enemy persons charged with infractions of the rules ofwar, if the accused is a prisoner of war and if the act charged hasbeen made a penal offense by the generally accepted laws and customsof war. In such cases the accused usually is tried before the court,commission, or tribunal set up by and adjudged in accordance with thelaws and procedure of the victor. After armistice or peace agreementthe matter of punishment of war crimes is determined by the termsthereof.The foregoing law was applied by the judgment of the InternationalMilitary Tribunal, which after referring to the Charter creating it,declared that--   The Charter is not an arbitrary exercise of power on the part   of the victorious nations, but in the view of the Tribunal,   as will be shown, it is the expression of international law   existing at the time of its creation; and to that extent is   itself a contribution to international law.   The Signatory Powers created this Tribunal, defined the law it   was to administer, and made regulations for the proper conduct   of the trial. In doing so, they have done together what any one   of them might have done singly; for it is not to be doubted   that any nation has the right thus to set up special courts to   administer law. With regard to the constitution of the court,   all that the defendants are entitled to ask is to receive a fair   trial on the facts and law.[677]Even prior to the foregoing IMT judgment, Lord Chief Justice Wrighthad so construed the London Charter in an article appearing in volume62 of the Law Quarterly Review, January 1946, page 41. He limits thediscussion to the punishment of war criminals. He there states that--   All I am here concerned with is a limited area of international   law, that relating to the trial and punishment of war criminals   in the full sense of that term, as adopted in the Agreement   of 8 August 1945, made in London between the Governments   of the United Kingdom, of the United States, of the French   Republic, and of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, which   established a Tribunal for the trial and punishment of the major   war criminals of the European Axis countries. The Agreement   includes as falling within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal   persons who committed the following crimes: (a) crimes against   peace, which means in effect planning, preparation, initiation,   or waging of a war of aggression; (b) war crimes, by which term   is meant mainly violation of the laws and customs of war; (c)   crimes against humanity, in particular murder, extermination,   enslavement, deportation and other inhumane acts committed   against any civilian population.   The Tribunal so established is described in the Agreement   as an International Military Tribunal. Such an International   Tribunal is intended to act under international law. It is   clearly to be a judicial tribunal constituted to apply and   enforce the appropriate rules of international law. I understand   the Agreement to import that the three classes of persons which   it specifies are war criminals, that the acts mentioned in   classes (a), (b), and (c) are crimes for which there is properly   individual responsibility; that they are not crimes because of   the agreement of the four governments, but that the governments   have scheduled them as coming under the jurisdiction of the   Tribunal because they are already crimes by existing law. On   any other assumption the court would not be a court of law but   a manifestation of power. The principles which are declared in   the Agreement are not laid down as an arbitrary direction to   the court but are intended to define and do, in my opinion,   accurately define what is the existing international law on   these matters.Similar holdings may be made with respect to Control Council Law No. 10which recognizes the same basic crimes to be tried by this Tribunal aswere recognized by the London Charter. Each such law is an expressionof the treaties, rules, and customs of international law on crimesagainst peace, war crimes, and crimes against humanity; each is ineffect and purpose a listing of crimes in violation of preexistinginternational law and each to that extent is itself a contribution tointernational law. (IMT judgment, _supra_.) But IMT did not restits declaration of authority and its procedure upon the Charter whichcreated it, but on the contrary, discussed at length the matters beforeit from the standpoint of preexisting international law. No defendantwas convicted by the International Military Tribunal except for crimesin violation of preexisting international law which they held toexist even as to crimes against peace. It supported its judgment thateach crime was based upon preexisting international law or custom ofwar, discussing at length the matter of violation of internationaltreaties and agreements, particularly the Hague Conventions of 1899 and1907, the Peace Conference of 1919, the violation of the VersaillesTreaty, the various treaties of mutual guarantee, arbitration, andnonaggression, and the Kellogg-Briand Pact.[678]Under American law (National Defense Act of 4 June 1920) a militarycourt or commission may be set up to try persons in the custody of theUnited States Government or its armed forces for crimes in violationof international law. The right to punish such war criminals is notdependent upon any question of unconditional surrender or of whetherhostilities have ceased. As regards these matters, in the recentcase of Yamashita, the United States Supreme Court makes severalpronouncements applicable here, as follows:   The trial and punishment of enemy combatants who have committed   violations of the law of war is thus not only a part of the   conduct of war operating as a preventive measure against such   violation, but is an exercise of the authority sanctioned by   Congress to administer the system of military justice recognized   by law of war, that sanction is without qualification as to the   exercise of this authority so long as a state of war exists,   from its declaration until peace is proclaimed. Articles of War,   articles 2, 15.          *       *       *       *       *       *       *   The mere fact that hostilities have ceased does not preclude   the trial of offenders against the law of war before a military   commission, at least until peace has been officially recognized   by treaty or proclamation of the political branch of the   government. Articles of War, article 15.   The extent to which power to prosecute violations of the laws   of war shall be exercised before peace is declared rests, not   with courts, but with the political branch of the government,   and may itself be governed by terms of an armistice or a treaty   of peace.[679]The importance of the Yamashita decision is apparent. The InternationalMilitary Tribunal was established by the London Agreement, 8 August1945, with its Charter annexed thereto. On entirely similar principlesthe Charter of the International Military Tribunal, or other tribunalsor commissions, for the trial of major war criminals in the Far Eastwas proclaimed on 19 January 1946. These tribunals or commissionsof similar principles were all established in accordance with theBerlin Agreement of 2 August 1945, which defined the meaning of theunconditional surrender of the armed forces of the Axis Powers,and declared that the Allied Powers intended to punish capturedwar criminals of the European Axis Powers. All such commissions ortribunals are deemed to exercise military powers and therefore aredescribed as Military Tribunals. This includes the tribunals createdunder the provisions of Control Council Law No. 10 and Ordinance 7.The judges of these Tribunals set up under Law No. 10 and Ordinance 7are appointed by the War Department, by the acts of the Secretary ofWar, by the President of the United States as Commander-in-Chief of theArmed Forces, and by the Commanding General of the American Zone ofOccupation in Germany. These judges take an oath to faithfully performthe task thus assigned to them to the best of their ability.The Supreme Court of the United States had previously applied the ruleannounced in the Yamashita case in the case of Quirin and six others(_317 U. S. 1_). The court declared that:   The law of war includes that part of the law of nations which   prescribes for the conduct of war the status, rights, and duties   of enemy nations as well as of enemy individuals.   Under the law of war lawful combatants are subject to   capture and detention as prisoners of war by opposing military   forces and unlawful combatants are likewise subject to capture   and detention but in addition they are subject to trial and   punishment by military tribunals for acts which render their   belligerency unlawful.This authority is expressly conferred by article 15 of the Articles ofWar enacted by Congress on 4 June 1920.It may be here again observed that international law is an unwrittenlaw. There has never been an international legislative authority.The law of nations is founded upon various international rules andcustoms, which gradually obtain universal recognition and thus becomeinternational law. Likewise the law of war is built upon treatiesand upon the usages, customs, and practices of warfare by civilizednations, which gradually obtain universal recognition, and also becomeestablished by the general principles of justice as applied by juristsand military courts, tribunals, or commissions. And as held by the IMT:   The Signatory Powers created this Tribunal, defined the law it   was to administer, and made regulations for the proper conduct   of the trial. In doing so, they have done together what any one   of them might have done singly; for it is not to be doubted   that any nation has the right thus to set up special courts to   administer law. With regard to the constitution of the court,   all that the defendants are entitled to ask is to receive a fair   trial on the facts and law.[680]After the unconditional surrender, the Allied Powers have obtained theactual custody of many of the leaders of the German Government, andthe German armies, and many of those who were active participants innameless atrocities against prisoners of war, other persons allegedin the indictment, and civilians of invaded countries, and the powerto try such Axis war criminals must be conceded. This power to trythese crimes could have been exercised as an entirely military one,but such a method would not accord with Anglo-Saxon or United Statesideology. It has been planned to conduct orderly trials, and fairtrials, in accordance with the American concepts of due process, givingthe accused the benefit of indictment, notice, counsel of their ownchoosing, witnesses in their behalf, proof beyond a reasonable doubt,and judgment by experienced jurists who are under the obligations of asolemn oath to render even and exact justice. Surely this is giving tothe accused rights which they denied to their helpless victims.It may be here observed that each of the defendants in this case hasbeen captured or arrested and is now in the custody and jurisdiction ofthis Tribunal. Each of them has been charged by the indictment in thiscase with having committed two or more of the offenses recognized ascrimes by the foregoing instruments which define and limit the Charterand jurisdiction of this Tribunal and which authorize this Tribunal totry and punish any individual found guilty of having committed suchcrimes or offenses. There has been no formal declaration of peace andofficially a state of war still exists between the Allied Powers andGermany.Under the doctrine of the Quirin and Yamashita cases, the AlliedPowers, or either of them, have the right to try and punish individualdefendants in this case. These cases hold that where individualoffenders are charged with offenses against the laws of nations, andparticularly the laws of war, they may be tried by military tribunalsor courts set up by the offended government or belligerent power. Insuch cases no question as to the character of military occupation noras to the character of belligerency is involved, or whether or nothostilities have ceased. These cases recognize the right to try andpunish individuals who are in the custody and jurisdiction of suchmilitary court or commission so long as peace has not been officiallydeclared by the authorities competent to conclude such matters.After armistice or peace agreement, the matter of punishing warcriminals is a question for the parties making the peace agreement todetermine. In consequence, the question of whether hostilities haveceased is not material. And as is so ably said in the Yamashita case(_66 S. Ct. 340_)--   The extent to which power to prosecute violations of the laws   of war shall be exercised before peace is declared rests, not   with courts, but with the political branch of the Government   and may itself be governed by terms of an armistice or a treaty   of peace.                             _Conspiracy_Count one of the indictment charged the defendants with having,pursuant to a common design, conspired and agreed together and witheach other and with divers other persons to commit war crimes andcrimes against humanity, as defined in article II of Control CouncilLaw No. 10, in that each of the defendants participated eitheras a principal, or an accessory, or ordered and abetted, or tooka consenting part in, or was connected with plans or enterprisesinvolving the commission of the war crimes and crimes againsthumanity as set forth in the indictment; and that each defendant soparticipating was therefore responsible for his own acts and for theacts of all other defendants in the commission of the crimes.This Tribunal has ruled that under no provision of Law No. 10 wasconspiracy made a separate substantive and punishable crime. But thedefendants may be punished for having committed war crimes or crimesagainst humanity by acts constituting a conspiracy to commit them.Under the foregoing allegations of count one, the defendants arecharged with having committed war crimes and crimes against humanity byacts constituting a conspiracy to commit them. This Tribunal has notapplied or convicted any defendant under the conspiracy charge of theindictment. All defendants convicted, save one, have been convictedunder a plan or scheme to commit the alleged war crimes or crimesagainst humanity. The same facts are alleged and proved as constitutinga conspiracy to commit the same war crimes and crimes against humanity.The same facts under which certain defendants were convicted of havingcommitted war crimes and crimes against humanity by carrying out theNight and Fog decree were alleged and, by the same evidence, proved tobe a common design or conspiracy to commit such crimes. The same istrue of the plan or scheme to persecute and exterminate Poles and Jewsupon racial grounds.There is no material difference between a plan or scheme to commit aparticular crime and a common design or conspiracy to commit the samecrime. In legal concept there can be no material difference to plan,scheme, or conspire to commit a crime. But of them all, the conspiracyto commit the crimes charged in the indictment is the most realisticbecause the Nazi crimes are in reality indivisible and each plan,scheme, or conspiracy proved in the instant case was in reality aninterlocking part of the whole criminal undertaking or enterprise.That Control Council Law No. 10 and Ordinance 7 authorize a convictionfor committing war crimes and crimes against humanity by conspiracy tocommit certain acts, which are defined or recognized as war crimes orcrimes against humanity by international law and by Control Council LawNo. 10, is clear.In paragraph I (_a_) of article II of Control Council Law No. 10, as inarticle 6 (_a_) of the London Charter, it is provided that a conspiracyto initiate or wage an aggressive war is a crime against peace. Thedefendants are not charged with having committed or conspired tocommit a crime against the peace but were so charged in the firstinternational trial.In discussing the issue of conspiracy the International MilitaryTribunal limited the scope of its inquiry to consideration ofconspiracy to initiate or wage an aggressive war. It did not determinewhether a conspiracy could be recognized as a crime under internationallaw relating to war, or whether a conspiracy to commit such a crimehad in fact been proved. It merely held that the concept of conspiracyunder its Charter was more restricted than that set forth in theindictment which the prosecution sought to prove. That Tribunal did notconstrue article II of Control Council Law No. 10 to determine whetherit authorized the punishment of a separate crime of conspiracy. Neitherdid it determine whether the offenses of war crimes or crimes againsthumanity could be committed by the acts which in fact constitute aconspiracy to commit such crimes.The Charter of the International Tribunal provided in article 6 (_c_)that:          *       *       *       *       *       *       *   Leaders, organizers, instigators and accomplices participating   in the formulation or execution of a common plan or conspiracy   to commit any of the foregoing crimes are responsible for all   acts performed by any persons in execution of such plan.This provision of the International Charter is not found in ControlCouncil Law No. 10. In lieu thereof the following pertinent andsignificant language was used [Article II]:   2. Any person without regard to nationality or the capacity   in which he acted, is deemed to have committed a crime as   defined in paragraph 1 of this article, if he was (_a_)   a principal or (_b_) was an accessory to the commission   of any such crime or ordered or abetted the same or (_c_)   took a consenting part therein or (_d_) was connected with   plans or enterprises involving its commission or (_e_)   was a member of any organization or group connected with the   commission of any such crime or (_f_) with reference to   paragraph 1 (_a_), if he held a high political, civil or   military (including General Staff) position in Germany or in   one of its Allies, co-belligerents or satellites, or held high   position in the financial, industrial or economic life of any   such country.This language in detail defines the acts which constitute aiding andabetting and is so specific and so comprehensive that it has definedconspiracy without employing the word. The language omits no element ofthe crime of conspiracy. As a rule there can be no such thing as aidingand abetting without some previous agreement or understanding or commondesign in the execution of which the aider and abetter promoting thatcommon design has made himself guilty as a principal.The foregoing provisions of paragraph 2 were intended to serve someuseful purpose. War crimes and crimes against humanity had been definedor recognized and illustrated in paragraph 1 of Law No. 10 and didnot need further explanation. Obviously, the provisions of paragraph2 were intended to provide that if the act of one person did notcomplete the crime charged, but the acts of two or more persons did,then each person connected with the plans or enterprises involving itscommission is guilty of the crime. This is the gravamen of the lawof conspiracy. Conspiracy is universally known as a plan, scheme, orcombination of two or more persons to commit a certain unlawful act orcrime.The conspiracies charged in the indictment and defined by Law No.10 are conspiracies or plans to commit war crimes or crimes againsthumanity, which are established crimes under international laws orcustoms of war. In the very nature of such crimes their commission isusually by more than one person. Therefore the purpose of showing theconspiracy to commit such crimes was to establish the participation ofeach defendant and the degree of his connection with such crimes.Since the language of paragraph 2 of Law No. 10 expressly providesthat any person connected with plans involving the commission of awar crime or crime against humanity is deemed to have committed suchcrimes, it is equivalent to providing that the crime is committedby acts constituting a conspiracy under the ordinary meaning of theterm. Manifestly it was not necessary to place the label conspiracyupon acts which themselves define and constitute in fact and in law aconspiracy. Paragraph 2 was so interpreted by the Zone Commander whenhe issued Military Government Ordinance No. 7, which authorized thecreation of this and similar military tribunals, and which provides inarticle I that--   The purpose of this Ordinance is to provide for the   establishment of military tribunals which shall have power to   try and punish persons charged with offenses recognized as   crimes in article II of Control Council Law No. 10, including   conspiracies to commit any such crimes. * * *.The prosecution also placed the same interpretation upon paragraph 2,because paragraph 2 of count one of the indictment charges that thedefendants herein * * * were principals in, accessories to, ordered,abetted, took a consenting part in, and were connected with plans andenterprises involving the commission of war crimes and crimes againsthumanity. Evidently the drawer of the indictment had before himparagraph 2 of Control Council Law No. 10 and made its language thebasis of the charging of a conspiracy to commit war crimes or crimesagainst humanity.Furthermore, it is apparent that the declared purpose of Ordinance No.7, as set forth in article I thereof, is part and parcel of the entireordinance as much as any other article thereof and the other articlesof the ordinance, as well as Law No. 10, must be construed and appliedin the light of article I. In fact article I is distinctly that portionof Ordinance No. 7 which defines the jurisdiction of the militarytribunals authorized by it.The Tribunal should therefore declare that military tribunals ascreated by Ordinance No. 7 have jurisdiction over conspiracy tocommit any and all crimes defined in article II of Law No. 10. Afterall, from a practical standpoint, it can make little difference to anydefendant whether the Tribunal finds that such defendant is a member ofa conspiracy to commit crimes on the one hand, this being the languageof article I of Ordinance No. 7, or on the other hand whether theTribunal should find he was (a) a principal or (b) an accessory or thathe abetted the same or (c) took a consenting part therein or (d) wasconnected with plans or enterprises involving commission of crimes,these latter descriptions being the language of paragraph 2 of articleII of Law No. 10.In most modern English and American jurisprudence, conspiracy pure andsimple is not recognized as a separate crime. The only legal importanceof finding that any accused person is a party to a conspiracy is tohold the conspirator responsible as an aider and abetter of criminalacts committed by other parties to the conspiracy. If the partyknowingly aided and abetted in the execution of the plan and becameconnected with plans or enterprises involving the commission of warcrimes and crimes against humanity, he thereby became a co-conspiratorwith those who conceived the plan. It makes no difference whether theplan or enterprise was that of only one of the conspirators. Upon thispoint we quote from the judgment of the International Tribunal--   The argument that such common planning cannot exist where there   is complete dictatorship is unsound. A plan in the execution   of which a number of persons participate is still a plan, even   though conceived by only one of them; and those who execute the   plan do not avoid responsibility by showing that they acted   under the direction of the man who conceived it.[681]This holding answers the further contention that one connectedwith execution of such a plan of Hitler could not be guilty ofconspiracy, or punishable for helping carry out the plan or scheme as aco-conspirator. It is undoubtedly true that not all of the defendantshad any part in the formulation of the plan, scheme, or conspiracy ofthe Nazi regimes Ministry of Justice to carry out the NN decree, butthey did know of its illegality and inhumane purpose and helped tocarry it out. The facts show beyond a reasonable doubt that they didknowingly aid, abet, and become connected with the plan, scheme, orconspiracy in aid of waging the war and committed those war crimes [andcrimes] against humanity as charged in the indictment. A more perfectplan or scheme to show a conspiracy to commit crimes could hardly bewritten than was the agreement entered into by the OKW, Ministry ofJustice, and the Gestapo to execute and carry out the Hitler Night andFog decree. All the defendants who took a part in the execution andcarrying out of the NN Decree knew of its illegality and of its crueland inhumane purposes.

The names not preceded by any designation represent   defendants. ---+-----------------------------+-------------------------+-------------    |                             |                         |   Pages    |          Name               |    Date of Testimony    |(mimeographed    |                             |                         | transcript) ---+-----------------------------+-------------------------+------------- D  |ALTMEYER, Hans Josef         |15, 16 Jul 47            |52445308    |ALTSTOETTER, Josef           |15, 16 Sep 47            |88418962    |AMMON, Dr. Wilhelm von       |1, 4 Aug 47              |63776473 P  |ANCKER, Edinger              |29 Apr 47                |27432761 D  |AZESDORFER, Dr. Hermann      |9 Sep 47                 |84378469 PA |BAEUMLER, Dr. Josef          |3 Jun 47                 |38183833    |BARNICKEL, Paul              |26, 27, 28 Aug 47        |76497752;    |                             |                         |  77807901 PA |BAUR, Armin                  |23 May 47                |35983606 D  |BECHER, Dr. Werner H.        |17, 25 Sep 47            |89698998;    |                             |                         |  95149517 P  |BEHL, Dr. Ferdinand C.

Numerous decrees and laws from Document NG-715are reproduced in this and later sections of this volume. Therefore,where a particular law or decree is reproduced in different partsof this volume under the heading Partial Translation of DocumentNG-715, this does not necessarily mean that only extracts from thatlaw or decree are reproduced. It merely means that only a part ofDocument NG-715, which in fact contained many different documents, isreproduced at that point.[83] The defense often included all or parts of documents in theirdocument books which had previously been introduced as exhibits by theprosecution. This was not necessary, of course, in order to give thedefense the benefit of materials contained in prosecution exhibits,but it was apparently done to bring together in one place (the defensedocument books) the documentary materials upon which the defendantprincipally relied. In this volume the editors have occasionally notedthe designation of documents as both prosecution and defense exhibits.[84] During the early period of the Nazi regime, this decree served asthe basis for numerous restrictions on personal freedom, includingthe placing of persons in protective custody without trial. Forexample, see the Goering decree concerning the Secret State Police(Gestapo) of 11 March 1934, (Klemm Doc. 28, Klemm Ex. 28), reproducedbelow in section V B. See also Document NG-478, Prosecution Exhibit 61,in section C-3.[85] These articles, contained in part II (Fundamental Rights andDuties of Germans) of the Weimar constitution, read:   Article 114. Personal liberty is inviolable. No encroachment on   or deprivation of personal liberty by any public authority is   permissible except in virtue of a law.   Persons, who have been deprived of their liberty, shall be   informed--at the latest on the following day--by what authority   and on what grounds the deprivation of liberty has been ordered;   opportunity shall be given them without delay to make legal   complaint against such deprivation.   Article 115. The residence of every German is an inviolable   sanctuary for him; exceptions are admissible only in virtue of   laws.          *       *       *       *       *   Article 117. The secrecy of correspondence and of the postal,   telegraph, and telephone services is inviolable. Exceptions may   be permitted only by law of the Reich.   Article 118. Every German has the right, within the limits of   general laws, to express his opinion freely, by word of mouth,   writing, printed matter or picture, or any other manner. This   right must not be affected by any conditions of his work or   appointment, and no one is permitted to injure him on account of   his making use of such rights.   No censorship shall be enforced, but restrictive regulations   may be introduced by law in reference to cinematograph   entertainments. Legal measures are also admissible for the   purpose of combating bad and obscene literature, as well as for   the protection of youth in public exhibitions and performances.          *       *       *       *       *   Article 123. All Germans have the right without notification or   special permission to assemble peaceably and unarmed.   Open-air meetings may be made notifiable by a law of the Reich,   and in case of direct danger to public security may be forbidden.   Article 124. All Germans have the right to form unions   and associations for purposes not in contravention of the   penal laws. This right may not be restricted by preventive   regulations. The same provisions apply to religious unions and   associations.   Every union is at liberty to acquire legal rights in accordance   with the provisions of the Civil Code. These rights shall not   be refused to a union on the ground that its objects are of   political, social-political, or religious nature.          *       *       *       *       *   Article 153. Property is guaranteed by the constitution. Its   extent and the restrictions placed upon it are defined by law.   Expropriation may be effected only for the benefit of the   general community and upon the basis of law. It shall be   accompanied by due compensation, save insofar as may be   otherwise provided by a law of the Reich. In case of dispute   as to the amount of compensation, resort may be had to legal   proceedings in the ordinary course, unless a law of the Reich   otherwise determines. Property of the states, local authorities,   and public utility associations may be expropriated by the Reich   only on payment of compensation.   The ownership of property entails obligations. Its use must at   the same time serve the common good.[86] This act became known as the Enabling Act because it authorizedHitler and his government to alter the statutory law and even theconstitution of Germany without the participation or consent of thelegislative bodies. See the testimony of the expert witness for thedefense, Professor Jahrreiss, section D, below.[87] This law repealed an earlier law of 28 April 1933 creating aspecial basis for imposing disciplinary penalties on members of the SAand the SS.[88] Before the reorganization of the German judicial system by theHitler regime, the administration of justice was largely the functionof the separate German states (Laender) making up the Reich.[89] For more extensive evidence from the record concerning treason andrelated matters, see section V E, below.[90] This part is reproduced below on page 231.[91] The full text of this law was submitted in evidence asSchlegelberger Document 26, Schlegelberger Defense Exhibit 66. Theparts of the law not reproduced here deal with arrangements for thefurther transfer of the administration of justice from the individualGerman states (Laender) to the Reich.[92] Article 2 of the penal code prior to the above amendment was asfollows:For no act may punishment be imposed unless such punishment isprescribed by statute before the act is committed. In the event of anychange in the statute between the time of commission of an act and thetime of rendering a decision, the most lenient statute shall apply.[93] This law and the Reich citizenship law of the same date constitutethe original Nuernberg Laws, so-called because both were issuedin Nuernberg at the Reich Party Congress for Freedom. The Reichcitizenship law (1935 Reichsgesetzblatt, Part I, page 1146), was signedby Hitler and Frick, the Reich Minister of Interior. The text of thislaw reads as follows:   The Reichstag has unanimously decided on the following law,   which is herewith promulgated:   1. (1) A citizen [Staatsangehoeriger] is one who belongs to the   protective association of the German Reich and owes allegiance   to it. (2) Citizenship can also be obtained according to   regulations of the Reich and State citizenship law.   2. (1) A Reich citizen [Reichsbuerger] is only a citizen of   German or related blood, who proves through his behaviour, that   he is willing and fit to serve the German people and Reich   faithfully. (2) Reich citizenship [Reichsbuergerrecht] will be   obtained through the award of a Reich citizenship letter. (3)   The Reich citizen is the sole bearer of full political rights to   the extent of the law.   3. The Reich Minister of the Interior decrees in collaboration   with the deputy of the Fuehrer those legal and administrative   regulations necessary for the execution and supplementation of   this law.      [94] A number of further decrees as well as other materials   concerning the application of the Nuernberg Laws in the   Incorporated Eastern Territories (Poland), are reproduced below   in section V D 2.      [95] This extract is taken from Prof. Arthur Brands book,   _The German Civil Service Law_, Berlin, 1937, p. 123.   The book contains the law with extensive annotations and   commentaries, as well as further regulations on the law.      [96] Note that the decree is dated 17 August 1938, at which time   it was signed by Hitler and Keitel. It was not promulgated in   the Reichsgesetzblatt, however, until 26 August 1939. The decree   had no general preamble. The earlier articles are entitled:   1. Substantive law; 2. Espionage; 3. Guerrilla warfare;   and 4. Acts contrary to decrees issued by the commanders in   occupied foreign territory.      [97] Materials concerning the application of the law of   undermining of military efficiency are reproduced below in   section V-E.      [98] This decree was not published in the Reichsgesetzblatt.   It was taken from a letter of 9 September 1939 from Meissner,   chief of the Presidential Chancellery, transmitting this decree   to the chief of the Reich Chancellery and to the chief of the   Chancellery of the Fuehrer of the Nazi Party.      [99] Material concerning the application of laws on public   enemies is reproduced below in section V E.      [100] For other decrees concerning the establishment and   jurisdiction of Special Courts, see section C 3 below.      [101] Article 1 of this decree was also introduced as a part   of Document NG-715, Prosecution Exhibit 112. This decree and a   decree of 15 July 1942 extending the jurisdiction of SS courts   into Bohemia and Moravia (reproduced later in this section as   another part of Document NG-715, Prosecution Exhibit 112) were   the subject of questions put to the defendant Schlegelberger by   Judge Harding. This testimony is reproduced below in section V D   3.      [102] The SS Death Head units were in charge of the   concentration camps.      [103] Material concerning the application of the laws on public   enemies are reproduced below in section V E.      [104] The Reich Citizenship Law and the Law for the Protection   of German Blood and Honor, both announced in Nuernberg on 15   September 1939, were the basic parts of the so-called Nuernberg   Laws. See the Law for the Protection of German Blood and Honor,   reproduced earlier in this section also as a part of Document   NG-715, Prosecution Exhibit 112. Further decrees and other   materials concerning Jews are reproduced below in section V D 2.      [105] The reference is to Hitlers speech to the Reichstag on   the same day, 26 April 1942. Extracts from this speech (Doc.   NG-752, Pros. Ex. 24) are reproduced below in section V C 2a.      [106] The decree of 17 October 1939 establishing special   jurisdiction in criminal proceedings against members of the SS   and members of police formations on special tasks, (Klemm Doc.   29, Klemm Ex. 29), is reproduced earlier in this section.      [107] Thierack at this time had just been appointed Reich   Minister of Justice. From late January 1941 until the middle of   August 1942, the defendant Schlegelberger had been acting Reich   Minister of Justice. Evidence concerning developments in the   administration of justice while Thierack was Reich Minister are   reproduced below in section V C3.

[114] Defendant Mettgenberg later testified that in department   III of the Ministry of Justice he held the position of Referent   for legislation in the field of international penal law and   that in department IV he was a subdepartment chief in charge   of a sphere of work which, above all, also concerned affairs of   international penal law (Tr. p. 6251).      [115] For various periods of time under the Hitler regime, over   half of the defendants held one or more of the various titles   and positions which the defendant Mettgenberg here proceeds to   describe. For example, the defendant Joel was a Referent and   later a ministerial counsellor; the defendants von Ammon and   Westphal were ministerial counsellors; the defendant Mettgenberg   himself was a Ministerialdirigent; the defendants Altstoetter   and Engert were ministerial directors; and the defendants   Schlegelberger, Klemm and Rothenberger were Under Secretaries.   Only two persons held the position of Reich Minister of Justice   during the Hitler regime, Guertner and Thierack, both of whom   were dead by the time of the trial. The defendant Schlegelberger   was acting Reich Minister of Justice between the death of   Guertner in January 1941 and Thieracks appointment as Minister   in August 1942.      [116] This summary and the following two charts are part of   the Basic Information submitted by the prosecution at the   beginning of the case as an aid to the understanding of the   evidence to be later submitted.      [117] This decree is reproduced on p. 218.      [118] This decree is reproduced on p. 231.      [119] For further information on this subject, see   contemporaneous documents below in section C5.      [120] The decree on court martial procedure is reproduced below   in section C6.      [121] A much enlarged copy of this chart was displayed in the   courtroom during several sessions of the trial as a visual aid   in argument and in the presentation of evidence.      [122] A number of the contemporaneous documents reproduced   later in this volume deal with trials held before Special   Courts. Among the specific cases treated herein are the   Katzenberger case (Doc. NG-270, Pros. Ex. 155, and Doc. NG-154,   Pros.

[130] This decree, dated 20 December 1934, is reproduced on p.   173 under the title, _Law on Insidious Acts against State and   for the Protection of Party Uniforms_.      [131] A number of the contemporaneous documents reproduced   later in this volume deal with trials held before senates of   the Peoples Court. Among the specific cases treated herein are   the Stenfanowicz-Lenczewski case (Doc. NG-351, Pros. Ex. 132),   reproduced below in section V D 2; the Bratek case (Doc. NG-595,   Pros. Ex. 136), reproduced in part below in section V E; the   Beck case (Doc. NG-381, Pros. Ex. 159), reproduced in part below   in section V E; and the Paschen case (Doc. NG-546, Pros. Ex.   141), reproduced below in section V E.      [132] The law of 24 April 1934 consists of three chapters   or parts (each divided into several articles and sections).   Chapter I broadened and redefined the concepts of high treason   and treason, according to National Socialist principles by   amended articles 8093 of the Reich criminal code. Chapter I   is reproduced in part above in section B, Selected Laws and   Decrees. Chapter III of the law, reproduced here, established   a special judicial machinery to deal with high treason and   treason as newly defined in chapters I and II. Materials on the   application and interpretation of these provisions on treason   and high treason are reproduced below in section V E.      [133] This decree is reproduced on p. 160.      [134] From 1936 until 1942, Thierack was President of the   Peoples Court. In 1942, Thierack became Reich Minister of   Justice, and Freisler, President of the Peoples Court.      [135] This law is reproduced in part on p. 182.      [136] Decree of the Reich President for the protection of people   and State is reproduced on p. 160.      [137] The hereditary health courts dealt with sterilization   of human beings. Because of space limitations, a relatively   small amount of the evidence introduced in the Justice Case   has been reproduced in this volume. However, sterilization was   also the subject of charges in the Medical Case. See Medical   Experiments--Experiments for Mass Sterilization (sec. VII A 15,   Vol. I, pp. 694 ff., this series).      [138] Reference is made to the basic law of 14 July 1933,   reproduced in part immediately above.      [139] Dr. Conti was Reich Health Leader   (Reichsgesundheitsfuehrer). His activities came into issue in   the Medical Case, United States _vs._ Karl Brandt, et al.,   Volumes I and II, this series. Conti committed suicide in 1945   after Germanys unconditional surrender.      [140] Complete testimony is recorded in the mimeographed   transcript, 25 and 26 June 1947, pages 42534364.      [141] Reference is made to the Law Concerning the Head of the   German Reich, 1 August 1934 (1934 Reichsgesetzblatt, pt. I,   p. 747). This law reads as follows: Article 1. The office   of the Reich President is herewith united with that of the   Reich Chancellor. Therefore, the prerogatives hitherto held by   the Reich President are transferred to the Fuehrer and Reich   Chancellor, Adolf Hitler. He determines his deputy. Article 2.   This law becomes effective from the time of the death of Reich   President Hindenberg. Hindenberg died on 2 August 1934. This   law was signed by Hitler and 14 Reich ministers.      [142] This act is reproduced on page 163.      [143] Article 53 reads--The President of the Reich appoints   and dismisses the Chancellor of the Reich and, on the latters   recommendation, the ministers of the Reich.      [144] Article 54 reads--The Chancellor of the Reich and the   ministers of the Reich require the confidence of the Reichstag   in the administration of their office. Any one of them must   resign should the confidence of the Reichstag be withdrawn by an   express resolution.      [145] Article 50 reads--All orders and decrees of the   President of the Reich, including those relating to the armed   forces, require for their validity the countersignature of   the Chancellor or the competent minister of the Reich. The   countersignature entails the undertaking of responsibility.      [146] Article 76 reads--The constitution may be amended   by legislation. But decisions of the Reichstag as to such   amendments come into effect only if two-thirds of the legal   total of members be present, and if at least two-thirds of those   present have given their consent. Decisions of the Reichsrat in   favor of amendments of the constitution also require a majority   of two-third of the votes cast. Where an amendment of the   constitution is decided by an appeal to the people as the result   of a popular initiative, the consent of the majority of the   voters is necessary.   Should the Reichstag have decided upon an alteration of the   constitution in spite of the objection of the Reichsrat, the   president of the Reich shall not promulgate the law if the   Reichsrat, within 2 weeks, demands an appeal to the people.      [147] Article 102 reads--Judges are independent and subject   only to the law.      [148] The problem referred to by the witness was briefly the   following: The value of the German currency having fallen to   a very small fraction of its prewar value, debtors were able   to pay off debts by paying, in terms of purchasing power, only   a small fraction of the original debt. This brought hardship   to many creditors. Hence, the question was whether, under the   doctrine of unjust enrichment, or under some similar doctrine,   or by virtue of special legislation, these debts, particularly   toward creditors in the lower economic strata, should be   revalued.      [149] Article 48, paragraph 2, reads--Where public security and   order are seriously disturbed or endangered within the Reich,   the President of the Reich may take the measures necessary for   their restoration, intervening in case of need with the help of   armed forces. For this purpose he is permitted, for the time   being, to abrogate either wholly or partially the fundamental   rights laid down in articles 114, 115, 117, 118, 123, 124, and   153.   The articles subject to temporary suspension are quoted in the   footnote to the decree of 28 February 1933, the first decree   reproduced in section B, above.      [150] Article 43 reads--The president of the Reich holds office   for 7 years. Reelection is permissible.   The president of the Reich may, upon the motion of the   Reichstag, be removed from office before the expiration of his   term by the vote of the people. The resolution of the Reichstag   requires to be carried by a two-thirds majority. Upon the   adoption of such a resolution, the president of the Reich is   prevented from the further exercise of his office. Refusal to   remove him from office, expressed by the vote of the people, is   equivalent to reelection, and entails the dissolution of the   Reichstag.   Penal proceedings may not be taken against the president of the   Reich without the consent of the Reichstag.      [151] The red folder contained the order of the Reich   President dissolving the Parliament (Reichstag). In some   instances, the Reich Chancellor would bring the red folder   with him into a session of the Reichstag, thus indicating that   the Reich President had already signed but not yet promulgated   the order dissolving the Reichstag and making it clear to the   Reichstag that an adverse vote would lead to the dissolution of   the Reichstag.      [152] Paragraph 3 of article 48 reads: The President of the   Reich must, without delay, inform the Reichstag of any measures   taken in accordance with paragraph 1 or 2 of this article. Such   measures shall be abrogated up on the demand of the Reichstag.      [153] In a previous section of his testimony, the witness had   differentiated between the ordinary private citizen, who was   affected by many norms only indirectly, and such categories as   the soldiers and the public employees, who were more directly   affected by certain norms.      [154] Article 4 reads: The generally recognized rules of   international law are valid as binding constituent parts of the   law of the German Reich.      [155] Article 4 is quoted in footnote immediately preceding.   Article 45, paragraph 3, reads: Alliances and treaties with   foreign states which refer to matters in which the Reich has   legislative power require the consent of the Reichstag.      [156] Other extracts from the testimony of defendant   Schlegelberger appear below in sections V B, V C 2 a, V D 2, V D   3, and V E. His entire testimony is recorded in the mimeographed   transcript (26, 27, 30 June, 1 July 1947, pp. 43674568).      [157] The portions of the record omitted here pertain to such   matters as the order of trial and the offers of documents. At   this point no testimony has been omitted.

[162] Prior to the Hitler regime, the administration of justice   was largely in the hands of the German Laender (States). When   Hitler abrogated the federal system, he also centralized the   administration of justice.      [163] Decree of the Fuehrer and Reich Chancellor concerning   Appointment of Civil Servants and Termination of Civil Service   Status, (Schlegelberger 127, Schlegelberger Def. Ex. 123), is   reproduced above in section IV B.      [164] According to the testimony of prosecution witness Ferber   (Tr. p. 1325) Heller and his mistress were riders in a taxicab.      [165] The defendant Westphal committed suicide in Nuernberg jail   after indictment but before the arraignment.      [166] Counsel refers to the testimony of the prosecution witness   Karl Ferber, (31 March, 1, 3, 8 April 1947, pp. 13121315,   13191466, 15761630, 16651746).

(See United States _vs._ Karl Brandt, et al., Vol.   I, p. 794, and Vol. II, p. 171 ff., this series.) Concerning the   time when Guertner received a copy of a Hitler notice regarding   euthanasia, the prosecution in the Justice Case introduced the   following document (630-PS, Pros. Ex. 383), the original of   which was on the letterhead of A. Hitler and dated Berlin, 1   September 1939:   Reichsleiter Bouhler and Dr. Brandt, M.D. are charged with the   responsibility of enlarging the authority of certain physicians   to be designated by name in such a manner that persons who   according to human judgment are incurable can, upon a most   careful diagnosis of their condition of sickness, be accorded a   mercy death.

This exhibit is not reproduced herein.[174] Thierack became Reich Minister of Justice in August 1942.[175] The defendant refers to the showing before the Tribunal of aGerman sound film showing scenes from the actual trial of some of thepersons allegedly involved in the attempt upon Hitlers life on 20 July1944 (NG-1019, Pros. Ex. 192). In that trial, Freisler acted as thepresiding judge of the Peoples Court.[176] Testimony is recorded in the mimeographed transcript, 28 April1947, pp. 26752691; 27162729.[177] This resolution is reproduced on page 204.[178] Hitlers speech to the Reichstag on 26 April 1942 (NG-752, Pros.Ex. 24) is reproduced below in section VC2a.[179] Dr. Ferdinand Behl testified as a prosecution witness.

Further testimony of defendant Schlegelberger,dealing with treatment of Jews, is also reproduced below, section V D 2.[185] This order was printed in _German Justice_ (DeutscheJustiz), 1934, 96th year, pp. 341 ff.[186] In the IMT trial, this document was identified as Document3751-PS and introduced in evidence as Exhibit USA-828.[187] Wilhelm Frick was one of the defendants sentenced to death bythe International Military Tribunal. Concerning Fricks relation toconcentration camps, the IMT stated, From the many complaints hereceived, and from the testimony of witnesses, the Tribunal concludesthat he knew of atrocities committed in these camps. (Trial of theMajor War Criminals, op. cit., vol. I, p. 300.)[188] The enclosure was not offered in evidence.[189] This document was taken from General Collection of Regulations,a secret publication of the Reich Security Main Office (RSHA) compilingnumerous regulations of concern to the various police agencies.[190] The introductory paragraphs of this regulation were omitted fromthe document as introduced in evidence by the defense. These paragraphsread as follows:The following regulations regarding protective custody go into effecton 1 February 1938. At the same time, the following are rescinded:a. My decree of 12 April 1934--I 3311 A/28.2 along with the supplementof 26 April 1934 and 10 July 1934 (directed to governments of thestates and to the Reichstatthalters).b.

Similarly,Staatsanwalt has ordinarily been translated as attorney general orpublic prosecutor.[192] Defense counsel often reproduced in their document booksdocuments which had previously been introduced as prosecution exhibits,and in these cases the document ordinarily acquired both a prosecutionand a defense exhibit number.[193] Document reproduced immediately above reports on two meetings ofthis conference.[194] Document is not signed.[195] The reference is to the widespread acts of violence against Jewsduring this time, a period often referred to as Crystal Week becauseof the large number of windows in Jewish stores which were broken.[196] Further parts of this report, dealing with the question of racepollution and the treatment of Jews, are reproduced below in section VD 2.[197] The exact status of the enclosures mentioned is not known.Since the letter itself was only a draft, the marginal notes of whichindicate that it was submitted to Dr. Guertners consideration morethan once, it is not clear whether the original list mentioned wasinitially compiled and then substituted by a completely new list, orwhether the list compiled initially was merely revised by new additionsas time passed. However, it should be pointed out that the listreproduced below, and which was submitted as part of the file as foundby Allied authorities, contains entries as late as 30 January 1940. Itshould also be noted that the three cases specifically mentioned in thedraft letter of 30 November 1939 (Latacz, Jacobs, and Gluth) are allcases mentioned in the following list.[198] The initials indicate that Dr. Crohne, a department chief in theReich Ministry of Justice, proposed this draft or, in any event saw itbefore it was shown to Reich Minister Guertner. Dr. Crohne was chief,first of Department III, and later of Department IV, in the ReichMinistry of Justice.[199] Concerning this list, see footnote on preceding page.[200] Otto Meissner was Chief of the Presidential Chancellery of theFuehrer and Reich Chancellor. He was a defendant in Case 11, UnitedStates _vs._ Ernst von Weizsaecker et al.

The lower courts do not grant to Jews the right to participatein court proceedings in _forma pauperis_. The district courtsuspended such a decision in one case. The refusal to grant this rightof participation in court proceedings in _forma pauperis_ is inaccordance with todays legal thinking. But since a direct legal basisis missing, the refusal is unsuitable. We therefore think it urgentlynecessary that a legal regulation or order is given, on the basis ofwhich the rights of a pauper can be denied to a Jew.[426] Document NG-1106, Prosecution Exhibit 462, reproduced in partabove in this section.[427] Reproduced above in this section.[428] In January 1944, at Thieracks request, defendant Klemm was madeUnder Secretary.[429] Document NG-1656, Prosecution Exhibit 535, above, earlier in thissection.[430] Further testimony of defendant Rothenberger denying knowledge offinal liquidation measures of Poles and Jews is reproduced in sectionV C 3 a.[431] Complete testimony is recorded in the mimeographed transcript,(9, 10, 11, 12, and 15 Sep 1947), pages 85108548, 85598805.[432] From these official files only the opinion and sentence of theNuernberg Special Court has been reproduced herein.

The decreeis reproduced as part of Document NG-715, Prosecution Exhibit 112, onpage 188.[498] Reference is made to the articles of the Reich Penal Codedefining treason. The provisions of this code concerning hightreason and treason were amended early in the Hitler regime bythe law of 24 April 1934, amending provisions of criminal law andcriminal procedure.

Article 91 ofthe Reich Penal Code, as amended by the law of 24 April 1934 reads,(1) Whoever established contact with a foreign government or a personacting for a foreign government with the intention of causing a war orforcible measures against the Reich or other serious disadvantages tothe Reich, will be punished by death. (2) Whoever established contactof the kind described in paragraph (1) with the intention of causingserious disadvantages for a national of the Reich, will be punishedwith hard labor for life or for not less than 5 years.[499] Article 2 of the Reich Penal Code, as amended by the LawAmending the Penal Code of 28 June 1935, introduced the principleof creation of law by analogous application of penal laws, anddeclared punishable any act which deserves punishment according to thefundamental idea of a penal law or the sound sentiment of the people.Extracts from this amending law are reproduced on page 176, as partof Document NG-715, Prosecution Exhibit 112. Article 91, paragraph2, of the Reich Criminal (Penal) Code, as amended, established theprinciple that intentional causing of serious disadvantages fora national of the Reich in connection with a foreign governmentwas treasonable. This provision, however, did not go so far as todeclare that acts against ethnic Germans of foreign nationalitycould constitute treason against Germany. Hence, the discussion ofArticle 2 of the Reich Penal Code as amended with its provision forpunishment according to the fundamental idea of a penal law or thesound sentiment of the people and the creation of law by analogousapplication of penal law.[500] This decree of 4 December 1941 is reproduced as part of DocumentNG-715, Prosecution Exhibit 112, on page 632.[501] Concerning the nullity plea, see section V C 1 b.[502] The decree of 5 September 1939 is reproduced as part of DocumentNG-715, Prosecution Exhibit 112, on page 188.[503] The relevant provisions of this law are reproduced on page 231 aspart of Document NG-715, Prosecution Exhibit 112.[504] The various articles of the Reich Penal Code mentioned in thissentence are all contained in the law of 24 April 1934, amendingprovisions of criminal law and criminal procedure.

On cross-examination,Buchthal said that the word might have been used occasionally in thetechnical language of the criminologist, but certainly not frequently.(_Tr. 74717474._)[538] For the decree establishing the nullity plea and other materialconcerning its application, see section V C 1 b.[539] Document 1393-PS, Prosecution Exhibit 508, reproduced in sectionIV B.[540] Reproduced as a part of Document NG-715, Prosecution Exhibit 112,on page 160.[541] This law of 20 December 1934, Document 1393-PS, ProsecutionExhibit 508, is reproduced in section IV B.[542] This document is discussed in extracts from the testimony ofdefendant Klemm, reproduced below in this section.[543] Entire testimony is recorded in the mimeographed transcript (9May 1947) pages 30213046.[544] The reference is to Article 130a of the Reich Penal Code,which was inserted into the Code by the Law of 26 February 1876:Imprudent Discussion of State Affairs by Ministers of Religion(Kanzelmissbrauch). 130a.

Beamte are classifiedaccording to four levels: Beamte of unteren Dienstes (lower level),einfachen mittleren Dienstes (intermediate level), gehobenenmittleren Dienstes (upper level), and hoeheren Dienstes (higherlevel). Angestellte are mainly custodial employees, workers, andminor clerks, but also include some specialists who do not haveBeamten-status.[686] Officials of the lower level are usually clerical employeesand are usually addressed with the title of their position (such asBuerovorsteher--chief clerk).[687] Usually carries a prefix such as Justiz, Regierung,Verwaltung, Ministerial, etc.[688] Equivalent to a senior colonel.[689] For detailed information on German court system see A BriefSummary of the Court System, in section IV C 2.[690] Term Assessor is also used in connection with probationalappointments in the administrative career service and the teachingcareer in university-level institutions.[691] Literal translation of Rechtswahrer is one who guards theobservation of law.[692] For offenses included in Wehrkraftzersetzung see NG-715,Prosecution Exhibit 112, in section IV B, pages 192 and 193.Transcribers Notes:1.
